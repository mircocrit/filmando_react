1;i actually found the movie to be funny, especially when the horse jumped over the ship and got chopped up by the propellars.
2;Very interesting story and a very, very descent horror film.
3;It doesn't have an ending yet, but THE RING 2 will premier this March.
4;i think it can be so scary because the entire structure of the movie takes you anywhere and everywhere.
5;The scary image set apart at a safe distance joins you in your safe little room.
6;inducing horror films ever, Yes, it's that shocking.
7;Still, I was glad to take the journey.
8;If the goal of a horror movie is to scare and tell a story, then the film truly has the goods to deliver.
9;Her own son, Aidan (David Dorfman) is much like Cole in `The Sixth Sense,' and his own supernatural take on dreams and drawings gives us more of an eerie feeling about the whole affair.
10;Her loved one (Martin Henderson) is drawn into the sleuthing mission, but his skepticism does much for the film's tension.
11;`The Ring' is a carefully crafted full.
12;(Sprinkling clues to bring participants to the truth of a mystery.
13;As a story it works.
14;It does have a mystery to unveil, and mostly it is a satisfying tale of tragedy, but I do have some complaints about the ending.
15;Filled with strange and creepy imagery, The Ring is a good watch.
16;The herione Rachel has to unravel the mystery which involves a young girl and her mother.
17;The acting is fairly good, although there are a few parts that I find amusing, *ex.
18;Watch it late at night alone and see what you think.
19;Twice in the theater, and twice at home.
20;I can honestly say, this is the scariest movie i have ever seen!
21;I love scary movies, and this one is a great!
22;the Ring really makes you think!
23;And the silence in this movie is one of the things that gets you.
24;All the little things in it that remind you of stuff you've seen before in the movie are very clever, and unique.
25;This movie was very well put together, and i think it deserves a ten out of ten!
26;Starting out with creepy black and white video images the film soon builds thick and eerie atmosphere and also succeeds in giving the viewer quite an early scare.
27;The gradually unfolding story is absorbing, constantly thrilling and splendidly supported by fine actors, an eerie soundtrack and visually stunning shots.
28;having watched The Ring three times by now I dare say it ranks among the best horror movies ever made.
29;The first Halloween movie was the best I came across.
30;I thought it looked sort of lame but also intriguing.
31;So I went to see it with a friend.
32;It was the best movie.
33;And that's what I love about it.
34;naomi Watts is one of my favorite actresses out there today .
35;she made a huge impression on me with her great performance in David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE, and she definitely didn't let me down here.
36;She's perfect for the role and she pulls it off beautifully, looking more and more tense as the plot thickens.
37;I liked her a lot more than RINGU's villain, Sadako.
38;Maybe I'll watch it again some time.
39;Once dismissed as an urban legend circulating among the high school set, the reporter confirms the actual existence of the tape and unwittingly views it herself.
40;She soon comes to the realization that the rumors about the tape's deadly effects are also true, and with the assistance of her ex.
41;the original Japanese film is dark, eerie and, though not particularly scary, is intense and engaging.
42;If you still want to see the ''Americanized'' version, regardless, then please be aware of these few important deviations and departures from the Original:(1): The ''Title'' .
43;In the original, Sadako was found very, Very, .
44;the set designs, the music, the cinematography, even the actors themselves .
45;(I give ''American'' version ''two stars'' here because, judging from the story it was originally adapted from, I'm sure it's probably still a pretty good and nicely done movie .
46;A camera that shows distorted faces is found!
47;Her son Aidan draws strange pictures.
48;I watched it, and I kept waiting.
49;But the way I look at scary movies is this.
50;I've seen both the American Ring and Ringu, which I own and I enjoy both!
51;The American version does move the story along at a faster pace than the original does.
52;Do see the Original version and then the American one and you will see the merits of both.
53;The Ring is a smart, psychological thriller about a video tape that possess those who watch it to die seven days later, with the help of journalist and grieving aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) tries to prevent the deaths of herself, her son, and ex.
54;The Ring is directed so good, I enjoyed this film from beginning to end, as always Naomi Watts is great as Rachel.
55;The Ring is a well.
56;If you can get past the ridiculous plot, this is actually a well constructed, suspenseful movie.
57;Namoi Watts, who is a fine actress decides to uncover the mystery after her neice mysteriously dies from watching the tape.
58;The original Ringu is much more subtle and can really shock you without any gore and special effects.
59;See Ringu and forget about The Ring.
60;I thought having a few quick flashes of scary stuff worked well, because you kept waiting for it to happen, but never knew when.
61;The ending is a good one because it doesn't follow typical Hollywood fare.
62;overall, I liked it quite a bit.
63;Well actually not, the plot is actually more elaborate than that and the movie goes into great detail at the end to explain that.
64;and the part where the little girl comes out the TV is a nice touch.
65;i'm waiting for the sequel, hopefully that one will explain more than this one did.
66;The movie is good for a quick visual scare, but thats it.
67;a solid effort, worth watching but not worth all the hype that was built up around it.
68;The Ring is a movie that successfully mingles dark imagery and a modern urban legend.
69;like plot with decent special effects and above average acting.
70;many others summarize the story, so I will instead share my thoughts on it.
71;but it quickly moves on to an intelligent and well thought.
72;out storyline that entertains us and moves along at a good pace.
73;While it is not predictable it is logical.
74;the movie finishes itself off with an ending that surprised some moviegoers.
75;Instead the Ring relies on solid writing and strong dialog to make it one of the best horror movies ever.
76;Name the last horror movie they really liked.
77;The writing, acting, and directing is all top.
78;This is important to me for a horror movie to work.
79;though I did think the movie was scary, I might also describe it as a thriller.
80;The surprise ending, which I in fact predicted, added to the appeal of the film.
81;As far as contradictions in the plot, few movies have a perfect story line.
82;This is one of the best.
83;the premise and basic storyline are brilliant.
84;The story that follows an investigation gives the writers a lot to work with.
85;The atmosphere is intense and the fact that many things are shown only briefly (like Samara's face) or not at all add to the appeal of the movie.
86;and that also sets up for a nice sequel too.
87;the story of someone dying after viewing a videotape is good.
88;They say they want to break away from formula Hollywood and make daring, bold, films.
89;But, I also noticed that many of these young new filmmaker are forgetting something.
90;The audience has to care about the characters.
91;All I ask is that I at least find the character to be interesting enough, where I'm willing to give my emotions to the character.
92;That's what makes a great movie.
93;blowing complex movies I've seen in a while.
94;i see a lot of people enjoy this movie.
95;And I do admire Naomi Watts as an actress.
96;I think she is very talented.
97;So, I was going into the movie with high expectations.
98;Just be able to hold my interest.
99;And The Ring does reach it goal.
100;It's actually enjoyable to watch at first, and than, it gets werid.
101;How ever werid Mulholland Dr. may have got, it always held my interest.
102;If they would of made the movie more believeable I could of enjoyed it more.
103;are there things to be enjoyed while watching this movie.
104;Well, if your a young filmmaker and you say you like to see movies with an edge , here you go!
105;Watts does in all fairness do a good job.
106;She does give the character a certain level of heart need to carry our interest, but, it seems like no one else is helping her out.
107;line: Has some good points to it, but, over.
108;Goes a bit over the top and becomes silly at moments.
109;Watts does though give a nice performance.
110;In certain cases these alterations are actually an improvement that contributes to the mood of the story, as well as providing hints and clues of the final conclusion.
111;In Japan, like in China and many other countries in Asia, they have long history that consists of countless mythical tales and legends about the spiritual realm, so a cursed video may seem vividly possible, while seems far.
112;The Ring is a material which M. Night Shyamalan could probably do while he sleepwalks, and his knack for psychological thrills and minimalism style would surely be effective here.
113;However with the limited amount of Gore (no puns intended), he did succeed in letting some genuine chills creep into the audiences at the sublimal level.
114;Naomi Watts serves up a decent job as a career.
115;In Alejandro Amenavar's The Others, in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, or even in the most obvious example, Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, children's straightforward manner and innocence proved to be far more effective in creating sense of peril, and in that matter, way more disturbing.
116;He has great presence, but again he does not convey any chemistry with the other actors in the film.
117;While the sound may not give your system a throughout workout, the localization is quite well defined, and provide a good dimension for the otherwise monotone sound effects, therefore making the few shock.
118;tricks exceptionally powerful (needless to say the DTS track again proves to be the champion of cinema sound).
119;I thought that the rest of the movie was good, but it felt like they stopped at that last scene and decided to to make any more.
120;the movie deemed the scariest movie of the year.
121;I say it is the best film of the year, of any genre.
122;It's a psychological thriller all of the way.
123;And such a great one that it sticks in your mind long after it's over.
124;if you like scary movies, you must see this one.
125;I deem it as the most original film of the year (even though it is a remake of the foreign film Ringu), and the best film of the year, hands down.
126;I first saw this movie in the theater,and I came out shaking.
127;for a movie that is only PG.13&lacks
128;she explores it with her boyfriend&her
129;naomi Watts is an excellent actress,turning what could've been a chessy horror flick into a haunting psychological thriller that will stay with you long after you've stopped watching.
130;all in all, I think that it was a good movie.
131;The shock value and plot twists make it very interesting.
132;The Ring is a top notch horror flick, right up to the end.
133;It definitely keeps you guessing the entire way, it's spaced well, and it does have a rather original plot when compared to the other horror fare out there.
134;Great movie, ruined by a vicious ending.
135;visual perspective, it's a very interesting movie.
136;wow, this movie creeped me out bigtime!
137;Watch this movie in daylight.
138;It's by far more intriguing to lead a viewer down a path and let their own imagination do most of the work.
139;I believe the rather jumpy cinematic style and story to The Ring accentuates this idea and becomes the catalyst for the few scares you will inevitably receive watching it.
140;for those of you out there that have the ability to see far beyond what's just on the screen.
141;for those that can see meaning and depth lurking in the far corners behind Hollywood shine, The Ring offers another dimension.
142;TV is everywhere, in every home, at every moment.
143;I have also seen the Japanese version and while some purists and those that fancy themselves non mainstream film buffs will tell you the foreign versions are always better i find that usually isnt the case.
144;I enjoyed this the first time very much but it seems to lose its luster with repeated viewings.
145;Creative, creepy thriller that pulls the viewer into the world of the ring from the very first scene.
146;It's the kind of movie that stays with you several days after you've seen it.
147;Really great plot to follow.
148;If you like scary movies that keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense, this is one to watch!
149;When this movie first came out everyone said that they loved it.
150;I have seen this many times and each time it creeps me out.
151;It is scary enough with just the story and the psychological stuff.
152;And the first time you see it, it really is a mystery, and the pieces fit together really well.
153;The acting is great, especially the kid's acting.
154;And I found the storyline to be rather solid.
155;i recommend you watch this if you haven't already.
156;This is one of the scariest smart movies, it is psychologically scary, it gets you the way Silence of the Lambs and The Exorcist gets you.
157;I dont think that hollywood these days has had many good horror flicks but thish proves to be a great one.
158;however, the movie more than makes up for that with it's beautifully created eerie and disturbing imagery.
159;is equally as well done has the same feel to it.
160;Everything about the movie is absolutely gorgeous.
161;I thought it had a great plot, and as other people have said it goes into great detail with the plot.
162;ANyways i had a lot of fun watching this movie!!!
163;The difference between the two films is that the ambiguous ending crafted and delivered in this particular film feels as though it BELONGS there.
164;i applaud the film for attempting to explain itself.
165;For this, I actually commend the film.
166;naomi Watts is a stunning and very capable actress, and I adore her here.
167;She doesn't raise any bars, because there are none to be raised, but she brings her natural talent to the table in full force, which is always edible.
168;When you factor in the visual style, which is magnetic to the sight, you have a film that nails a lot of what makes this genre so special.
169;Needless to say, they will be in for a surprise.
170;paced suspense film begins in Seattle with an urban legend.
171;Moments after you watch it, the phone rings, and a voice tells you, Seven days.
172;In a brilliantly edited sequence that is sure to make you drop your popcorn, Katie meets her fate, and we learn that the tale of the tape is no mere kids' story.
173;we see the tape in question early on, and at first it appears to be just a random series of weird images .
174;the acting in THE RING is fabulous throughout, with the actors stretching well beyond the caricatures all.
175;often found in horror films and creating realistic, intriguing people.
176;Here she (Naomi Watts) proves once again that she's an outstanding actress.
177;Martin Henderson, another actor from Down Under, is perfect as a videographer turned reluctant action hero, and young David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase are scary.
178;Amber Tamblyn (daughter of multitalented actor/singer/dancer Russ Tamblyn) and the engaging Rachael Bella do a wonderful job of starting the movie off with a scream, Lindsay Frost shines in a small but important role, and Jane Alexander (an actor's actor) is fun to watch as a doctor who knows more than she wants to.
179;The direction is crisp, stylish, and sure.
180;Even the lighting and sound are beautifully worked out
181;Hans Zimmer's soundtrack hits all the right notes, and the screenplay is smart, original, and pulls no punches.
182;if you love being scared, grab a hold of Verbinski's THE RING and hang on for the ride of your life.
183;This was a good movie,fun to watch and creepy.
184;naomi Watts acted good , the others where good too.
185;if you liked the sixth sense you will love the ring
186;I realize I'm in the minority, but I prefer The Ring to Ringu.
187;The ideas in the movie, almost more than anything else, always manage to disturb me.
188;I'm not usually a fan of horror, but I was very impressed by this movie.
189;The acting and cinematography are good, but what really stands out is the intricate storyline.
190;Symbolism and visual clues abound, and it's even more fun to watch the movie a second time to see how all the foreshadowing fits into the chilling conclusion.
191;this movie was based on the Japanese movie Ringu, which I have also seen, and I think the screenwriters did a good job of revising the movie into something that would be accessible to American viewers, while preserving the spirit and themes of the original.
192;It was so eerie and foreboding
193;I knew this film was going to be good.
194;I showed the preview to another close friend and she was immediately hooked.
195;Needless to say, we were both amazed.
196;This film is one of the greatest horror movies to come out of America in quite some time.
197;America needed a good ol' fashion terror invoking horror flick, and The Ring answered the call.
198;It is genuinely creepy and very well put together.
199;The cinematography and music alone make this movie a triumph.
200;This is as good as American horror films get.
201;This is a movie experience that will you leave you a bit rattled and maybe even leaving the light on for a few nights when you hit the sack.
202;What's truly great about this movie is that it has a little thing I like to call `sleeper.
203;This film definitely delivers in the terror department.
204;I give it five stars and a full recommendation.
205;It's a remarkable American horror film with rich Eastern roots.
206;I have to say, I was quite impressed with The Ring.
207;from the very first scene of the movie the eerie atmosphere is set very well.
208;It's a really refreshing take from recent films where the villian is obvious.
209;^_^
210;although parts of the movie are somewhat corny, and many reports of the movie are of course over hyped, you will indeed at least be creeped out and entertained throughout.
211;It's certainly worth seeing, and I'd recommend seeing it with a friend.
212;A good and quite original horror movie
213;If you are one of those that will easily get scared this is the project for you other wise just enjoy the suspense of this film and the visuals.
214;but the whole plotline of being killed after watching the movie was interesting.
215;this is a chilling movie and will no doubt scare the pants off alot of people.
216;It's a great psychological thriller because instead of using a gutted person hanging from a tree to freak you out, this movie messes with your mind and will make you want to turn off the TV forever when it's over.
217;Despite the fact that I don't think it is scary, I still think this is a great movie, with a great story.
218;visual experience is very satisfying indeed, but the story changes and the overall acting are very inferior to the original.
219;The story is very well thought and almost everything is explained, while the story in the ring is cut and paste with a few, unexplained changes like the mother .
220;One of my favorite horror movies of our time now in my collection.
221;Naomi is just a great actress.
222;I love to watch her movies.
223;I'd give this stylish thriller 5 stars for cinematography and 3 stars for its thriller value.
224;The music and the look of the film are chic and edgy .
225;extras include a nicely done 15.
226;The film can be heard in English or French and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.
227;You can also see trailers for Ringu, 8 Mile and Catch Me If You Can.
228;so why the generous 4 stars despite the rough.
229;I have always liked horror/thriller films so I assumed I'd like this one.
230;the movie is, well, about a movie.
231;I've been told that it's an adaptation of the Japanese movie Ringu and that one is better.
232;I personally love this movie.
233;So I say watch this movie to enjoy it, and don't worry about trying to figure out how the heck the evil tape got made in the first place.
234;(Seriously, it's a supernatural movie.
235;Bottom line: Entertaining movie with good actors, a creepy atmosphere, and an ending you'll never forget!
236;Also, a heck of a lot better than movies like Darkness Falls.
237;But this was a pleasant surprise to me.
238;Everything is so perfect about this movie .
239;wish I knew Japanese to see and enjoy the movie, reading English subs alone might not do the trick for me), which in turn is based on Koji Suzuki's novel by the same name.
240;naomi Watts and the supporting cast are well chosen.
241;The background score by Hans Zimmer elevates the film to a whole new level, mesmerizes you.
242;The strength of the whole movie lies in the suspense and the fear of the unknown it builds up.
243;But you have to take into consideration that that movie was made like 5 years ago and technology and film making have changed.
244;anyway, The Ring was a really cool, really scary movie that is DEFINATELY worth watching.
245;This Movie is one of the scariest movies i've seen.
246;If you want to see a great scary movie without all the blood guts and gory effects then this one is it.
247;This was the best scary movie I have seen in a long time.
248;The movie kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
249;It even stayed with you after you turned it off.
250;Have yet to see one better.
251;This is the SCARIEST movie I have seen since the Exorcist!
252;If you are into thrills, then this one is for you!!!
253;The Exorcist was actually a decent film with a storyline that didn't make you feel like you wanted to kill yourself.
254;Engulfed in dark, dreary images, filled with wet and foggy visuals, and a chilling tone, director Gore Verbinskicreates one of the moodiest, and most effective thrillers to invade our heads in a long time.
255;He creates such an intriguing and cold.
256;The story is chillingly and well conceived by screenwriter Ehren Krueger(Scream 3), and really takes you for a ride.
257;We then meet Seattle reporter Rachel(played by the strong and breathtakingly gorgeous Naomi Watts), and her little son Aidan, wonderfully and engaginly portrayed by young David Dorfman.
258;Aiding her in her mission is her friend Noah, played by Martin Henderson.
259;As I have already mentioned, Verbinksi fills his film with striking visuals and images that stay with you long after the film ends.
260;He knows how to make everything in a scene work, and play it for all it's worth.
261;The guy knows his way around a scare and how to set the right mood and atmosphere.
262;The actors here are all game and really give it their all.
263;I was the most impressed with young Dorfman.
264;I am not sure how old he is, but he was very appealing and had good screen presence.
265;Watts, a vision of total beauty, tackles her role with strength and intelligence and makes it real.
266;I just wished I hadn't waited so long to see the film that is definitley one of the best thrillers in years.
267;This was a good one.
268;tHE RING has a few good ideas, some gross FX, a reasonably entertaining and twisty storyline and a few chills.
269;She's the main character of the film, along with her son.
270;as I mention above, something very unusual about the film effects me in a way I can't explain.
271;First of all, the entire film is very effectively well.
272;I can't explain what it is but this is the main reason I find the movie so delightful.
273;This movie is a psychological thriller that will keep you up thinking about it.
274;You will have to watch The Ring multiple times to catch everything this mystery has to offer.
275;I think that this movie has an amazing plot that will keep you entwined all the way.
276;This rendition of the Japanese movie, Ringu , is a breath of fresh air!
277;It is a true example of a psycological thriller edging into horror.
278;The kind that made Hitchcock's movies so great, making the need for gore almost nonexistant.
279;It makes for a good film, if the hell can be scared out of you, without the teen slasher method of film.
280;The story is a fresh concept as well, unlike the much hackneyed vampire and dead.
281;I don't like horror movies at all and I actually went to see this at theater.
282;I heard this movie compared to The Sixth Sense, which was a great movie.
283;And the premise is great.
284;So I wanted to see why.
285;Everything about this movie is good except the ending and the answer to the above questions.
286;Naomi Watts inspects the tape with high.
287;I had the priveledge of seeing this in theaters and I was genuinely frightened.
288;The imagery and stark photography was enough, but coupled with phenomenal acting and an ending that simply blows your mind, this is definitely one of the best psychological horror films I have ever seen.
289;work and directing on this film are simply unmatched by most modern filmmakers in the genre.
290;overall, this is an extremely terrifying and intelligent film.
291;THE RING is, of course, the excellent American remake of the classic Japanese original, RINGU.
292;While both films are creepy and suspenseful, THE RING uses a more supernatural.
293;It is, truley, one of the most suspensful movies I have ever seen.
294;It had a well thought out plot, many great twists, and a FANTASTIC ending of which you could have never guessed!
295;I hear a sequel is in the works so hopefully that will shed some light on it.
296;She reminded me of the girl from the exorcist.
297;She zoomed in at him and he jumped off.
298;at first I thought it was a happy ending, but when that little boy said, She never sleeps!
299;I bought this movie yesterday and today I am selling this movie on Amazon.
300;In fact, it's a pretty good movie.
301;*laugh This movie is a psychological thriller.
302;This movie is definitely one of them!!!
303;This cat prefers to leave well enough alone.
304;*laugh Again, I recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for a good scare.
305;While the original RING stands as a intensely horrifying ghost story on its own, it is safe to say that the American remake is its own fresh take on the same story, adding to the horror of the original with thematic complexity and penetrating subtext.
306;While RING steams forward to the final climax with menacing intensity, THE RING creeps forward with a languid, contemplative pace.
307;Criticisms for being slow are inevitable, but to those who can appreciate it, THE RING ultimately benefits from the way it languishes on its vivid dreamscapes.
308;But my real point in writing this review is to praise the excellent adaptation this film is of its Japanese counterpart.
309;Scriptwriter Ehren Kruger adds his own version to the legend behind the tape, replacing psychics with unnatural conceptions, and scandal with tragedy.
310;It is finally the curse that leads Rachel Keller to take full role as a mother, and the empathy she creates with the plight of the neglected daughter Samara Morgan ultimately reflects on her own son.
311;Naomi Watts does a fine job of showing the growth her character makes, conveying real sadness and sensitivity as the film progresses, especially in the final scene.
312;there is a lot more to this film than one would think.
313;The final climax with the television has its own dark edge, even with the superior climax of the Japanese RING edging it out.
314;The final scene brings up a moral dilemma, though, that rivals the original in resonance.
315;They take one person's tragedy and force the world to experience it.
316;a great film, one of the best horror films in years.
317;The Exorcist is a much scarier film than this.
318;now that being said, I will say that this movie is scary.
319;Gore Verbinski is generally good at building suspense, and The little girl in it is pretty freaky, even though this whole 'Sinister and/or mysterious children' thing is kind of a cliche in horror movies.
320;The film moved at a good pace and was interesting and enough to keep me from never being bored, and it was cool how it eventually turned into a sort of family drama and the the very end was unexpecedly artsy.
321;i always thought of her as a nice sweet little (probably 10 year old) girl.
322;First of all, it just seems all the best movies are based on books.
323;I mean, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Time Machine is okay.
324;So, they made The Ring, based on a popular novel by Koji Suzuki.
325;She watches it and has 7 days to live.
326;It's a great horror movie and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get freaked.
327;This movie is very scary, extremely well.
328;It was also my distinct impression that this is a film most effective on the big screen (I did not see it in the theaters).
329;the best part about THE RING is its dynamic cinematography, brooding atmosphere, and unsettling mood.
330;It is superbly shot: The movie looks and feels like you're viewing it through an aquarium after midnight.
331;It is always raining in this mis.
332;scene, and that coupled with its smoky, steely, lonely backdrops made me realize, once again, how strangely influential the Brad Pitt classic, SE7EN, has been on these types of films.
333;Another major plus: the attractive, straight.
334;outback leads do solid work.
335;Naomi Watts is lovely, and screams better than any horror heroine I've seen in quite some time.
336;The excellent character actors Brian Cox and Jane Alexander also turn up here, breathing some more life into all this creepiness.
337;tHE RING does extremely well with fractured, nightmarish dreamscapes, bold startling images that burn themselves on your retina.
338;In this way, THE RING references the little known but actually pretty scary Robert Downey, Jr. annette Bening supernatural caper, IN DREAMS, and the visual artist Joel Peter Witkin, who inspired all those NINE INCH NAILS videos.
339;The movie is genuinely frightening without resorting to much violence or gore.
340;It maintains its tension throughout, and in this way is similar to both SIGNS and the MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, both of which are better films.
341;It is scary, fun to watch, builds momentum, but makes no sense at the end, so in this way pays tribute to the most talked about cult horror.
342;It's structured well, looks great naturally, and has a clever set.
343;I thought it was infinitely scarier and more believable than the ridiculous Signs.
344;I found Naomi Watts to be wonderful in this role, almost as impressive as her part in Mulholland Drive.
345;She really held this movie together for me, because I wasn't particularly enamoured with the other actors (not to say that they were bad).
346;Nice movie, has an interesting plot and some exciting moments.
347;Its not that scary but it certanily does a good job of creeping me out!
348;This is good Halloween flick and I cannot wait until The Ring 2 comes out in November!
349;Naomi Watts is a very good actress and really shines in this role.
350;A good, tense horror flick that had me on the edge of my seat.
351;The Ring is best viewed for its subconsciously affecting elements.
352;But the chills which it provides are quite intense, if you'll let them be.
353;For example, in modern society it is very easy to go a lifetime without confronting the terrifying situations of being trapped in a well or chased by a maverick horse.
354;It is in visceral thrills like these that The Ring excels.
355;Many classic horror movies explain themselves away in the end, but they do so fully, in a way that makes the audience say, Ah!
356;But the deleted scenes montage is quite well.
357;At any rate, the deleted scenes are worth checking out.
358;But it does give you an idea of what the Japanese version looks like.
359;the opening sequence is pretty much an homage to the movie Scream.
360;From the opening sequence the movie hooked me.
361;After this well directed opening sequence, we get into the real story.
362;i liked this film alot!
363;But I was cool with the movie as a whole.
364;The ending, which is what a lot of people I spoke with before hand didn't like, was good.
365;I was happy to see that this movie was not disrespectful to the Horror Genre.
366;She should be famous already, and the camera loves her.
367;Gore Verbinski's direction is tight, clean, and suspenseful without too much gore.
368;The Ring is the scariest movie I have ever seen.
369;I love it and I love the effect it had on me.
370;I thought I needed to see it, also.
371;That's right, all they had to do was look at her, and they died.
372;If you ask me, that's a pretty nice and peaceful way to die.
373;This was the golden era of horror,and gave us some good scares.
374;The Ring is a rollercoaster ride with no seatbelts and just when you think the ride is over the cars fly completely off the tracks.
375;It's the scariest film I've seen in years.
376;One of the truly scary movies produced by a major studio.
377;Catch the Japanese edition if you can, it is quite an experience
378;So they try to calm the spirit and put it to rest but this spirit can't be put to rest.
379;She didn't die right away in the well.
380;While I am not one for horror films, I went to go see The Ring in theatres and actually enjoyed it.
381;The plot moves steadily along, seldom dragging.
382;The atmosphere is foreboding, some scenes are heart.
383;it's a good flick with a weird ending.
384;The Ring was an awesome movie.
385;i sure as heck aint seeing it again though.
386;no offense,but i thought it was a heck of a lot scarier than the Japanese version.
387;I enjoy good horror movies and this is good.
388;When a group of teenagers view a movie while at a cabin they seal their fate.
389;spooky images, dead horses, visions of ladders, wells, and more along with some good acting make this worth seeing.
390;When she told her son that we just watched The Ring we all had a laugh.
391;The Ring is not only scarier but it looks better and it keeps you entertained.
392;The plot is kind of interesting, however, the movie doesn't explain everything it should.
393;If you don't mind having questions about the movie that will not get answered, the visual effects might keep you happy.
394;The director does a terrific job of setting the mood and sense of eerieness and dread throughout the entire film.
395;sure the movie is still an effective and thought.
396;provoking horror, but that is entirely due to the magnificence of the original.
397;and, thanks to her investigative curiosity, she watches it.
398;up of her contracting pupil shows her true emotions: fear.
399;That would be an interesting first date.
400;This leads to a complex chain of events (with MANY subliminal messages.
401;look carefully at the transition between the horse.
402;i liked the way that it had a complex plot that really needs to be thought over.
403;Also, the graphics are so amazing I would never think they existed.
404;this movie is a must.
405;see for everyone who is ready to think.
406;Practically the whole movie is quiet in the background.
407;When there is music, it sends chills down your spine.
408;Everytime you see this film, you notice something new.
409;A lot of the things you notice will scare the heck out of you, too.
410;It scares you psychologically with smart images, a unique story, and terrifying scenes.
411;It's great movie, that's just on the brink of comfortable scary, and a little too scary.
412;This movie somehow targets what scares you most and intensifies it for 2 hours.
413;See this movie, if you dare.
414;I had so much anticipation for this film, everybody I knew recomended me this movie, stating it was one of the scariest films ever seen.
415;It actually gives an interesting plot which makes it eager to know what happens next.
416;for those who haven't seen it, see it!
417;The Ring WILL do this to some people, particularly if it's late and you're alone.
418;The Ring was made to stand alone.
419;It has some scary and suspenseful moment.
420;And thats what this movie is.
421;this is an excellent movie on it's own, and I wont get into the schematics of the story as one other has already done so.
422;Yes it is a great movie.
423;existing story (make that stories) to truly appreciate it.
424;Give it a shot and taste a thinking man's movie.
425;This film has mood and mystery, a decent cast, an interesting production design.
426;As a mood piece with some clever effects, this is worth watching.
427;Worth taking a chance on.
428;great story, great effects, great acting, i recommend this movie to any horror movie person
429;For it's time, The Ring was probably the best horror movie of all time and is still considered one of the greatest.
430;The girl's cousin and her aunt then delve deeper into what caused her death and what they find is pretty shocking.
431;You think you solved it when really you solve it after the boy reveals something about the curse at the end of the movie!
432;This movie is a must for Horror movie fans, one of the best Horror movies made to date!
433;This film worked beneath my skin, striking multiple chords and leaving me genuinely creeped out.
434;Film director Gore Verbinski has done an excellent job in remaking the 1998 Japanese horror classic Ringu.
435;Ringu is superior, only because it came first.
436;But The Ring is as frightening a ghost story as you are most likely to see.
437;and that is really all that The Ring is at heart .
438;Like The Sixth Sense, another stylish ghost story enjoyed by American masses, The Ring creates an ominous, supernatural sense of doom.
439;The Ring succeeds because of the eerie sense of mood it creates.
440;In The Ring, it is whispers emanating from dark places you will remember most.
441;This is by far one of the scariest I have seen.
442;If you enjoyed the Shining, or any thing to do with ghosts and murder etc.
443;Most of the people that I know that liked this movie always say that it's good because of it's amazing storyline, well let me tell you somthing.
444;The plot was full of twists, which is appealing to me.
445;worthy, if you are into that.
446;i want to see it several more times, since I always pick up more from a movie the more I've seen it.
447;First of all this is most certainly NOT your typical horror movie.
448;the visualizations of this film rely on skillful lighting, subtle sounds and great acting.
449;Director Gore Verbinski has created a film that will be a tough act to follow.
450;a wonderful piece of work.
451;Will do repeat business with in the future.
452;Thanks Guys In great shape, was best place to find after loosing years ago.
453;brow (owing, most likely, to the attachment to DreamWorks).
454;She goes and picks up the photos.
455;Even if she didn't know, what is so initially compelling about a business card?
456;The movie has fabulous cinematography, subtle sound and imagery, and a neat conceptual parallel to the book it's based on, but the end result likens to Scream and I think someone should be severely punished for it.
457;This was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen!
458;This is one of those tense films whereas it keeps your stomach clenched until the last scene.
459;amusing, but just not good enough to invest any amount of time or money in.
460;Just my opinion, but a lot of folks liked this movie.
461;It is worth a watch, so one can know where a bunch of pop culture references in other shows/movies come from.
462;A remake of a Japanese film titled Ringu (1998), which I have yet to see, The Ring (2002) is a genuinely creepy tale of a cursed video, one that results in the death of anyone, within seven days, who happens to watch it.
463;I finally did watch it about a year and a half ago, and then again last night, and after doing so, I was very impressed.
464;While I may not have liked the characters all that much, I thought the performances were well done, and the direction taut and engaging.
465;I did like the twists at the end, one of which involved Noah and provided for one of the more memorable and disturbing visuals in the film.
466;Also included, as a slightly hidden feature, is a complete showing of the material present on the `cursed' tape, which last roughly two minutes, if you dare.
467;I had high hopes for this film, since it didn't appear from the commercials and trailer to have much in the way of what I like to call idiot moments.
468;For starters, while the basic notion is pretty much implausible, it's done with enough style and is well executed enough that you can and do tend to overlook its faults.
469;The bluish lighting, and constant rainfall of the Seattle locations are effective at setting the mood, and probably don't even need the well.
470;In this particular case, it's handled pretty effectively.
471;In this film, it's much more subtle.
472;good:The basic story is an OK premise for a late.
473;I will say, Rick Baker's makeup effects for the girl and her victims are very effective, made all the more so by their fleeting, almost subliminal appearances on screen.
474;It's certainly the way the writer set up a potential sequel.
475;Granted, that could be pretty expensive, and it may be cause to shut her up in the stable/barn ( You'll stay here until you and the horses can get along, young lady! )
476;i guess the long and the short of it is that it's a pretty visually effective movie (audibly effective, too .
477;That's always been my touchstone for good scary movies.
478;The radiant Naomi Watts stars in her first film after her breakthrough role in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive.
479;If that hadn't already made her a star, the box office success of this film would have.
480;It showcases her best abilities in a more accessible form.
481;This sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film, as well as giving Watts something to investigate (Tamblyn plays her niece).
482;There will come a day .
483;As an adult, I thought that scary movies were things of the past.
484;It is actually intelligently written and directed.
485;i think a rarity for the scary movie genre.
486;the acting is believable and genuine, even the children and teens perform well and add to the climate of fear.
487;the story takes a few twists and is unpredictable until the very end.
488;Having just watched The Ring a few nights ago the film is still very vivid and powerful.
489;Her young son, superbly played by David Dorfman and ex boyfriend (Kiwi Martin Henderson) are drawn into the mystery as well.
490;With wonderful cinematography and haunting music (also periods of creepy silence) this is a film you cant easily forget or get out of your head!
491;A couple of details make this B. movie a cult classic.
492;The film within the film was spooky, but deliciously abstact and surreal.
493;Also the whole concept that the viewer is part of the cycle.
494;A guilty pleasure, but it has its charms.
495;Turn off your brain and enjoy!
496;it was a nice relief from the norm.
497;I was pleasantly surprised by it.
498;it messes with your mind.
499;the implications of things is so far superior to your typical special effects hollywood horror film that many peope need to name something as horror.
500;being a fan of japanese cinema, and its methods, i expect to be just as creeped out.
501;This movie has got to be the scariest movie made in the last ten years.
502;In my oppinion, it ranks higher than The Sixth sense and The Others.
503;I mean I laughed at the Blair Witch and cried at SignsNow there are some confusing parts.
504;the Ring is so much better in the terms of you won't see one beheading or a beating heart in the two hours that this movie takes to watch.
505;She finds and watches a mysterious video tape that will bring about your demise exactly seven days later.
506;i just loved Naomi Watts in this movie.
507;I belive she has a big future in Hollowood.
508;I also thought Bryan Cox was great in his performance.
509;They have great chemistry in the movie and I can't wait to see more from the both of them.
510;I think it will be well worth it!
511;Like the previous reviewer, the use of sound was great, sound and sudden grotesque images.
512;I ended up watching it about 3 times before taking it back and doing alot of freeze frame viewing.
513;The suspense the director holds you in is tremendous.
514;Plus it takes alot of unforeseen turns that keep you guessing.
515;I'd rate it close to The 6th sense for good endings.
516;ending search for further insight into its darkly beautiful truth.
517;The plot is, naturally, a little on the weird side, but it certainly seems straightforward enough for me to wonder why some viewers claim they did not understand the movie.
518;I can assure you that the final plot twists and ultimate ending will delight you and renew your faith in truly original movies of this genre.
519;I should add the fact that the ending does much to counterbalance the riveting early moments of the film.
520;In my opinion, the opening scene here is the creepiest, most powerful beginning to a horror movie I have ever seen, and I assure you that this is a very bold statement on my part.
521;The cast, I must say, is wonderful.
522;Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson help sell the mysterious truth about the tape to any viewers reluctant to suspend their disbelief, but it is the children who make this movie a truly creepy good time.
523;The mysterious child Samara is the pivotal character in this film, the conduit for all of the horror and psychological manifestations of dread and fear, and Daveigh Chase is uncannily remarkable in the role.
524;With so many artistic nuances complementing a wildly unpredictable plot, I would dearly love to have the director or an actor or two offer their thoughts on the process in the form of a commentary.
525;seen short film of roughly 15 minutes is good, but I can't say that it really delivered many new revelations about The Ring.
526;There was one additional piece of information I picked up that works on a psychological level, but overall it is certainly not a Rosetta Stone with which to translate the secrets of the film.
527;one of the best horror movies of all times, excellent performances , and the plot is great, amazing effects and photography, sure i recommend this movie.
528;they said it was a little scary but it wasnt the scariest movie they have ever seen.
529;This movie creeps you in a subtle but creative way.
530;'The Ring' frightens but also leaves you with many unanswered questions.
531;this movie is so awesome!
532;i love this movie if u know a person who loves horror and mystery flicks this is the one!
533;I'm not a big fan of horror flicks but this is one of my all times favorites.
534;And it has an interesting story line.
535;The director uses imagery, colors, and builds the tension in a way that draws the viewer in and fills you with dread for the lead character played by Naomi Watts.
536;This is a great horror film to add to your collection.
537;Give this movie a try and you won't be disappointed.
538;This is easily one of the dumbest mainstream movies released in recent years.
539;the setting for the plot is perfect.
540;and visual effects are very effective.
541;dont count on it muahahahhahah!
542;Okay, I gotta explain something.
543;I have to see it again!
544;Third time around, my buddy Chris Morici and I were the only ones in the theater, which meant we could do a running commentary about what the movie did for us.
545;That Samara will keep you up at night.
546;This is one creepy movie, and a fine successor to the film The Sixth Sense.
547;For all of those people who read the previous reviews saying how great this film was.
548;Love to see it many times and never get tired of that movie, still love them.
549;But immediately after seeing it, Rachel receives a phone call that sets everything in motion.
550;Director Verbinski makes sure that the viewer must pay attention to every word, and this intense demand on the viewer increases the tension.
551;As Rachel discovers the meaning of each image, the suspense mounts, especially when her friend Noah (Martin Henderson) and her small son Aidan (David Dorfman) become involved.
552;Watts does an admirable job keeping her character grounded and real, and that goes a long way in upping the stakes for the viewer.
553;this chilling film relies heavily on atmosphere and anticipation to evoke its horror.
554;Convoluted visuals and a half.
555;It starts out with a promising story line.
556;This movie is the scariest one I've seen since SIXTH SENSE, and for pretty much the same reason: rather than going for the grossout, with blood, guts and startle responses, this movie creates and manifests an air of psychological horror, and it does so in a unique way.
557;Carried over into the adaptation are some themes common to much Japanese fiction (especially manga and anime) about humanity's relationship with technology.
558;THE RING manages to play on many aspects of this relationship.
559;the anonymity of unseen voices coming over cell phones, what exactly it is the camera captures when pictures are taken, etc. to excellent, and terrifying effect.
560;The most striking moment in the film.
561;It is very good though.
562;After watching this movie I immediately bought the book it is based on and the Japanese version of the movie.
563;This movie is the scariest I've seen in a long time.
564;the best part about this movie is that just when you think it's over .
565;And the makeup effects are great, too!!!
566;Rick Baker did the makeup and anyone who's seen American Werewolf in London knows that he's a genius.
567;i loved the style, the look of it, all green and mildewy and dark.
568;that horror can and SHOULD be beautiful, it should be quiet, dark, haunting.
569;the first part of the film is so artistic, so gorgeous, full of symbols and themes
570;i love a movie that creeps in with an outrageous story, but presents it in such a way that you start to believe it.
571;if you are a fan of pure psychological horror/thrillers, you will go crazy over the first part, and the last bit will disappoint.
572;On a good note the scenery is very beautiful, with all the fog and how it's dark and dismal which gives the movie a very creepy feeling that I liked.
573;the movie's very well made.
574;as for THE RING, the visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is excellent, but when you try to add it all up, you end up with more questions than answers, and pretty pedestrian questions, at that.
575;The deleted scenes feel as creepy and suspensful as the original, as well as offering a few nice pointed observations from the townsfolk to fill in a bit of the Morgans' story.
576;Much better than the average Hollow.
577;What she discovers is quite shocking.
578;That's all that I will tell you about the story.
579;This was a great film!
580;It was spooky, had a great atmosphere, and it had an original story!
581;And to anybody that says, Ringu is better, well, Ringu is a great foreign film, but I like the Ring better.
582;This is not a particularly scary movie, but it is kind of fun to watch.
583;The story started unraveling, and the pieces of the puzzle started coming together in an intriguing way.
584;It wasn't too scary, but it was fun.
585;This was a decent movie with a lot of shortcomings.
586;not too scary, but it was a fun watch.
587;It'll be fun to watch once or twice.
588;It's an okay fun story.
589;I saw this movie a long time ago but then I saw the trailer for The ring 2 so I thought I should write a review for this one.
590;The acting in this movie is very good and it is well directed.
591;I've seen both American and Japanese versions of the movie (American first) and I enjoyed American version much better since it is much scarier.
592;Yeah, some things as mentioned by previous reviewer were done better in the original but the winning factor of American version is that it is much scarrier than the original.
593;I can guarantee you that you'll be scared.
594;The Ring is that rare animal, a remake that actually manages to be as good as the original, although there are differences between the two films.
595;this film contains real suspense and genuine moments of fear.
596;There is also very little gore, instead the film's delivery is via its shock value, and in this it succeeds very well.
597;Naomi Watts turns in a strong performance and has a strong cast with her, including actors like Brian Cox who mirror Watts' with strong performances of their own.
598;Add to this some genuinely frightening scenes, and you have a great movie for Halloween viewing.
599;taken as a whole, this is a high calibre horror film and is recommended to anyone who is a fan of the genre or who just wants a good, scary film to watch.
600;This was a really good American.
601;ified remake of an excellent Japanese movie.
602;The original, Ringu, was awesome but actually took some research from me to understand it.
603;According to legend, the viewer will die in seven days.
604;All that and more will be answered.
605;Well done movie and Naomi Watts is an excellent actress.
606;The Ring moved me in a way no other scary movie has.
607;This movie was way beyond disturbing, but that is what makes it so good.
608;I look forward to viewing this movie a second, third, fourth, and maybe if i'm not completely scarred for life, I will watch it a fifth time.
609;This movie is extremely eerie and if you are a horror fan, watch this.
610;This is a good movie to watch on Halloween night with your friends with all the lights off.
611;Have a spooky good time watching this, I know you will!
612;And it's one of the best horror movies this old geezer has seen in a long, long time.
613;tHE RING works so well because it's effects are entirely cerebral.
614;Many other horror films are paced and structured accordingly.
615;Once I got past the idea that I was expected to be terrified in watching The Ring, I began to enjoy myself a whole lot more.
616;That such a fuss was made of a VHS tape (right down to references its timecode) is a real stretch.
617;but once I figured out that The Ring isn't really a horror film, I was able to accept it much more on its own terms.
618;Believe it or not, that was a fantastic acting turn, and Watts gives The Ring the same grace, sympathy and emotional commitment that has made her great.
619;She has a special knack for layering every emotional moment with precisely its opposite spectrum .
620;moments of anger turn into sorrow
621;The lines are crisper and better thought out than in modern horror brethren like FearDotCom, and the visual and story setups and payoffs are quite satisfying.
622;passer, and at its best, it is a pretty good mythical drama which showcases a brilliant actress, who is finally getting the attention she deserves.
623;By that, I mean that the look, sound, and perfomances are are all very good.
624;On a basic level it works better as an unsettling story than as an out.
625;Watts is quite good and certainly her performance helps the viewer to go along for the ride a little longer than one would necessarily do otherwise.
626;This is one of the better horror type movies to come along in quite a while!
627;Many are saying this is the scariest movie in ages.
628;That's not to say it's not a good movie, in fact it's very good, with some borderline great performances.
629;Definitely watch it for yourself and decide.
630;She comes in front of me and says, everyone will suffer.
631;so entertaining, i couldn't sleep for days after this movie.
632;Then when he told me it was actually good, I laughed even harder!
633;My husband knows me better than anybody else, and when he informed me that I would actually like it, I had to give it a try.
634;I believe it has more to do with the cinematography itself than the story, but I also like the fact that they don't rely on gore to scare you.
635;And that is a feeling that I cherish while watching horror movies.
636;All I can say is: move over, M. Night Shyamalan, make room for Gore Verbiniski.
637;the haunting atmosphere makes this movie more than just a ghost story.
638;Set in a rather rainy and gloomy Pacific Northwest by an excellent cinematographer, it uses a lot of natural light as the better X Files series did.
639;Beyond being a thumping good supernatural thriller, The Ring is a dark mystery, very dark indeed.
640;i have not seen Ringu, the Japanese version, so I am reviewing this film with objective mind and fresh stand.
641;Carl Jung proposed universal archetypes that human minds all share, and that is what grabs your mind at a terrifying subconscious level when you view it.
642;and THAT is what is scary and what Verbinski conjures so well: he knows that we scare ourselves, and all a really good director like Verbinski needs to do is take us there, and we can scare ourselves to death.
643;Then, and this is the kicker, she makes COPIES of the tape, and leaves the copies around for friends and loved ones to stumble upon.
644;There are some mild scares in The Ring, but it's essentially a scary movie for people who are scared by everything.
645;And if you can figure out why the film's twist ending is actually a twist, please let me know.
646;Ok, first off, I thought this was a very good movie, even almost scary in parts, but I couldn't help fight the feeling of deva vu I was having.
647;IT will just keep calling you back until you pick up, then you have 7 days.
648;Funny, I don't remember camcorders being around in the 60's.
649;This movie, although a remake of some japanese film, is strong enough to hold its own and is simply amazing.
650;The Ring is incredible, watch it!
651;Every horror buff knows .
652;building terror that keeps twisting right up to the end.
653;And it achieves the distinction of being almost as atmospheric and haunting as the original.
654;lots of grey skies and overflowing water.
655;It comes from the building tension as Rachel's deadline creeps toward us, and brief flashes of Samara's influence .
656;Henderson is also good, whether as a flip carefree artist or as a caring ex.
657;In keeping with the watery theme of the movie, she always seems vaguely damp.
658;The Ring is one of those rarest kinds of movies .
659;Excellent direction, great acting, and the haunting determination to never, ever watch an unlabeled movie again.
660;And please don't mistake me, it's not so much i mind remakes but if you are going to take the time to do so, lets at least try and make it better than the original (i. e. KING KONG is an example where this succeeded, and yes i know King Kong isn't horror but you get the point).
661;It's free and works better than all the digital imagery and special effects anyone could ever muster.
662;still it plays with ones imagination, makes you think, and holds your attention unlike most horror movies these days.
663;The ending is the best part of the movie.
664;You have to see the whole movie to really understand it.
665;acually i give it 1 and a half stars.
666;the story is good but the movie has a few scares at best and is way to long.
667;when i first saw the opening scene i thought this could be a good movie.
668;a reporter who just viewed the tape must unlock the mystery before her times up.
669;The end is rather interesting, to say the least.
670;this has Sequel written all over it.
671;excellent use of music and sound(or quiet)to set the mood.
672;a very quiet movie that forces you to turn up the volume.
673;this is a scary mystery story.
674;Oh, that's what The Ring is.
675;it's entertaining, but nothing spectacular.
676;Always the subtle, always the implied.
677;One can see how things move from one point to the next
678;This is, after all, a SUPERNATURAL horror story, and there are similar myths of curses taking the form of symbols, icons, and other writings and drawings
679;Judging just this version of the story, I thought it was excellent.
680;once her fate is set, each scene starts by giving you the date.
681;nevertheless, this movie is very engrossing as she comes across each new and bizarre clue.
682;When she finally unravels the mystery, I thought it was a fascinating story, but also a little confusing, too.
683;i still give this a high rating, though, for the entertainment and shock value.
684;Having seen both of them, and having liked the original alot I came into the theatre very skeptical.
685;This movie is visually more frightening and more scary than the Japanese.
686;Though Espers, telepaths, and the like are key elements in Japanese horror they don't translate well to Western audiences.
687;overall I liked The Ring and I found it more scary than the original.
688;Yes, Naomi Watts is a fantastic beautiful actress and does a great job along with the boy who plays her son.
689;Yes, the plotline was a fantastic one that could have been developed better.
690;Naomi Watts is solid in this Americanized remake.
691;I enjoyed when I saw it for the first time and I recommend this to any Naomi Watts fan.
692;p>There's some disturbing visuals, a somewhat original premise based on the original Japanese film, some solid acting (especially from Watts and the boy) .
693;Watching Exorcist again after all these years most certainly does.
694;It is a well shot scene and if you don't see it coming, it'll scare the beejesus out of you.
695;This American remake of the 1998 Japanese classic Ringu does a fairly good job of staying true to the original film, and novel somewhat.
696;Gore Verbinski does a good job of keeping the visuals pretty chilling throughout the film.
697;In the end, this film is a very decent and fresh addition to a rather stale genre in American cinema.
698;For a step in a new direction, I recommend at least one viewing of this film, if only for fun.
699;I watched both the original Japanese version and the American remake, and I must say that I still prefer the original.
700;The American remake is pretty good, but the silent eeriness that's constant in the original works more for me rather than the high.
701;wise, Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson are more believable.
702;Plus, Brian Cox is in the film, so it brings my grade up a notch.
703;all in all, The American Ring works for its shock effects and its horrifying climax.
704;I saw this movie in the opening weekend and I'm still scared.
705;I've literally slept with the light on ever since.
706;a remake of the Japanese hit Ringu, this is probably the best horror movie of the last 10 years.
707;It has good performances from the ensemble cast (although the child star David Dorfman is rather charmless), a sinister storyline (although a bit confusing) and some effective visuals.
708;Also interesting is the film's overall look.
709;There is a lot of grey skies and rain on display.
710;sized villain with a heart of stone and a mind full of vengeance.
711;She remains a mysterious, silent, face.
712;But considering The Ring is the best fright film Hollywood has given us in a very, very long time, it's a small price to pay.
713;You might want to double your pleasure and follow it up with it's much inferior but still watchable sequel The Ring Two.
714;Perfect weekend thrill for a nightly scare.
715;It did have jumps and twists that were indeed frightening, but what I really like the film is the originality of it, and the perfectness.
716;rachel Keller (the gorgeous Naomi Watts) is pretty much set into two words.
717;Her son Aidan will show to that.
718;The acting in the movie is so good, it's scary.
719;Naomi Watts as the young Rachel with her child did a good job at portraying a woman who has obviously gone through a lot in the past.
720;David Dorfman as the independent Aidan did amazing also.
721;there's a strange way that the ring captures audiences, which is why it was such a box office hit.
722;the affects and suspense in the movie do indeed add up to a lot of satisfying events, even some funny moments, but as tedious as the title may seem, it is relevant to the story.
723;Some of the things in here (say the affects) are so perfect, that it makes you wonder how dreamworks pulled it off.
724;she is the star of the movie and is the main protagonist.
725;These movies typically have very memorable scenes that engrave unforgettable images people will talk about time and time again.
726;Soon after, what was once a small little horror film becomes a timeless classic.
727;THE RING (which is a remake of the Japanese film RINGU) is definitely one of these movies.
728;** SPOILER ALERT **The plot is relatively simple, but is executed very well.
729;A mysterious video is circulating around.
730;She discovers the video and decides to watch it for herself (we also get to view the entire video).
731;The video is very unsettling and does an excellent job in spooking the audience.
732;the movie holds our interest tightly as pieces of the puzzle are discovered while other new questions are risen.
733;There are also a lot of wonderful, yet subtle techniques used to further intensify the mood:1.
734;The documentary footage of Samara's clinical studies further elevated the film's legitimacy.
735;That was a very nice touch as it also made the audience sympathize with Samara even more.3.
736;Another one of those memorable images engraved in my mind now.5.
737;I felt the intensity of many scenes of this movie alone was enough to push its rating to R level even though there was almost no blood or gore.
738;** END SPOILER ALERT **This movie was very well constructed and will easily please both the casual and the more critical detail.
739;The movie's pacing builds to a nice crescendo and it doesn't fall victim to overused clich s. Just when you think it was about to, another surprise is in store!
740;For those who would ask which one to see, I would recommend watching both, but to see the American version first as it definitely has better production value (both are about equally scary).
741;This is defiently a must see movie!
742;This is one of the most scarriest movies, since the Sixth Sense.
743;Just maybe, this movie can teach us about real life.
744;This movie is a ride that will take you to the edge of your seat!
745;I love all things foreign.
746;Really, I just love J. horror's and Asia Extreme.
747;So, The Ring is the story of Rachel Keller who has to take care of her son, Aidan.
748;some unwritten rule that children are naturally curious.
749;Although I bitch, and I do it quite frequently, about movie remakes, The Ring is one of my favorites!
750;It has a lot of scare factors.
751;And kids are always creepy in movies like 'The Ring'Gore Verbinski is an amazing director and his job on 'The Ring' was no exception.
752;I'm fairly confident he didn't direct The Ring 2 but he did a great job on The Ring.
753;Building up suspense and having scares at all the right times!
754;The acting in The Ring was also excellent!
755;I love Naomi Watts (Rachel Keller) so there is really no surprise that I loved her in this movie!
756;It should definitely be part of any horror movie collection!
757;I'll admit I do get scared more easily than some people, but until I saw this movie, it was just fun.
758;Very scary, but very good.
759;And right away the movie has our interest, because we're wondering, What did we just see, and why did it literally scare her to death?
760;with the clock ticking, Rachel races to uncover the mystery of the tape.
761;It has all the standard elements of a supernatural thriller.
762;Where The Ring succeeds is in its central mystery, its muted atmosphere, its unsettling soundtrack, and some genuinely scary moments that .
763;well, this is horror at its most potent, and it makes up for the film's shortcomings.
764;naomi Watts has real star power, as evidenced by the arc of her movie career.
765;Martin Henderson is likable, even though his character is left by the wayside.
766;David Dorfman does a nice job as the kid, even though he's an obvious rip.
767;Brian Cox has an effective cameo as a reclusive old man, and Daveigh Chase, that sweet.
768;The Ring is based strongly on a popular Japanese horror film that, according to most sources, is even better.
769;I will see it in due time.
770;For now, I'll just give thanks to this American film for scaring my pants off.
771;She finds the tape at a lodging place and watches it.
772;a tense Mystery/Horror that disturbs the mind as well as the senses.
773;It's a movie that hitchcok would be proud of.
774;Finally, the Japanese horror flick Ringu meets the American horror culture, and the results are better than one would expect.
775;She gets to know the case, due to the sudden and inexcplicable death of her sister's daughter, and as she goes deeper and deeper into a case she considered a prank from the beginning, she understands that strange forces are at work.
776;And here is the big question mark.
777;It's a really clever, and deep movie, and unlike most movies, it requires from you to watch it carefully , because everything means something.
778;i believe we are talking about one of the year's best films!!!
779;the film works a high.
780;he created the Budweiser frogs.)
781;The Ring looks great, handling with equal aplomb the grim black.
782;I honestly marvel at the stuff that gets called horror, and for the longest time I was searching for horror movies that were actually scary, only to learn inevitably that there are very, very few.
783;here is the distinguishing difference: there are movies that scare you while you watch them, and there are movies that scare you after you watch them.
784;Your imagination (if you have one, which many people do not, and that is why they don't appreciate this film) will run wild with the imagery, sounds, and atmosphere The Ring creates, long after you have seen it.
785;there are plenty of problems with the film, many things that could have been done better in my opinion, but regardless there are some terrific moments in The Ring, and believe me when I say that you will create your own moments after you have seen it.
786;It definitely is on par with its Japanese predecessor Ringu, and really stands on its own.
787;This is some real psychological horror, and despite all its shortcomings, I love this film.
788;When i first saw this i thought it was pretty scary.
789;Now i just enjoy watching it.
790;It has an AMAZING story to it.
791;The Ring is based on the Japanese film ''Ringu'', and on the novel ''Ring'' by Koji Suzuki.
792;i have read the novel, and my personal favorite version of this story is the 1999 South Korean film adaptation called ''The Ring Virus''.
793;I love The Ring as well and it is pretty intense in some parts.
794;The Ring is the American version of a Japanese film called Ringu (or Ring, there seems to be some controversy over this for some reason), which was a huge hit pretty much everywhere in the world but the U. s., where it wasn't distributed.
795;The original film is a quiet, dark, creepy exercise in atmospheric horror, and it is quite effective.
796;The American version, while incorporating a scene or two from the excellent Japanese sequel, Ring 2, sticks fairly close to its source material, but is, as you might expect from a more expensive Hollywood remake, flashier, slicker, more special.
797;The filmmakers approached the material with at least a modicum of respect, and director Gore Verbinski seems to have a flair for the genre.
798;Still, overall the film is well done, although it just isn't as effective as I wanted it to be.
799;Very likely I'd have liked it somewhat better if I hadn't seen the original first.
800;In this film the enemy is more abstract.
801;As long as you impart certain information after the fact, then the video is rendered as harmless as the average chain letter.
802;Gore Verbinksi I thought did a wonderful job with visuals and it was a good story but it just needed to be spookier.
803;You should go and see The Ring just for the visuals.
804;Naomi Watts did a good job as the main character Rachel and I was surprised with the boys acting ability.
805;Decent acting, huh, rare for a horror movie.
806;'The Ring' is certainly a horror film, but it's mostly a moody, imagistic horror film, though it still does leap to life at the appropriate moments.
807;And, I think it's a great horror movie, and a great movie by any standard.
808;Just go in looking to see an interesting, well.
809;I'll admit it, this is one wacky plot.
810;the performances are strong, though there generally isn't a whole lot in the way of characterization.
811;Still, the strength of the film is in it's mood and images.
812;The tape itself is quite cool.
813;The whole film was blueified, but for once this technique actually works, and it isn't so overdone that the characters look alien.
814;The opening scene, depicting Katie's death, is a standard `victim wandering about the empty house' scene, but it works better than most, and is really quite intense.
815;There is also a powerful, frightening suicide scene and an inexplicable scene involving a horse going wild and killing itself.
816;And the final horror scene is quite effective, though I won't go into specifics.
817;Things they see in the tape are reflected in the real world, sometimes perhaps just a coincidence, other times suggesting an inevitability and lack of control on the part of the protagonists.
818;This is scary, I think, but it's mostly just cool.
819;The Ring is very well set up and I just love the camera work.
820;I don't want to give away the last part, but it's good and scary!
821;I thought it looked stupid, too, but it was pretty scary and has a good story.
822;This is recommended for AT LEAST one viewing.
823;Great movie and very scary although the Japanese version of it is even scarier.
824;The movie was prety much all I heard it was: Frightful!Yes I found it a bit slow at times but the supsense was great!
825;This scene alone is worth watching the film for.
826;The acting was great and the characters where people that I did care about.
827;It is scary and inteligent and this is more I can say for a some other movies out there.
828;Ah good old Doug from.
829;Hot there is it, it clearly has affected you.
830;firstly giving a fairly decent film 1 star, did you actually watch it?
831;Just stop watching intelligent movies and give those of us a break who can follow and enjoy a movie such as this.You only embarrass yourself.
832;It scared the heck out of me and it was a good story.
833;One of my favorite Scary movies!
834;Its very scary in a psychological way, its not cheesy or gory.
835;This little fright film houses some fine effects, gets you hooked into an almost implausible concept, and then sells out to sensationalism in the end.
836;But the cast of actors includes Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson as contemporary lovers who have a strangely sensitive son (well played by young David Dorfman), Jane Alexander at her usual fine state as a physician, and Brian Cox in yet another superb cameo.
837;The scenery is gorgeous (Seattle and surroundings) and the tricky camera work is excellent.
838;I saw this over a month ago and still the images pop in my head!
839;Rather, you are at the edge of your seat wondering how this story will continue to unfold as the mytery deepens.
840;The director makes excellent use of the natural surroundings to provide a dark, creepy backdrop enfolding this story.
841;totally engrossing, unnerving, horrying .
842;This is the scariest movie I have seen in probably the last 5 years.
843;It is also one of those great ones that you and a friend can talk about afterwards, trying to interpret the ending.
844;I found the American version far more believable based on this fact alone.
845;The extra film they advertise is actually deleted scenes cleverly spliced next to key scenes from the feature to make a little mini.
846;And after her sister begs her to research such occurences, Rachel is determined to find answers.
847;And that is exactly how everyone should see it.
848;watch The Ring at night alone while it's raining outside.
849;You'll regret it, but that's why it's so much fun.
850;anyway, this film is a very effective thriller, it does not use a lot of gore and blood, no twisted Clive Barkerish touches
851;This is a very good horror film, better than anything that has come out so far this year, except maybe Dog Soldiers .
852;lol it is a good movie but not as sracy as RINGU but it is a good jumpy/thiller movie!
853;Some possibilities should have been, Can You See the Lighthouse?
854;This movie was really intense from the very beginning and it only picked up from there.
855;At one point in the movie it just flashes the ring for a couple frames, which is amazing for psychological terror.
856;To sum it up, I really liked this movie and I thought it was very suspenseful and thrilling.
857;But if you want to see a truly nice psychological horror movie, go for SESSION 9 .
858;It IIIIIIIIIIIIIS haunting and it DOES have momemts of thrills and power.
859;But a classic it will never be.
860;It also bows to a couple of traditional horror.
861;movie contrivances, and that little Sixth Sense.
862;But what makes it so good, I think, is that it succeeds in spite of all that.
863;It's scary because it was so well.
864;made, and because the idea behind it is so powerful.
865;In the end, I thought the somehow stripped.
866;Rachel is a reporter for the Seattle Post, and the director does a good job of putting you into her place.
867;modern movie, but it suits.
868;overall fantasic acting, great character development, an intriguing and involving storyline, and some way scary moments.
869;linear, which is what good movie making should be all about.
870;She has the ability to thought.
871;project dark hallucinatory images, causing madness of an infectious scale.
872;But eventually Samara is murdered, dropped into a well, and her abilities become demonic.
873;Her residual imprint is captured in technology, her thoughts projected onto a simple video tape that provides her with a gateway into this world.
874;one thing that seems almost unsettling is the fact that Samara was, in life, a beautiful kid, despite the things that lurked behind her pale doll's face.
875;By opening the gateway, via the video tape, Samara is able to seek out her victims and just turn them into ruin.
876;It's a shadowy playground for the imagination, unlike with Fear Dot Com, which was an okay movie but made the mistake by showing you everything.
877;There's also a trailer for the Japanese movie, Ringu, which The Ring was based upon.
878;This is a great movie, but there were a few problems.
879;The entire movie is eerie, with some very disturbing images.
880;The ending is the most shocking (and scariest).
881;creepy, huh?Well, the movie starts out very well and I can certainly see where people thought this movie was very scary.
882;there are elements of horror to this film, but The Ring is really more of a mystery/suspense thriller than a pure horror film.
883;ultimately, The Ring is very much a psychological suspense thriller and you really have to pay very close attention to keep up with what is going on throughout the movie.
884;Also, the tape itself is very important as every single item or scene that you see in the tape has a specific meaning and is part of the puzzle that Rachael must put together in order to save herself and her son.
885;I think this investigation creates a building suspense in the audience as the movie moves towards its fantastic conclusion, but the essence of the film takes on a characterization of mystery/suspense rather than horror.
886;One final note: The Ring was based on a Japanese film called Ringu which I have not seen yet, but plan on doing so soon.
887;oh well, maybe, I will write a review about that movie as well.
888;I bought this movie thinking it was going to be excellent.
889;i bring up Kubrick to make a point.
890;and the twists that Verbinski adds to his work to Americanize it should give Ringu fans another perspective from which to view the characters.
891;And those little things added to the subtle ghost story that is The Ring.
892;upon watching the first scene, I was worried that this was going to be another teeny flick, but then I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the teeny.
893;and this is the real terror of the movie.
894;In fact, I was reminded in some scenes of the last great ghost story to grace the theaters.
895;This is an interesting cultural event.
896;Neither is the haunting in this remarkably innovative movie.
897;Verbinski's The Ring is an intelligent movie for an intelligent audience that will neither compare it mindlessly with its predecessor or need the actors to spoonfeed them the whole plot in direct dialogue.
898;Before you die, you see The Ring!
899;The Ring is a well.
900;The editing of this film is genius and is crucial to the atmosphere that the film creates.
901;This is a great horror film and will a great addition to my horror film library.
902;Not only is the director able to evoke an eerie atmosphere, but he manages to throw in the random thrills at unexpected moments, like when Rachel (Naomi Watts) is suddenly grabbed by Samara in the well.
903;Naomi Watts performance is superb, she really makes the scenes come alive and become realistic for the viewers, enhancing the already blood curling although over the top plot.
904;As each of the days pass by, the suspension is at an all high on the seventh day when Samara is finally given a proper burial.
905;overall I do give it a 4, but it goes up a notch more when you watch it at night.
906;The scariest movie I have never seen.
907;there are jumps and twists in this film, that are indeed frightening, but what I really like about the film is the originality of it.
908;the movie has an open ending and there is sequence movie.
909;from all the scary movies I have seen, this movie is the best.
910;this movie is so screwed up that it'll make you go under your covers with a flashlight and make you want your mommy.
911;the pacing is right, and the movie holds its audience hostage with an unshakeable dread the entire time.
912;as usual, Naomi Watts is excellent.
913;This was her first real role after her Oscar nomination.
914;worthy performance in Mulholland Drive.
915;Naomi is my favorite, but sometimes certain actors and actresses seem like they could fit better in certain roles than others
916;naomi does a good job here, and that's all that matters in the end.
917;the Ring was a commercial and critical success and put Naomi Watts's career on the steady rise.
918;I choose this rating because the movie is good.
919;What I like about the movie is that the Ring is the critically acclaimed, smash hit thriller David Ansen of Newsweek says raises some serious goosebumps!
920;This cinematic thrill ride will keep you on the edge of your seat from the stunning opening to the astonishing conclusion!
921;Now, the legend is coming true, the clock is ticking and Rachel has just seven days to unravel the mystery of The Ring.
922;What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it.
923;I would recommend this movie to other people.
924;The Ring was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen!
925;The plot is easy to understand and the twist at the end is very unpredictable.
926;I give it 5 stars.
927;superb actor, she can do (and has done) so much better than this (Mulholland Dr., anyone?)
928;0 suspense, 0 surprises, 0 credibility, and especially, 0 horror.
929;here are some recommendations for smart, interesting, intelligent, well.
930;*The Hills Have Eyes (Wes Craven): visionary and still shocking.
931;the original, not the ridiculous modern remake): the best and most frightening ghost story EVER, period.
932;This is an iconic and endlessly.
933;imitated masterpiece, right up there with George Romero's Night of the Living Dead.
934;Rosemary's Baby, also Polanski, is another winner and timeless classic.
935;Actually, ANYTHING Polanski is better than most of what's out there.
936;I liked this movie back when it came out.
937;I liked the fact that it didn't have to rely on a bunch of blood and gore to be creepy.
938;I never saw the original Ringu, so I'm not sure how good of an adaptation The Ring was, but thought that it was an excellent film from start to finish.
939;This movie is a cool film, always fun to watch, making you guess from start to finish.
940;when i was watching this movie, i thought it was a little like 'The Shining', an awesome Stanley Kubrick film.
941;Lined up to see everything, and staying still for god knows how long.
942;rated film of our time, 'Pirates of the Carribean'.
943;boys!So this movie has it's upsides, and it's downsides, so i gave it a score that was in the middle: 3!
944;I love a good thriller.
945;The director does a fantastic job of keeping the auidence on the tips of their toes.
946;What more can I say other than this was the scariest movie I have ever seen.
947;It is just that good.
948;With the story and directing filled with sharp twists and turns, The Ring turns out to be one of the best thrillers in the recent years.
949;The director, Gore Verbinski, makes the story move with such impressive camera movements and makes a visually stunning film.
950;She finds that the four kids, including her niece, that watched it, died seven days later.
951;Stumbling upon the tape in a mountain lodge, Rachel watches it herself and gets a call saying, Seven Days . . ..
952;The picture is superb and as clear as glass.
953;The sound is also top.
954;You think such a major box office hit would have more features to please its numerous fans.
955;great remake, they actually made it right.
956;in my opinion this is better than the original, props to verbinski.
957;loved every minute of iti recommend it.
958;You will see more subliminal images.
959;On a scale from 1 to 10 I would give it an 11.
960;Katie, a teenage girl, her boyfriend, and another young couple go away for a weekend in the woods of Washington State.
961;What they see is pure horror.
962;This film within a film is a surreal ominous vision of evil.
963;The suspenseful countdown begins, and tension builds excruciatingly, as more horrifying clues emerge.
964;director Gore Verbinski does a magnificent job of bringing Koji Suzuki's book, Ringu, vividly to the screen.
965;He knows the source of fear is in the mind.
966;With superb photography, camera shots of macabre images, and freeze frames, the film's ghostlike eeriness begins to work on the viewers mind, and pulse rate.
967;The psychology of this thriller is not based on blood and gore, but on a harrowing blend of the intense storyline, visual effects, and an excellent, but bizarre musical score that encourages feelings of dread.
968;the acting is very well done, with excellent performances by Ms. Watts, who is not a screamer, but a level.
969;headed investigator, with a human capacity for fear
970;done movie to rate it 5 stars!
971;I absolutely loved this movie!
972;has she young girl returned to seek her revenge?The visual style of The Ring is arguably its greatest asset.
973;Imagery is both creepy and alluring, with the film's dark color palette adding to the cold, wet climate of The Pacific Northwest.
974;While certain aspects of the film are a bit far fetched or not fully developed, The Ring stands out as one of the better psychological horror films in recent memory, aided by a unique story, strong performances and haunting visuals.
975;And there's no big shocks until the very end.Yet it's still one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.Yes, The Ring is one of those rare gems that keeps the suspense and intensity going throughout the film.
976;the acting is good in this movie, although the only person you've probably heard of is Naomi Watts, who plays a newspaper reporter who's niece viewed the tape and died seven days later.
977;She of course views the tape, then gets a chilling phone call that says seven days.
978;boyfriend assists in the endeavor, just slightly lightening the mood at times.
979;You sort of create a lot of your own fear here, because you almost always expect something bad to happen every time a character makes a move.
980;That adds to the tension and is one of the reasons why I liked this film so much.
981;Finding out more about the legend of the tape and getting to see it, uncut, for yourself is a great bonus.
982;And, like me when I saw the movie in theaters, you'll have a nerve.
983;wracking week after you see this, wondering if the legend is really true.
984;this movie was one of the most well done pieces of film i've ever had the pleasure of watching.
985;but this one managed to spook me a little, so that speaks volumes for the type of atmosphere this movie brought.
986;The Ring is still one of my favorite horror movies.
987;I don't think most movies are creepy anymore, but this one definitely holds up.
988;This was a classic movie by todays standards and although was not the least bit scary, it is still a great mystery movie that utilizes a bit of horror into it as well.
989;The Ring was an interesting mix of urban legend, psychological thriller, and rip.
990;I loved it!Director Gore Verbinski did an excellent job with a cast that we would not usually recognize.
991;The horror of The Ring is the suspense.
992;After viewing the film, you may have a hard time deciding to view segments with such warnings, but they were well worth it.
993;One is a trailer for the original film, Ringu, which The Ring was based on.
994;Furthermore, young Daveigh Chase won an MTV Movie Award for being the scariest villain and you will see why.
995;The Ring is an impressive film.
996;but that was a brilliant ruse by the director.
997;The movie's imagery is chilling without being juvenile.
998;It can be enjoyed on many levels.yes, it's a horror film, but it's also making some profound statements about the viral nature of stories that race through our mass media, poisoning our society.
999;The viral aspect of The Ring (you watch the tape and you are marked for death unless you show it to someone else) is frickin' brilliant.
1000;And the surface alone is quite a slick, edge.
1001;This is such a great, suspenseful, well.
1002;thought out piece that I had to watch it twice.
1003;This movie is great for those who enjoy a movie with a ton of jumpy moments.
1004;The Ring is a modern gothic masterpiece that is genuinely horrifying and creepy.
1005;naomi Watts is great as the beautiful, young journalist who is investigating the strange VHS tape that has killed her niece and everyone else who has watched it.
1006;She scrambles to uncover its secrets before her and her son become the next victims.
1007;The Ring is a good, clean scare that will continue to chill you long after the television is turned off.
1008;Seriously, just the eerie, surrealistic footage in the video (which reminded me of the Bunuel masterpiece,The Andalusian Dog) is worth the price of admission.
1009;My favorite movie when I was 6 was the movie Poltergeist.
1010;The Ring has a great way of making a viewer afraid of common household appliances like the phone, the TV, the VCR.
1011;Just when you think you know what direction the movie is about to go in, it surprises you again.
1012;The Ring is also filled with many disturbing visual surprises and even the editing is unique compared to most scary movies.
1013;Many of the images will haunt you long after you see the movie.
1014;i also highly recommend seeing the original Japanese version of the movie called Ringu.
1015;It is much more subtle than the American version, but I think I respect it more for that reason.
1016;Still, it is tough to decide who is scarier, Sadako or Samara, but both are wonderfully frightening in their own way.
1017;Just trust me on this and watch this movie!
1018;I love horror movies, especially supernatural ones.
1019;This one got me hooked from the beginning and kept my interest all the way through.
1020;It made me appreciate this one so much more.
1021;He knows the meaning of atmosphere, and he can be very versatile in his tone.
1022;His work in Pirates of the Carribean was delightfully fun, and here, he steeps the movie in a constant sense of dread.
1023;Meanwhile, he's great with the BOO moments, the most notable being the infamous girl in the closet.
1024;He's quite good with the whole imagery thing, using his stylish approach to make the audience remember what they saw.
1025;Most great horror movies have some underlying point to them.
1026;The Shining toyed with madness and inevitability.
1027;Many Hitchcock movies rely not on a central principle, but on the best suspense you'll ever see, like Psycho or The Birds.
1028;That's the only thing that is accomplished in the movie.
1029;in short, the movie is great the first time through, because the jumps moments are new, and the atmosphere is fantastic.
1030;at 2 in the morning would be good.
1031;i thought this movie ranks up there with The Exorcist and Psycho.
1032;Of course, I also know people that thought The Exorcist was campy and good for a laugh.
1033;Certainly the shock of a good movie that I just happened across always makes a good movie that much better but, in the end, you have to praise a good movie for just being good.
1034;folks, this is a top ten classic horror flick.
1035;The Ring is an American adaptation of the 1998 Japanese horror film called Ringu.
1036;If this sounds like an urban legend to you, you're right on the money.
1037;After some playful hijinks, we discover that Katie really did see the tape as we catch a quick glimpse of her final moments of life.
1038;Moreover, the images Rachel saw on the tape continue to turn up during her investigations.
1039;I for one welcome these fresh attempts to deepen the horror genre.
1040;Gory exploitation films and teenage stalker movies certainly have a place (consider how Jason, Freddy, and Michael Myers are now a permanent part of our pop culture), but for those of us who want something deeper and darker to strike us insensate, The Ring delivers the goods.
1041;Included on the version I watched was a trailer for the original Ringu and deleted scenes that provide additional information about the mysteries of the film, including a chilling alternate ending.
1042;Sequels often do serious damage to the original picture, but if more films take us deeper into the mysterious realm that is Samara, I welcome them with open arms.
1043;Also, the images on the tape continue to turn up during the investigation.
1044;The ending is by far the highlight of the film.
1045;If you're a fan of psychological terror over blood and guts, then The Ring is a perfect movie for you.
1046;Ignore the Amazon Editorial on this film, this one's a winner!
1047;I was incredibly impressed with The Ring.
1048;factor, it ranks up there among the best horror films I've ever seen.
1049;This is one of the rare films that actually gave me goosebumps!
1050;This film is just crackles with a creepy intensity.
1051;I've watched it three times and I've learned more and more each time I've watched it.
1052;I promise you that you will never look at your television the same way again. . .
1053;As she investigates, she quickly comes to realize that there is truly something special about this tape and that the clock is ticking.
1054;Superb acting, fast plot advancement and great plot twists make this an enjoyable movie for a cold, dark night.
1055;I loved this movie it had like three parts that made me jump and like 2 parts that made me scream this movie i sgreat becuase when you think its over your just in the middle of the mystery this movie rocks Oh bye the way if u loved this movie.
1056;It looks great, it sounds great, but it's not great.
1057;The effects are nice .
1058;This kind of convention has been done before, and far better, in movies like The Changeling.
1059;i do believe this is the scariest movie ever made, at least that I have seen, and I challenge people to find a scarier movie than this.
1060;it's the American version of the Japanese Ringu made in 1998.
1061;She finds out where to find the tape and brings it home with her to watch it.
1062;i've seen a LOT of scary movies, but this one definitely rates as one of the top five!It's a MUST SEE!
1063;The Ring is definitely one of those kinds of movies.
1064;a brief summary of the plot is easy to do.
1065;You watch it, then the phone rings, and then a spooky voice tells you that you have seven days to live.
1066;Everytime you think your getting closer to figuring out what the deal with the videotape is, something happens and some of it is truly unnerving (ie.
1067;I LOVE This movie and i will always love this movie!!!
1068;i think thay did a really good job with this movie i think Samara is cool and is a girl that i think that we can all like.
1069;so anyways i really like this movie so 5 stars!
1070;I have always loved the Ring Series.
1071;This movie will be sure to have you clinging to the edge of your seat or buried in the arms of your partner.
1072;Can she do it in time?Overall this movie easily deserves five stars and I wish I could give it more!
1073;I highly recommend watching this movie and if you watch it at night in the dark it really adds to it.
1074;For example, there is always that child who knows too much and is ridiculously smart.
1075;i mean those movies actually kept you on the edge of your seat.
1076;They actually captured suspense, unlike these pg.13 teen flicks.
1077;i love this movie, it scared the be.
1078;This scared the hell out of me when I first saw it but that was the best part about it and this is a great horror movie.
1079;Theres nothing else to say but that this is a fantastic scary movie and the best scary movies in years I rcommend it to everyone who likes real horror flicks.
1080;it's A top winner and better then the book and better then The Ring Two.
1081;Scary buffs it's a Must See and have.
1082;See for yourself I saw it alone one night.
1083;Now I'll see it again with a friend early in the evening like 4pm.
1084;For several years friends have been telling me I just NEED to see the movie The Ring.
1085;It's subtle, well written, and got my skin crawling in a way I've haven't felt in a long time.
1086;One thing to note about this movie is that it is more of a suspense thriller than horror.
1087;It was also quite good.
1088;When she answers it she hears a voice say, Seven days.
1089;Instead, this is a fairly intelligent and well done thriller regarding an investigation into a mysterious videotape.
1090;It is one of the better films that I have seen in the genre.
1091;The American remake of Hideo Nakata's brilliant masterpiece, Ring(u), is like a very good episode of X. files, but it can't touch the visionary genius of the original picture.
1092;Performances in The Ring are good .
1093;A disturbing thrilling movie to say the least
1094;From the disturbing scenes to the twisted plot it makes for a great horror movie.
1095;Naomi Watts (whose extremely hot by the way) does a great job as the lead.
1096;It's heartening that effective suspense and horror can still come out of Hollywood in this era of Scream, Scary Movie, and the remnants of moronic teen fair [Freddy vs Jason].
1097;She watches the tape as does her sensitive son and the boys estranged father.
1098;She is told by the mysterious phone call that she now has 7 days to live.
1099;The protagonists start their research on the NET, move to moldy public library sources, and ultimately to insane asylum records.
1100;Eventually, the drama reaches its conclusion with additional jumps and starts all the way through.
1101;Very effective, brilliantly creepy film.
1102;The remake to the hit Japenese film Ringu delivers more than a few shocks and scares.
1103;If you love to be scared than this movie is just what you need.
1104;It's a good story, spooky, suspenseful, dark, and gloomy.
1105;I think the best thing this movie has going for it is the atmosphere.
1106;I think this creates a consistent spooky atmosphere.
1107;The other thing this movie has going for it is that it's scary and suspenseful most of the time.
1108;She's perfect in her role.
1109;the music by Hans Zimmer is highly effective and fits in with what is on the screen.
1110;Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.
1111;overall, this is a pretty good flick that I rate at 3 1/2 stars.
1112;The Ring is a scary and entraining film.
1113;the story in this film is scary and creative like the original film, Ringu.
1114;This film is a bit more graphic, and louder.
1115;The acting was great, and I enjoyed the film's cinematography.
1116;wise, this is definitely the definitive version.
1117;overall, The Ring is a frightening film that builds upon what the original created
1118;Two people I watched it with had seen it in the theatre.
1119;Also fun to see is a short trailer to the original Japanese horror film, Ringu, of which The Ring is the American remake.
1120;She's great to watch here.
1121;The Ring is a decent Americanized verison of the Japanese horror film Ringu .
1122;While it removes things that American audiences may have trouble understanding or accepting (i. e. the boy's father is somewhat psychic, and this is never addressed as being odd), it adds some interesting twists and features (i. e. the horses).
1123;Otherwise, The Ring is a decent scary filck.
1124;Based upon a Japanese horror film, The Ring is an extremely well.
1125;made example of a psychologically harrowing movie.
1126;Her investigation is aided by her friend and father of her child, Noah, played by Martin Henderson.
1127;a big part of why The Ring works so well is the exceptional performance of Naomi Watts.
1128;She commits fully to the character of Rachel, infusing her with depth and complexity.
1129;This makes the film's story much easier to believe, since Watts is so convincing.
1130;Martin Henderson, previously seen in the Indie comedy The Opposite of Sex, is solid as Noah, and Brian Cox is chilling in the supporting role of Robert Morgan.
1131;The Ring is a movie that I recommend watching alone late at night with all the lights out.
1132;The Ring, the movie that has scared almost everyone who has seen it.
1133;Gore Verbinski's direction was very effective.
1134;His use of mixing subtle blues and blacks fit the films mood, and enhanced my mood while watching it.
1135;Naomi Watts succeeds at her character for I was involved thoroughly with it throughout the entire movie.
1136;This is an American version of a Japanese film based upon a comic.
1137;If you watch it you will get a phone call and be told you will die in seven days.
1138;There is definitely something strange going on.
1139;She watches it before believing it.
1140;She starts to become frantic with trying to find a way to break the curse and that means learning more about it.
1141;Her son seems to have some connection to the video and its images and it somehow revolves around a young girl.
1142;I found this film to be far better than I had thought it would be.
1143;A pretty good and creepy film.
1144;I was able to watch horror movies for years and years without being affected really.
1145;Well I got a lot more than I wished for all right!!!
1146;anyway, The Ring is as good a horror movie you'll ever come across.
1147;It succeeds in being both highly entertaining and genuinely frightening at the same time.
1148;The imagery in the film is great.
1149;it's really shocking how something so simple can play with your mind for so long.
1150;I also liked the colour in which the film was shot in.
1151;Considering this is a remake it has been highly successful and The Ring as a film proves that you don't need large doses of violence to create a decent horror flick.
1152;This movie is a cinematic masterpiece, and is, without any doubt, much better than the garbage directors try to pass off as horror movies today.
1153;S C A R Y !
1154;A must see (if you dare).
1155;The Ring is much more.
1156;The Ring makes us consider their validity.
1157;Aiden is definitely attuned to the other world.
1158;secondly, Rachal is bound to the story through her research.
1159;One by one she peels off the layers of this gothic mystery/puzzle/freakshow.
1160;At the beginning she is frankly beautiful, cool and assured.
1161;As revelations unfold and she begins to experience frisson, she begins a shift in appearance, becoming rumpled.
1162;The Ring is definitely a cerebral experience in terror.
1163;sPOILER ALERT:One of those fast flashes of film reveals this: Live birth.
1164;An intriguing bit of information that many viewers and reviewers missed or I misinterpreted.
1165;Please read his for a great overview of this haunting film.
1166;This is, by far, THEEEEE scariest movie in my lifetime.
1167;Better than 'The Exorsist' by far (no question about it!!!)
1168;You take this fear home with you after you watch it.
1169;To its credit, The Ring gets your attention from the start.
1170;It is well filmed and well acted, with dialogue that never seems too out of the ordinary.
1171;The creepy imagery is something that might linger after viewing the film.
1172;Some days ago, I saw the movie, The Ring, with my friends.
1173;She asked help to her ex.
1174;He needed to watch the same tape and also got a call.
1175;The wired tape was recording by the psychometric power of a girl who killed by mother.
1176;Other friends said they could tell it is a nice movie.
1177;It will be a good example about the perspective of media effects to us.
1178;My friends who watched movie with me copied things from the movie and got happy from the making others scary when they went to their dormitory.
1179;And that will be what filmmakers want to audiences because it will be one of good advertising for the movie.
1180;my result is, in modern society, media does great effect to many people.
1181;I'd love to do a national survey and ask people what they found scary about htis.
1182;I agree with what seems to be the general sentiment in that you should watch this more than once to catch everything and truly appreciate it.
1183;stellar performance from Naomi Watts.
1184;This was her first movie in which she played the main character, and she carries that weight very well.
1185;Martin Henderson was good, too, as the more laid.
1186;THis is probably the most over rated movie I've seen in the last several years, with the possible exception of The Aviator.
1187;The movie begins with a creepy vibe and you think, yea, this is gonna be a good one.
1188;There are several unneeded scenes in which the movie is able to add a little bit of gore to it (the flash of Katie in the closest, the horse falling off the boat, and the RIDICULOUS way in which Samara's father kills himself) but honestly!
1189;The constant watery look definatly adds to the feeling of it and the music will give you chills.
1190;subtle stinker 3 for the lovely cinematics.
1191;stopper, the story twists and turns and confuses and leaves you desperate for a great ending.
1192;The Ring is one of my all time favorite classical music pieces.
1193;I was happy to hear that they were releasing a movie of that.
1194;when I first did this review, I didn't see the movie but now I have and I'll have to say it was a pretty good movie.
1195;Very good movie, but it still get's one start because it's not Wagner.
1196;Technically, it is quite impressive.
1197;it should merely be felt, since film is such a visual medium anyway (leave explanations to writers, hehe).
1198;Those are really great horror/science fiction movies.
1199;and i think the ring is the best of the three.
1200;after you see it a couple of times scenes, images, little things said and not said, this is one of the best horror films of all time.
1201;the scene with sadako walking from the well is one of the creepiest scenes i've ever seen.
1202;this is an intelligent horror movie.
1203;When I saw The Ring at my local theater last fall was impressed enough by its wonderfully creeped.
1204;Having watched it last night though I felt a bit disappointed.Yes, the film still holds its impact on the small screen.
1205;certainly it wouldn't be the first time.
1206;The Ring is actually a pretty faithful remake of Hideo Nakata's 1998 thriller Ringu.
1207;conscious fans may wait until The Ring 2.
1208;ok, the acting is pretty good and the direction, cinematography is not too bad.
1209;I can give you my suspension of disbelief and it actually keeps me somewhat entertained anticipating what might happen to the beautiful Naomi Watts.
1210;tape on the net and the spirit would really be happy killing billions of people.
1211;I bet that's what they are cooking up at the movie studio right now for the sequel.
1212;Then the movie was looked into and discovered that it was one small seizure and so the film was brought back to the box office.
1213;This used special effects, like actually the part of the girl coming out of the television was actually her tearing though a large horizontal piece of green paper.
1214;Mark Leeper feels that all of these roles were played extremely well and that all of the characters were brought out to life thanks to the cast.
1215;Everyone's role involved so much practicing, like getting the perfect facial expressions and saying their lines with enough emotion and enthusiasm.
1216;in conclusion, the film The Ring to me was outstanding.
1217;The author of the review, I feel, did a good job commenting the movies acting, because I agreed with all of the remarks that Leeper had said in the review.
1218;Mark Leeper gives The Ring a two thumbs up but I would give it more than two if I had more than two thumbs.
1219;She's the aunt of the opening scene's victim.
1220;She comes across the tape and watches it, and learns that she has seven days left.
1221;this part was actually intriguing to me, because I thought the movie was going to break free of the horror movie cliches it was in danger of getting bogged down into.
1222;At this point it's more of a thriller
1223;in fact, I kind of liked it and thought that after it was established that yes, this was the way things were REALLY going to work out, the movie would have ended on a stronger note without any explanation.
1224;Ironically, however, this movie did not live up to my expectations, but I still gave it a five because of how successfully the actors are able to drive the storyline forward.
1225;type of feeling is what really kept the whole fear factor into it, and that's what is really remarkable about it.
1226;I'm not the type of person who gets scared easily so I'm assuming this is a really good thing going for the movie)!
1227;Unlike most people I know, I really enjoyed the entire fear factor of it all and especially the disturbing images of the little girl walking out of the well.
1228;like atmosphere associated with it, more of a suspenseful type.
1229;that said, this was an excellent horror movie.
1230;This is a tale of two mothers and two children.
1231;Cute, funny and bursting with health teen Katie tells a friend about a weird tape she watched.
1232;Katie and her friend laugh it off and then in a terrifying scene Katie dies.
1233;Enter, Naomi Watts as Katie's aunt Rachel.
1234;she discovers the Morgans a once happy couple who adopted a baby girl named Samara.
1235;there are three perfect scenes in this movie.
1236;the Ring is a chilling movie and it will make you look twice at your TV set.
1237;Naomi Watts does a fine job.
1238;Instead of implying it the audience should've been able to see her take the needed action.
1239;Otherwise this was a truly terrific film.
1240;There are parts in this movie that are wonderful
1241;The atmosphere created by the cinematography is absolutely chilling.
1242;The way the story is told, in the day.
1243;In the original, the story makes more sense.
1244;i strongly recommend seeing Ringu .
1245;It's more subtle and more interesting.
1246;It is sound and creative film.
1247;This was easily one of the scariest movies ever made!
1248;It engrosses you and pulls you in so much so that it feels almost real.
1249;It is a mystery, suspense and horror film all rolled into one.
1250;The plot is fresh and original and has never been done before with the exception of the original Japanese film Ringu that inspired this American version, which is far creepier and scarier than the Japanese version.
1251;This is one of the things that makes it so good
1252;This is the scariest movie I've seen in over ten years, and I've seen almost all of the horror movies out there!
1253;If you're looking for a fresh and frightening movie watch The Ring in the dark.
1254;And be well aware that you may not be alive in another week!
1255;If you saw this movie first, you very well might.
1256;Scary, mysterious, and engrossing, The Ring succeeds because it eschews so many staples of modern horror (nudity and wanton sex, gratuitous gore, killers who can't stop spouting one.
1257;Tautly written and seamlessly directed with a standout performance by charismatic Naomi Watts as the benighted lead, The Ring is everything most horror films are not.
1258;It is not only terrifying, but their is actually a great story line full of suspense.
1259;I recommend every one to see this film.
1260;It has a staunch fan base while its commercial success spawned American remakes of Ju.
1261;These aren't slasher flicks
1262;The Ring and The Grudge continue to be the best of the bunch.
1263;mother and journalist Rachel, played by Naomi Watts in her breakthrough role, investigates a strange video tape.
1264;well noted for its outstanding, spooky imagery and Rick Baker's masterful effects, The Ring looks fantastic on Blu.
1265;Images are sharp and well defined
1266;This is a First Class show all the way.
1267;bonus features entertain and enlighten and are carried over from previous releases.
1268;What makes a great ghost story is history.
1269;The most effective device in this film was the use of sound.
1270;Rarely have I encountered a film in which the sound acts like a character.
1271;Naomi Watts is one of our best actresses whose roles range from the bizarre (MULHOLLAND DRIVE) to the sublime (THE RING, 21 GRAMS).
1272;I recommend that you do not watch this alone (even though I did).
1273;Leaves you on the edge of your seat!
1274;it stops rather abruptly and that's it.
1275;The second thing one will notice throughout the film is that it's not so much a horror flick as it is a pleasantly surprising, thrilling and suspenseful suspense/thriller.
1276;of surprise as well are the relative newcomers who star in this film, Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson.
1277;Needless to say, I'm sure their stock has gone up considerably due to the success of this film.
1278;Director Gore Verbinski deserves copious accolades for bringing this great film to the silver screen and the home theater!
1279;one of those teenagers that ends up dead at the beginning of the movie has an aunt who also happens to be a reporter, in comes the oh so gorgeous Naomi Watts as Aunt Rachel.
1280;Rachel's sister entreats her into finding out what happened to her daughter and she takes on the task!
1281;what follows from there is as stated above, one of the best and most intriguing suspense/thrillers of 2002!
1282;I highly recommend this movie as I'm sure you will be pleasantly surprised as well!
1283;It was just a great roller coaster of a movie.
1284;And the fact that it doesnt try to explain WHY was ingenious.
1285;wow it really got to me.
1286;The ring is the most original psychological thriller/horror movie in years.
1287;I have been watching horror movies since i was 9 or 10 and thaught most of the hollywood ones were funny in a way rather than dusturbing.
1288;I believe that this is not just the best scary movie of 2002, but one of the best 2002 movies.
1289;The beginning of this movie had me soooo excited!
1290;I was thinking that finally here was a scary movie that had something good going.
1291;A scary movie that actually was scary.
1292;then at the end I got excited again, thinking.
1293;Now maybe everything will come together and make some sense.
1294;The movie is okay I guess.
1295;in my opinion, THE RING is an interesting movie, i enjoyed watching it and i think you should watch it and judge it for yourself before your read the other reviews about it.
1296;the movie is a great horror movie, that keeps you in suspens thruogh all it.
1297;it wasn't even a good movie.
1298;Gore Verbinski has created a great spine.
1299;Bojan Bazelli's cinematography is also excellent, as this is a visually handsome film.
1300;Naomi Watts does a good job as Rachel Keller working her way through this mystery.
1301;Brian Cox does a good job as Richard Morgan who is so distraught that he electrocutes himself.
1302;(Since he won't be back for R2
1303;Amber Tamblyn from the Joan of Arcadia series on TV does a brief but good job at the beginning of the film as the frightened teen.
1304;Ehren Kruger, whose Arlington Road screenplay was very good, does a good job in building the suspense.
1305;Jane Alexander is always excellent, but I had to strain to see her with grey hair!
1306;The scene on the ferry with the horse was thoroughly engrossing.
1307;It is a combination of suspense and thriller.
1308;The evil in the little girl is so intense, so radiating that it makes me shudder just thinking about her.
1309;In this fantastic masterpiece, there are many jump scenes.
1310;The music is so eerie it makes you sit in your seat and widen your eyes with shock and with suspense of what the next moment might bring.
1311;The Ring is as unpredictable as you can get .
1312;The cast consists of some known actors, however, most of them are relatively unknown.
1313;They create an atmosphere so tense you could cut it with a knife.
1314;They co. star together so beautifully you can't help but think you are really in the movie with them.
1315;everything about this movie is really good and it is the creepiest movie i have seen in a really long time!
1316;basicaly this film has to be one of the best modern horror/suspence films that I have seen for a very long time.
1317;this truely is a woork of art and will likely cause you to have many sleepless nights.
1318;I bought it, I watched it, and I did not understand.
1319;ok, it's a little scary, it has nice cinematograghy(!)
1320;, and an attractive main character.
1321;Nice to watch, but leaves you at closing time with the feeling that you need a whole lot more.
1322;As I wasn't able to get my hands on a Japanese version(Which I saw later) and was highly anticipating seeing this after hearing great things about the Japanese one.
1323;I think the Japanese one is more admirable, where this one seems more human and relatable.
1324;Though keep in mind I have a highly over.
1325;But I thought this was probably one of the best to come out of the Hollywood machine in years(Then again since most of their movies suck, how much is that really saying.)
1326;But seriously for me it was absolutely frightening.
1327;And has a feeling of impending doom.
1328;Plus the acting is good.
1329;I think that Gore Verbinski handled this movie very well.
1330;The thing is to come in with an open mind and watch it alone in a dark room in the late.
1331;And see if it effects you then.
1332;'The Ring' is certainly effective at setting a chilling mood, especially if you watch it with the lights out.
1333;The problem is you have to really let go of logic and sensibilities to thoroughly enjoy it.
1334;The original Japanese film 'Ringu' wasn't any better, and I usually always prefer an original foreign piece to its American copy.
1335;if you want to share a thriller of a movie with your kids (my boys are 9 and 12), this is the one to see.
1336;This movie is really good.
1337;At the beginning its kind of scary but ones you get the hang of it you will probably start liking it.
1338;I really enjoyed it I had fun watching it several of times.
1339;This has to be the most inspired story ever.
1340;Daviegh Chase is the most talented actor playing a killer in the history of horror.
1341;watch the movie, you'll notice that they actually included some funny scenes and jokes in there to keep everybody happy.
1342;i really recommend this to anyone who wants to be scared, or just enjoy an atmospheric, inspired piece of film.
1343;The Ring is an American remake of the 1998 Japanese hit Ringu, based on Koji Suzuki's popular novel.
1344;Naomi Watts, (who could pass for Nicole Kidman's sister), is an outstanding actress and plays her role excellently.
1345;A truly scary movie confuses you and chills you with the unexpected, the unknown, and occasionally, the incomprehensible.
1346;The Ring gives you all this and more.
1347;this film continues a recent trend in horror movies of taking place in a setting we all know, that likely exists in our own home.
1348;We have a comfortable familiarity with electronics, safe and snug with the doors locked.
1349;We discover, with Rachel and Aidan in a journey that fits all the pieces together, that every image in the movie has meaning.
1350;this movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen and the best I've seen recently.
1351;I enjoyed how all the elements of the movie were tied together for those with the diligence to keep track of imagery throughout.
1352;I wanted this movie because I like paule on tv and this was a movie that she is in nice.
1353;They're just great entertainment to me, which is why I really like this one.
1354;It was scary and they did a good job making a, what seemed like a corny subject, turn out to be pretty interesting.
1355;I'm a HUGE fan of the horror genre, and The Ring has to be one of the best horror movies ever made.
1356;anyway, I highly recommend this movie.
1357;It has the scares, some (but not much) humor, and a gorgeous leading character (Ms Watts).
1358;The visuals are fascinating and the story grips you right from the start.
1359;This movie takes time to fully understand, but unlike some people I think this adds to the movie's success.
1360;may be you'll enjoy it, I didn't.
1361;As a fan of X. files, I love anything that puts me on the edge of my seat.
1362;I have always been a great fan of Japanese movies and anime, because they rely on the power of the unspoken.
1363;They still have plots that reveal in a subtle, yet chilling way.
1364;This art is lostt in Hollywood.
1365;scenes, but the lack of those things is what makes Ringu good, you morons!
1366;It's the power of the unspoken, the imagination.
1367;ringu is intellectual horror, subtle and chilling, with a good plot, and scary because it leaves things to the imagination.
1368;Just to set an example of the fact that Western culture wants everything done their way, and totally screw it up in the process.
1369;Naomi Watts throws in a stellar performance.
1370;The story line is about when this reporters niece dies of watching this tape, She then finds the tape and watches it, She gets a phone call saying 7 days.
1371;She found the well under the cabin.
1372;it left on a cliff hanger which i thought was very good.
1373;The Ring (2002) is an interesting American horror remake based on the Japanese film Ringu (1998).
1374;Although there were a lot of holes in the plot that are never tied up or explained (which I'll discuss shortly), overall, I really enjoyed this film.
1375;It's actually a mystery wrapped in a horror/thriller film, and there's even a brief film within the film which is a big part of the plot, and is actually one of the scariest and creepiest things in the whole movie, and whose haunting, creepy, and disturbing images will stay with you for a long time.
1376;those points aside, if you just ignore those problems and just go with the flow and let the movie's haunting, mysterious, creepy, and well.
1377;done visuals and images carry you along, you'll probably enjoy it like I did, and all in all, this is one of the scariest and most suspenseful movies I've seen in a long time.
1378;The performances of the cast are excellent and the movie is visually stunning.
1379;The Ring is a scary film with good acting and dialogue and a chilling score by Hans Zimmer.
1380;The anamorphic widescreen picture is excellent.
1381;Having seen both the Japanese and US films, I can honestly say that both are worth seeing.
1382;One learns as much from the differences as you do from the similarities.
1383;This is still one of the best horror movies ever made.
1384;That movie is less scary and less visual (gorry) but it made sense and had a great plot!
1385;The Ring (unlike its inferior sequel) is a complex, mysterious movie with a deep backstory.
1386;The Ring's fascinating yet mysterious story spawned many websites and web forums simply devoted to unraveling its mysteries.
1387;Though the movie is meant to be interpretive and many create their own explanations to many of the mysteries, here are the ones generally agreed upon by The Ring aficionados.
1388;Much of this information is taken from Ring websites and forums.
1389;This is what is generaly known as PHOTOKINESIS (the telekinetic ability to create, control, and manipulate light and energy).
1390;She may have had Hydrokinesis (the ability to manipulate water) and she also seems to have Pyrokinesis (the ability to manipulate fire) .
1391;(Its interesting to note that Richard may have also been there helping since its unlikely Anna had the strength to move the stone lid over the well by herself).
1392;There are two interesting ones of note.
1393;Her spirit haunts that place down in the well.
1394;the TapeThe images on the tape are a combination of dream imagery and symbols that representing some aspects of Samara's life, her suffering and death, and the nightmare images she likes to come up with.
1395;Take this with you next time you watch the movie, 
1396;This is without doubt the most intelligent horror movie I have seen in years.
1397;There was a time when horror films were fun, scary, and exciting.
1398;just in time for Halloween, a handful of horror films were released.
1399;Amongst them was The Ring, an American remake of a 1998 Japanese hit, adapted by Arlington Road and Scream 3 scribe Ehren Kruger.
1400;Here is a fine example of a modern horror film that actually thrills, and proof that strong word of mouth can greatly benefit a good film not expected to do as well.
1401;Not only is this one of the best horror films ever made, it is also one of the few remakes that actually fare better than the original.
1402;The Ring is a surprisingly effective and subtle horror film that, through genuine wit and intelligence, stands out amongst the computer.
1403;affirming style of horror typified by The Sixth Sense and its many imitations.
1404;The Ring sets up its central premise with admirable speed and clarity.
1405;The premise is beautifully set up in a simple opening scene that uses a ringing telephone and the image of a static.
1406;pounding musical score, to whip up a sudden crescendo of tension.
1407;director Gore Verbinski's (The Mexican) visualization of what is on that tape has to be counted as one of the film's major triumphs.
1408;this is the rare Hollywood horror film that actually respects its audience's intelligence enough not to have its heroine freaked out by finding a stray cat wandering around the pantry.
1409;center vision of a world that is recognizably our own.
1410;He has the patience to create a subtle atmosphere that prays not on our immediate impulses, but on the usually hidden fears that lurk within us all.
1411;Verbinski understands that the camera creates tension just by moving
1412;The look of fear so clearly expressed by his characters is always more chilling than any monster he might turn his camera on.
1413;Perhaps Verbinski's greatest accomplishment is when the film's main horror finally does make itself visible after dominating the viewer's imagination, it still manages to be as frightening as anything we could have visualized in our mind's eye.
1414;In a time when so many horror films tend to present women as either cute survivors or victims born only to be exploited and punished, Watts gives us a recognizable human being who, though understandably terrified, displays welcome strength and determination, giving the film a needed boost of reality.
1415;The Ring is a handsomely mounted, intelligently crafted thriller that skillfully maintains a tense sense of dread.
1416;verbinski and company have crafted an exemplary thriller, and maybe one of the year's best films.
1417;The Ring is a true masterpiece of modern horror, which is wonderful considering Hollywood hasn't pumped out any consistently good edge.
1418;seat films in quite some time.
1419;Maybe The Ring will help change this.
1420;As a horror movie, The Ring, which is remake of a popular Japanese film of the same name, is very easy on the eyes.
1421;The photography, dark and brooding, is outstanding.
1422;And the female talent .
1423;are both delicious to watch.
1424;the acting in the film is first rate
1425;Watching this feature reminded me of a Dean Koontz novel.
1426;The visuals are only mildly gruesome
1427;i'm not usually into horror flicks, but I enjoyed this film immensely.
1428;Naomi Watts puts on a sterling performance.
1429;I saw it in cinema, and honestly, first I doubt if I would like it.
1430;When it begin with a teenager murdered, I liked to think it as SCREAM type of movie.
1431;The figure of the creature, suprisingly, is very very Asian banshee style.
1432;White clothes, long hair, black eyes and skinny.
1433;two thumbs up to this idea.
1434;I like it, better than other holywood horror.
1435;Yeah, I think that the best part of this movie.
1436;John Carpenter's mood masterpiece The Thing is released upon the movie going public.
1437;It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest horror films ever released.
1438;There's something about an infertile mother and diseased horses.
1439;The best movie since The Exorcist!!!
1440;maybe they mean Exorcist II: The Heretic, but The Exorcist I watched was a landmark movie which was actually scary and at the same time, made perfect sense.
1441;It also presented a great question about human psychology throughout the ages and about what we MIGHT be capable of with that 90% of our brains which we never use, or what evils we might be susceptible to.
1442;The Ring presents you with nothing.
1443;He clearly believes that audiences won't know the difference between a plot that has a narrative, sequential story, and a movie like the Ring that has no plot.
1444;I jumped out of my pants!
1445;The first scary part is when Katie enters her room, to see that her TV is on, and a picture of a well is on it.
1446;The third scary part is the tape, which shows frightining images.
1447;The first time I saw this in the theater and it was very nice.
1448;I had a lot of after thoughts about the movie and was refreshed by its style.
1449;It's worth one watch though.
1450;The Ring is one of the most successful horror movies of recent years and is sure to spawn a series of sequels.
1451;The cinematography is some of the best I saw in 2002.
1452;She locates the tape, which she watches.
1453;the movie's high visual style and competent acting were enough to make me find it fairly enjoyable.
1454;I will be reviewing the actual Japanese version when I view it, so stay tuned.BR
1455;I saw this in theatres 3 times, and it was good.
1456;Although it was scary and had a story line that was both confusing and just wrong at times, it was worth watching.
1457;It was a perfect gift.
1458;The good news is that there are several images in this movie that are truly frightening.
1459;This is a perfect example where a moviemaker relied too much on the photography and not nearly enough time on the story.
1460;a great thriller with some chills but the end where the kid says she doesnt sleep is a real hole in the story.
1461;Watts is sexy and great as always, but the fact I liked this movie is because it had some spizazz, intelligent scenes.
1462;Several horror films of the past thirty years or so have become classic expressly due to their chilling atmosphere, unusual photography, and enigmatic endings: Carnival of Souls, The Haunting, The Others, to name a few.
1463;Along comes this flashy terrorfest called The Ring.
1464;Naomi Watts is very good as the heroine, looking somewhat like a younger version of both Nicole Kidman and the divine Lara Parker.
1465;Martin Henderson has a boyish charm, yet soft machismo, that makes his Noah expand beyond the cardboard character he's given to play.
1466;And that's where this movie's strength truly lies.
1467;the cinematography, atmospheric music by Hans Zimmer, and a small cameo by the brilliant Jane Alexander, also help elevate this movie.
1468;Watts is good to watch, there are plenty of scares
1469;As she gets closer to a solution to her problem, she discovers more and more details about the death of a young girl many years ago.
1470;mainly, Verbinski does a good job of pulling the viewer into the movie.
1471;The film also benefits from its lack of special effects.
1472;generated special effects are easily spotted, so it is refreshing to watch a movie in which the effects are kept simple.
1473;also, the movie has a believable (although unfeasible) plot, which helps allow the viewer to be frightened.
1474;taken as a whole however, Verbinski's The Ring is a very good movie.
1475;It is definitely worth watching, if not for its scariness, then for its suspense.
1476;up in her closet with mouth agape, putrid and soaking wet, she resembles the tormented soul in Edvard Munch's infamous masterpiece, The Scream.
1477;off his teacher's concern, resolving Aidan's sketches depict his deceased cousin, Katie.
1478;The innuendo infuriates Rachel, but raises her consciousness as well.
1479;Samara has a story to tell.
1480;raising to a spiritually enlightened, capable female lead character, separating it from dronish portrayals in more banal slasher.
1481;with each passing day, Samara broadcasts more powerful, revelatory hallucinations of significant persons, places, and events, such as her ill.
1482;in the end, this potent, metaphysical cocktail of a film imbibes us with a morally perplexing, catch.22 twist: If faced with our own impending deaths, and that of our loved ones, including our children, and given only one chance to save everyone, would we take it?
1483;near equivalents of their adult counterparts, which we should welcome.
1484;Concomitantly, he warns us that our children are fragile and vulnerable beings, which should disarm us.
1485;It is really the best horror movie that I collected.
1486;Then I found an original The Ring video , titled The Ringu at the video store.
1487;I was surprised to hear three Ringu movies.
1488;I can't pick one of two to be the best horror movie, but I picked both.
1489;Just an urban legend, right?
1490;The Ring has one of the best stories out there.
1491;the cast does a stellar job of presenting believable characters and making the fear altogether more real.
1492;Naomi Watts is great in the role of Rachel Keller, the investigative reporter who searches for the answer to the mystery of The Ring.
1493;Her character is mainly the focus of the film, though not entirely, and she does a wonderful job of making her character both a wonderful mother figure as well as a strong hero.
1494;David Dorfman does a great job at giving a creepy feeling to the audience but also making the audiences feel sympathetic toward his character.
1495;But rest assured, she does a fabulous job in this important role.
1496;Gore Verbinski, whose next project is Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, does a great job of presenting the right amount of tension and excitement in parts of the film where it is needed.
1497;One film, that is above and beyond all the rest and is considered the greatest film of our time.
1498;The Sixth Sense was the last one, The Ring is the new scary film on the block.
1499;the Ring is a movie about a young newsreporter with one child and she is divorced.
1500;Personally I thought it was a heck of a story.
1501;The detail the amazing acting by Naomi Watts, was absolutley stunning.
1502;The Ring uses almost no blood or gore and in my mind is the best scary movie since the sixth sense.
1503;ONe reall good thing about the movie though is that it will play with your mind and make anyone believe that you are actually in the story.
1504;The Ring is probably the best movie to come out of 2002.
1505;i thought that it was brilliantly done.
1506;The Ring is an American adaptation of a Japanese horror film.
1507;the movie is much more psychological thriller than slasher.
1508;There is very little in the way of gore to the movie, it is all surprise and suspense.
1509;It is definitely a smarter horror movie, in the sense that you can even call it a horror movie.
1510;If you like smart, suspenseful and kind of creepy movies, this is definitely worth giving a shot.
1511;Creepy, not too gory, great suspense.
1512;Keeps your attention and you will watch it more than once as you will see things you missed the first go around
1513;From the eerie, surreal cinematography to the unpredictable plot turns and terrifying ending, this is absolutely the best scary movie I have ever seen (and I have watched hundreds).
1514;I will say no more about the plot
1515;If you liked movies like the original The Haunting from the 1960's, you will love this one.
1516;The camerawork was beautifully in.
1517;sync with the killer rollercoaster of a plot, the music makes the experienece worthwhile, and the eerie blue lighting suits the horror theme as the yellow.
1518;saw it, loved it, got a phonecall.
1519;She is a successful jouranlist that is investigating the death of her teenage niece.
1520;According to her niece's friends, it was due to a teenage urban myth.
1521;Rachel's son Aidan (David Dorfman)claims that he can speak to the girl in the video, and draws pictures of its contents to prove it.
1522;This pushes Noah and Rachel to believe that Aidan's life is in danger as well, and they both become determined to solve the mystery behind the tape to keep the curse from happening.
1523;The Ring is without a doubt the best horror film that I have seen in a while.
1524;With all of the ridiculous Hollywood slasher films out there, it was nice to finally see a change of pace.
1525;The thrills that the film offers are very mature and realistic.
1526;The special effects were incredible, and will make you flinch at times.
1527;The film overall is fast paced, and the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat for the majority of the film.
1528;Naomi Watts does a very good job as Rachel.
1529;The emotion that she portrays is very realistic, and she looks legitimately scared for her life.
1530;Brian Cox and Martin Henderson were also fantastic.
1531;Best performance of a young boy in a horror film since Haley Joel Osmand in Sixth Sense .
1532;In a movie such as this, the viewer wants to be scared and entertained.
1533;The Ring is an excellent horror film with very few flaws.
1534;While you may be slightly confused at the outcome of the film, you will be scared out of your mind and entertained overall.
1535;seen short film created by the director that reveals secrets about the film.
1536;You also get to see a trailer for the film Ringu , which is the Japansese film that The Ring was based on.
1537;That little creepy deal girl will keep you up at night!
1538;the hype surrounding the film notwithstanding, I really watched it with a clear objective eye, and I was very much impressed by what I saw.
1539;Being sick and tired with the usual horror movies formula of blood and gore and predictable endings, The Ring provided a fresh alternative, boosted by a very good script, haunting piano and strings score, talented director and excellent acting.
1540;i would put the Ring along with The Blair Witch, and the Others as the most intelligent horror movie I have seen since The Omen/Excorist period!!
1541;Both films have a supernatural edge and an ending that far from giving an answer, deepens the mystery.
1542;like The Omen and The Exorcist, the use the innocence of a child as a vehicle for evil is part of why The Ring works well.
1543;the 'evil' tape in question is very well filmed and edited and is truly spooky, especially since we see it at the begining.Yet there are some flaws in the The Ring.
1544;the role of the child is under developed, and not as prominent as it is in the Sixth Sense.
1545;but overall, I give it full marks, because it is an intelligent horror film, that will keep you at the edge of your seat, and because we really need similar films more often.
1546;I didn't see this movie in theaters, but my friend saw it and she thought it was good.
1547;I rated it 3 stars because I actually need to understand the movie to really like it.
1548;The reporter makes the link between the niece, the movie, the girl, and the .
1549;I suggest this movie to the brave, to the scary movie buff, and to anyone hoping for a night of amazing television.
1550;Along the way she digs up an eery story of a little unloved girl, and finds love of her own.
1551;the mood of this movie was appropriately dark, with a mounting tension and dread played out very well.
1552;I thought this movie was pretty good but I felt it was missing something.
1553;Her nephew who seems to be possessed draws pictures of the ring from the videotape.
1554;She and her boyfriend uncover that their pictures get messed up after they watched the tape.
1555;She decides to broadcast the tape so the little girl's voice can be heard.
1556;It ties together very nicely, and will suit those who like a little but of thought to their movies, as well as those who just plain like to be scared.
1557;I thought this movie was pretty spooky and held my interest from beginning to end.
1558;This is a fresh idea for the horror genre.
1559;The special effect of the girl crawling out of the TV was pretty cool though.
1560;it's just hard to see the point in making it in the first place.
1561;if you prefer genuine horror movies to teen.
1562;I liked it very much and I recommend it.
1563;This wouldv'e been a great 5 star movie but the ending is gay.
1564;I am a huge fan of the horror genre, and I just have to say this is by far one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.
1565;The plot fit together perfectly, and everything was brought to a stunning conclusion.
1566;before The Ring, the scariest movie I have ever seen is The Omen but I think The Ring might be ahead now.
1567;It is so much better than those teen slasher flicks, it is smart, very suspenseful, and very creepy.
1568;Everyone in it had excellent performances, and the young boy brought in a Sixth Sense element.
1569;I would definitely reccomend seeing it, but make sure you take someone along with you!!
1570;This was a wonderful movie.
1571;I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was alot better than some of the others that have come out (i. e., The Sixth Sense, etc.).
1572;It is one that scares you because of what you don't know what it is exactly that you are seeing.
1573;It will keep you guessing until the end.
1574;the bottom line is, The Ring is a perfect movie for:a) Slumber party / Sleepoverb) Horror movie marathon, andc) Any excuse to get close to someone (wink, wink)But don't say I didn't warn you.
1575;This was by far the scariest movie I have seen in a while.
1576;I did have a nice evening alone.
1577;especially with such a nice, active imagination like mine.
1578;and I like scary movies.
1579;But, the scary movies I like are purely psychological
1580;though the build up and overall atmosphere was perfect.
1581;now that my rant is over, let me go ahead and say that the movie was extremely well done, and accomplishes what the fillmmakers were going for in frighteningly precise fashion.
1582;I see Samara in the dark everytime I turn around!
1583;I suggest checking out the Japanese film it was based on
1584;Great performances and some thoughtful and subtle direction, make this an intriguing diversion.
1585;overall though, a triumph of style over substance.
1586;Based on a Japanese movie that I've never had the pleasure of viewing, The Ring might possibly be the scariest movie to ever come out of Hollywood, at least in my opinion.
1587;At this it succeeds by a long shot.
1588;I love the mood of the film, as it stays dark and dreadful the whole way through.
1589;a movie rarely comes along that scares me.
1590;that said, the first ten minutes are extraordinary.
1591;Nicely shot, creepy, beautifully paced, and well acted.
1592;That works for The Ring, too.
1593;A remake of the Japanese film Ringu, the Ring is quite possibly the best thriller to come out of Hollywood in a very long time.
1594;seat movie, The Ring combines eerie cinematography, disturbing imagery and well written story telling into an arabesque masterpiece, with plenty of shocks, surprises and twists to keep you interested.
1595;Using moments of sheer suspense and mind bending twists rather than constant bloodspray to terrify the viewer, The Ring is sure to keep you awake for weeks to come.
1596;This is the most scary non.
1597;it also combines some true sad emotions.
1598;This was a very good and scary movie.
1599;i actually thought this movie was very good.
1600;the art style (especially on the videotape itself) added to the eerie atmosphere of the whole thing.
1601;while the explanation of the plot wasn't pulled off well and didn't make much sense, up until the last 15 minutes or so, the movie will have your eyes glued to the screen.
1602;from here, you can basically do what you want.
1603;if all goes well, you should be telling people about this one for quite a while.
1604;I saw The Ring for the first time at school and it really disturbed me.
1605;regardless of what you think about horror films, this one is a unique experience.
1606;The best thing is that it does not rely on a ton of special effects to get the job done, a rarity these days.
1607;Movie buffs should get a lot out of some of the interesting scenes in here.
1608;it is nice to see that Watts recovered from her dismal role in Children of the Corn IV.
1609;Hopefully this movie is a jump start for career.
1610;basically, this is a great movie for anyone who wants to be scared.
1611;The green levels are nicely balanced.
1612;Fine detail is generally good, even during the darkest scenes (and this film has a lot of them), black levels are rich and deep and contrast levels (between green and more green) are good.
1613;Also, film grain is present throughout and is, at times, distracting.
1614;If you think this is a great horror movie, my condolences.
1615;This remake not only covers the central plot of the Japanese thriller, Ringu, it also takes into account events of Ringu II and the original content of the novels.
1616;This makes The Ring a nice condensed version of the Ring story on a whole.
1617;A lot was added, mostly for the effect.
1618;There's a lot of great eye candy in The Ring, which is nice for movie goers who are in it more for the thrill than for subtlty.
1619;There's also a lot of symbolism.
1620;Just something fun to do, as you watch, try to think about what the ring actually is in this movie.
1621;As the clock starts to count down the time she has left, she consults the help of an old friend, Noah, to help her solve the mystery of the video tape.
1622;The cast is pretty good, but not exceptional.
1623;In Ringu, he served his purpose merely as the quiet and eerie son who is put in danger.
1624;Yet somehow, he is able to predict his cousin's death through pictures and gets messages from a mysterious little girl.
1625;Both innocent and creepy, which easily manipulated most of the viewers.
1626;Still, the imagery for many of the key scenes is brilliant.
1627;so in conclusion, The Ring is a very well.
1628;done and thorough remake of Ringu, including many key parts of the story found in the Japanese sequels as well as some extra tidbits made just for this adaption.
1629;The story is left in tact, making The Ring and Ringu very comparable, and the cast is strong enough to carry the story where needed.
1630;The special effects and symmetry play a key role in this movie, but are used quite effectively.
1631;It's amazing that a movie such as this can be so complex and horrifying, yet have so little plot.
1632;Some of the images are really frightening.
1633;While watching it I really got into it, and thought it was going to find some great way to finesh itself and explain everything.
1634;The movie was very complex, and you had to think to get what was going on, but despite this it still maneged to not truely make sence.
1635;And that is a sign of a good horror movie.
1636;a little side note: The Ring is actually based on a Japanese movie which in turn is based on a novel.
1637;The first time I watched this movie, I was hooked.
1638;It's frightening, keeps you guessing every minute, and unpredictable.
1639;I am a huge fan of horror and suspense and I have not been shaken like that since I first saw Blair witch (when I thought it was REAL) This is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great scare.
1640;of taking a fascinating premise and doing absolutely nothing fascinating with it in a movie.
1641;There are a few decent (decent, NOT good) scares lasting maybe 2 minutes.
1642;The audience for which the original version was intended would already have known the basic story (a very interesting idea) and the attraction lay in seeing a new interpetation, just as one might go to see a new performance of Hamlet
1643;This can be frustrating for European and American audiences but, once understood, actually provides a very refreshing viewing experience.
1644;anyway, onto the American version.
1645;sure, there are some 'jumpy bits' and a few moments that will unnerve the viewer .
1646;but the true terror of The Ring exists in the dilemma it poses.
1647;But overall I think that the American film is superior, it does successfully reconcile some of the jarring elements of the original's plot (again, I shouldn't mention any specific moments) and the story moves more naturally (the Japanese version relies heavily on psychic flashback .
1648;this film is in my opinion one of the best examples of a supernatural thriller to come out of any country in recent years.
1649;The Ring is a superb hybrid of a thriller/horror film that will keep you enthralled and, in true great horror film fashion, will make your flesh crawl.
1650;Imbued with a seemingly simplistic idea about an urban legend about a tape that kills its viewers within 7 days, this taut film is propelled by superb direction and genuinely creepy shots interspersed throughout the film that will startle and scare.
1651;Her race against time is compelling and not without many surprises.
1652;The supporting cast is exceptional as well with another great supporting performance from Brian Cox as a troubled father.
1653;up work is also quite excellent as I still can't get those dead people out of my head!
1654;The horror aspect of the film makes this more of an Exorcist.
1655;The Ring is a Horror movie (and one of the most scaring ones).
1656;It is suitable for teenagers and adults.
1657;husband and her child watch the tape as well and then they try to look for the origins of the tape and to save their lives.
1658;i recommend to all of the Horror movie lovers to go and watch this movie, I garantee you won't sleep peacfully at night after watching it.
1659;I liked the film for the most part because it was very creepy and had a great atmosphere to it.
1660;The characters were pretty interesting as well.
1661;The most over rated movie since Blair Witch Project.
1662;Oh, I remember when this movie came out.
1663;First, I remember watching it.
1664;My favorite movie is calld The Ring.
1665;it is about a girl who lived in a well for years and now she has awoken.
1666;she is coming for you!As I was saying she wakes up and she is haunting every one in the city.
1667;i thought this movie was a really good thriller, and the fact that it took time to explain how the movie was made and where it originated from was a great plot.
1668;please someone one tell me.
1669;Naomi Watts is a great actress(I Loved her in Mullholland Drive).
1670;The Ring is one of those highly entertaining films you don't want to get too high and mighty over to enjoy.
1671;Just jerky enough to jostle you but seamless enough to keep the spell going.
1672;What recommends this film most is that it is entertaining and engaging.
1673;Immediatly you start to think Oh Jeez they're still making these films!
1674;But the photography is dark and realistic and the girls are oh so cute so.
1675;The fun is trying to figure out what comes next.
1676;The director shows some humor and even pays tribute to Hitch with the scene in the shower where the beautiful Naomi Watts is washing off the blood and the camera pans to the drain.
1677;She obviously carries the film along.
1678;The supporting actors are all in good form.
1679;I'm glad that Hollywood got ahold of RINGU and made this amazing horror movie!
1680;There have always been mini rumors of a similar subject floating around, but this makes it fun!
1681;it was very good and hopefully it will become a classic like Carrie and Jaws, and maybe a sequal is in order!
1682;That would be realy interesting to see how that movie goes about, like maybe take the viewers into the world of Samara, or go into more detail about her life.
1683;Michael Jackson's face scares me more!
1684;what makes this movie is the sound: horrifyingly brilliant.
1685;speaking of corpses, they are refreshingly few and far between.
1686;And was she the crazy one, or her mom?All in all, a brilliant movie that with a couple minutes of work at the end could make it a classic.
1687;I did enjoy it and will watch it again and again.
1688;a nice enough start, but it's all down hill from here folks.
1689;I will say that it had some nice visual effects and the video itself was actually kind of neat.
1690;Better yet, DO see it for yourself and share in my pain and agony.
1691;This movie rocks, it's the best horror movie ever maded.
1692;It's on my top 5 best movies of all time.
1693;If you like horror movie you will like The Ring.
1694;On the plus side, The Ring's production values are outstanding and the acting is solid.
1695;I'm sure The Ring stands up nicely next to the original.
1696;Some ambiguity here is probably a good thing.
1697;The idea of a killer video tape might seem dated and a bit hokey but truth in fiction it is all in the spellbinding storytelling and this sly film draws you into an alternate reality Seattle where this unsettling possibility seems plausible.
1698;Watching The Ring is like watching a light version of Ringu 1 and 2.
1699;it's a good enough movie, though.
1700;I wouldnt go as far as saying that, as many have, this is the scariest movie ever made.
1701;The beginning will keep you creeped out enough, and the ending is better.
1702;the movie is filmed very well, and the music is probably the scariest part of the movie, other than the ending.
1703;Some hated it, some loved it.
1704;I liked it a lot.
1705;It is worth the money.
1706;It's a favorite late night horror flick of mine.
1707;You see it in your head, the images follow you, and after seven days you die.
1708;well, the movie managing to do so well what it intends to do I DON'T CARE!
1709;A masterpiece of its' genre, Halloween or Nightmare On Elm Street will never be the same after this!Creepy!
1710;This movie is okay, considering the plot.
1711;The special effects are pretty good, and there are some parts that make you scream out loud.
1712;The Ring was an excellent movie that taunted all sense of logic and became one of the greatest psychological thrillers I have seen.
1713;Not really but the movie does work quite well with it and the end result is something you won't soon forget.
1714;It's best classified as psychological horror.
1715;This is a thinking person's horror movie, and tells its story through hints, both visual and in the screenplay.
1716;The mystery element is very effective, and keeps you involved in the story.
1717;the acting is excellent, as is the writing.
1718;done, engaging, enjoyable, and also disturbing.
1719;The Ring weaves a masterful plot that drives the horror.
1720;It is hard to find a good scary movie these days but The Ring has restored my faith in a person's ability to write a rock solid thriller.
1721;The Ring actually has a lot of commonalities with The Changeling but The Ring blows you away with a stomach.
1722;I hope writers continue to create these kind of thrillers.
1723;Just when you thought horror films would never be good again, The Ring comes about to save the genre.
1724;The film's strength lies on its mood and atmosphere, with the plot, acting and dialogue all good enough to keep the film afloat without detracting from its creepy fun.
1725;but it did give me quite a few good chills and thrills!
1726;The cinematography was spectacular in creating the feel of the movie.
1727;The imagery was intense and spooky .
1728;so it does a good job at being a horror movie, but don't expect it to scare you out of your pants!
1729;The ring is best described as a horror film.
1730;It is definitely a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
1731;Throughout the movie Rachel (the protagonist, played by Naomi Watts)finds more and more clues and pieces it together at the end of the movie.
1732;As well as looking on the internet for more information.
1733;i would recommend this movie to people who like horror and thrill.
1734;I thought it was an excellent movie with an excellent plot.
1735;sCARES Signs also had a positive ending with a somewhat Christian influence.
1736;I do give credit to the nice visual effects, the creepy and somewhat depressing musical score, and last but not least, the great actors, especially Naomi Watts, who played Rachel Keller in this film.
1737;Great acting job(even though she was better in Lilo and Stitch).
1738;All it is is pure entertainment.
1739;Ok let me just say that I'm a huge horror movie fan and usually can laugh my way through most of them.
1740;I can relate to this so much!!!
1741;so you can imagine how scared I was.
1742;I still see things in the reflection.
1743;Also the to screen at the end was more realistic because she looked real.
1744;In the American version samara was all blue and grainy but sadako is totally natural.
1745;The visuals and music are much creepier in the American version as well.
1746;In fact I had to see the movie 5 times before I had the courage to look at samara's face at the end.
1747;I love horror and strange and my entire family loved the story and effects!
1748;I have rewatched it several times and still enjoy it.
1749;Imagination is used to it's full potential in this script.
1750;The mood set is so creepy, and the movie is driven by that mood, and a suprisingly interesting mystery.
1751;like I've said probrably 100 times in this review, this is a big breath of fresh air, and if you want a good creepy movie for a rainy day or relaxed night, pick this up.
1752;Nice add on to the collection.
1753;by the way, if you're scared of little girls in horror movies, like I am, get ready, this is going to be fun!
1754;Always a good one to watch!
1755;Start with a spot of The Sixth Sense , blend in a pinch of Ghost Story , add a smidgen of Scary Movie and throw in a dash of David Cronenberg's Videodrome and you have the basic ingredients for The Ring .
1756;the film is good to look at and features a few genuine spooky scenes, but it doesn't rise above the standard things.
1757;the one saving grace is the appearance of Jane Alexander, one of stage and screen's must underused talents, in a small but significant part.
1758;The Excorcist and the Shining did it for me I thought.
1759;The perfect combination for a good movie.
1760;But after hearing more about the tape and learning of other coinciding mysterious deaths
1761;She also receives chilling phone call after viewing it.
1762;He talks about someone he seems to know but how he knows this person is really interresting.
1763;He reminds me of the little kid Danny from The Shining.
1764;The movie is pretty interesting though and keeps you guessing till the very end.
1765;The music throughout the whole movie is well composed and it does wonders to some of the scenes throughout.
1766;Place close attention to the film because many scenes relate back to the tape and it will help you understand it better.
1767;Its just to great to describe.
1768;It does have some very good moments, and is worth watching and probably owning if you like this genre.
1769;Still a very clever idea.
1770;shot picture full of gorgeous and spooky set.
1771;candy, secondary to the ingenious plot and chilling photography.
1772;Director Gore Verbinski should be proud of himself for having done such an impressive job with monochromatic shots, the Seattle weather and minimal special effects.
1773;The overall visual impression of 'The Ring' is truly unsettling.
1774;for all of that, though, 'The Ring' works well as a modern standalone horror movie, and is certainly one of the betterHollywood offerings of recent years.
1775;laden and far , far more effecting, 'Ringu' is a Classic.
1776;First of all, let's go over what's right with this movie.
1777;The scary parts are actually scary.
1778;The first time I saw it in the theater, I was on the edge of my seat and felt jittery when the movie got tense.
1779;If you're just looking for a few scares or something to watch to make your girlfriend cuddle up a little closer to you, this is it.
1780;Great movie at a great price.
1781;Good effects and some scary moments.
1782;I might not agree with others that it was the scariest movie ever, but I thought it was skillfully.
1783;made and had some genuinely creepy moments.
1784;I really liked the overall atmosphere it created, and the effects were subtle, for the most part, not overdone.
1785;The meat of it is that I enjoyed it.
1786;It's a good scary movie, though classics like The Haunting are still scarier.
1787;It was a serious, genuine attempt at a classic horror film.
1788;the first 5 to 10 minutes of The Ring probably represents the most genuinely scary part of the whole movie.
1789;This was a good way to go, as it certainly put me on edge for the rest of the movie.
1790;The main subject of the film (as is probably well.
1791;As a practical matter, this is pretty much an impossibility.
1792;another nice detail was the way the images from the tape are worked into the days that follow.
1793;Some of the parallels between real life and the tape are subtle, but they are definitely there.
1794;one really surprising thing about the film was the music, which was understated and subtle throughout.
1795;top scores such as Gladiator or Mission: Impossible 2, had worked on The Ring.
1796;I admire Zimmer and I enjoy his scores in general, but he truly outdid himself for this film.
1797;The music is a strong counterpoint to the atmosphere of the movie, and Zimmer abandoned his usually.
1798;He had a soft touch with the music, for once, and it really added a great deal to the movie.
1799;Somewhat like The Blair Witch Project, The Ring sets up an effective tone early on, and never really lets up.
1800;Through a steady series of surprises, it manages to keep the audience guessing about what's going to happen next.
1801;I had several gasp moments during the film, because it managed to surprise me several times.
1802;And the effects were done well enough that even such impossiblities remained convincing.
1803;The scares in The Ring are well.
1804;the end result is that The Ring is a good, solid horror film, and makes no pretensions otherwise.
1805;Though not as good as some of the classics, it definitely hearkens back to the days of movies like The Haunting or Rosemary's Baby, as one of those rare horror movies that simply accomplishes what it sets out to do .
1806;The fact that the film's terrors reach us through our new media .
1807;From a somewhat typical horror movie opening scene, The Ring develops into a well.
1808;crafted horror/mystery that is never obvious, and just when you think you've got it all figured out, the truly surprising finish makes you reevaluate everything that has come before.
1809;The fact that the filmakers were able to make a film this effective and maintain a PG.13 rating is a testament to how little blood and gore add to a truly frightening movie.
1810;I know that it's the ultimate in cultural snobbery when successful foreign films are remade for an American audience, but I feel that The Ring is much more effective than Ringu , it's Japanese inspiration.
1811;This is an Americanization of Ringu (1998), a Japanese horror film that was well aclaimed.
1812;urban Legend holds that viewers of a particular video will die seven days after seeing the film.
1813;this film suffers from lackluster acting
1814;I was pleasantly surprised by how effectively well made this movie was and it was a REMAKE!
1815;The Ring had a good story and all.
1816;the Ring 2 will be dumber of course it will.
1817;i want to go see the Grudge from the trailer it looked good.
1818;it is scary, I'll give you that.
1819;The disturbing images and whatnot we have to see, then the story of the little girl is very successful at giving me chills at least.
1820;And the movie itself was something new and refreshing to see in the US theaters, among the other ho.
1821;the film starts off with a promising premise.
1822;death not merely for herself but for her loved ones as well.
1823;The Ring has some nice moments of suspense right up front, but the more Rachel unravels the mystery the less mysterious and terrifying the film becomes.
1824;Naomi Watts is energetic and attractive as the feisty heroine of the story, but the clues she uncovers just aren't very interesting or compelling.
1825;The Ring is competently made and nicely atmospheric at times, but it doesn't get under your skin the way the best horror films invariably do.
1826;All we are left to do is watch Rachel racing against the clock looking for answers, turning The Ring into more of a whodunit mystery than a tale of terror.
1827;It's smart, expertly crafted, tense, beautiful, and damn good storytelling.
1828;You care about these characters, and the director knew how to scare you.
1829;It draws you in and keeps the story moving at just the right pace.
1830;The movie's atmosphere is incredible.
1831;When the last frightening scene rolls around, you'll definitely be on edge.
1832;I chose this rating because I watched the movie and I found I love it.
1833;I really like this movie because it is a good scare.
1834;I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Horror movies with a good story.
1835;I would also recommend this movie to anyone who has seen Ringu and JU.
1836;renowned mythologist, Joseph Campbell, argued that certain tales and images are part of our universal consciousness and, therefore, part of collective human storytelling.
1837;breaking box office smash for Asian audiences (1998), which DreamWorks decided would translate well for American audiences.
1838;The premise is fairly simple.
1839;The aunt of one of the teenagers is a savvy and skeptical journalist whose curiosity is sparked by tales of the tape.
1840;as one born to the genre, Director Verbinski does an excellent job of letting our imaginations find portent and peril in the most mundane of actions, such as picking up groceries at the local corner store.
1841;For all of us who have rolled our eyes at the screaming teen, walking backward alone through the dark house, Watts will be a relief as she plays through the gamut of Rachel's emotions with truly credible, but not overwrought, gusto.
1842;Rachel's son, Aiden (a stony.
1843;goers in dire need of brightly lit rooms and laughter.
1844;families who see this movie should talk about the decision that Rachel makes at the end of the movie and the ramifications of her actions.
1845;I love horror and mystery movies!
1846;it had a good story and it was actually scary(for me).
1847;Here on video is The Ring, one of the most terrifying films of the last 20 years.
1848;It's an instant classic, a movie like Seven or The Blair Witch Project that redefines your expectations of the what the horror film genre can deliver.
1849;It begins with the constant chill of dread and intensifies until it explodes into one of the most unforgettable endings ever.
1850;this is one of those rare movies that has you dreading the next scene, not because it's bad, but because you know when it comes it will pack a wallop.
1851;Naomi Watts, fresh from her triumph in Mullholland Dr., gives a plucky and touching performance in the lead as the young reporter and mother who finds herself up against unimaginable evil.
1852;minute, artfully edited short film that is made up of outtakes from The Ring.
1853;If you are a fan of genuinely scary movies, you can't afford to miss this.
1854;This is the American remake of a Japanese movie, based on Japanese novels and manga, or adult comic books.
1855;The images are shocking, terrifying, unforgettable.
1856;Therefore, it's a film based on images rather than story line.
1857;This odd melding of the spiritual with the technical sheds a little light onto the distorted origins of this tale.
1858;Give people gorgeous, shocking images, and they're happy .
1859;they'll grin from ear to ear.
1860;i give it 3 stars because it's genuinely very scary, and scary in new ways that I've really not seen before.
1861;So on purely technical grounds, it's a solid effort.
1862;during this movie) are neatly filled in by lots of confabulating fans filling in the details.
1863;This film takes the right road in makeing in scary in your mind.
1864;After seeing this I immediately wanted to tell everyone I knew about it.
1865;Naomi Watts performance was awesome as with the rest of the cast.
1866;The story is wonderful with great plot twists.
1867;Diapers for crying out loud!Everyone I know loves this movie.
1868;I know most of you have heard about this movie and about how scary it is.
1869;This is the best attempt at a horror movie in a while.
1870;Overall, this movie is actually a pretty good movie and that is why i gave it 4 stars.
1871;This movie is defiantly one of my all.
1872;the Ring is good because it scares you, while skipping all the senseless blood, violence, and gore.
1873;It is a suspensful movie, that is easy to follow.
1874;The child's psychological state of mind may be viewed as insane but her nature clearly reflects what human nature in general is like.
1875;Superb horror with depth but the first one had a much deeper meaning as its main goal was to introduce us to Samara.
1876;Like the past, present, and future, people and things changed, but nevertheless, your core self is still the same.
1877;i actually liked this first one because it is more deeper and symbolic.
1878;well I got a lot more out of it.
1879;the Ring has a simple plot about a video tape and after you watch it you have seven days to live.
1880;well ok,I thought this could be interesting.
1881;from start to finish the movie is a scary ride.
1882;the Ring is sure enought to scare you half to death and keep you very involved with the film.
1883;the acting is very good and the movie is amazing.
1884;The Hollywood plastic factory ruins yet another unique concept and form of cinematography.
1885;the best thing about 'Ringu' the original was that they didn't rely on updated special effects or creating an overlly modern look.
1886;It was realistic and gripping because it was so raw and simplistic.
1887;The narrative and visual sequences were full of symbolism and artistic integrity.
1888;if you're not that easily influenced, show patronage and see the original.
1889;Needless to say this is one of them.
1890;Both powerful performances and fabulous special effects make this move one of the greatest horror movies I have ever seen.
1891;I aboslutely loved this movie.
1892;Definitely my kind of scary movie.
1893;Granted, the plot of this movie has a few holes, but it is by far the scariest movie I have ever seen.
1894;This was undoubtebly the scariest movie I have ever seen.
1895;I'm surprised I haven't had any nightmares about it yet.
1896;Anyway, most of it was probably done just for the shock, and, well, it worked.
1897;this movie has one of the scariest movie scenes of all time.
1898;I think the particular scene at the end (I won't spoil it here) is a classic.
1899;The Ring is all about the visual and audio effects, and what a masterful job Gore Verbinski does with them.
1900;A fantastic movie that really grows on you.
1901;This is one of my favorite horror films of all time and relies instead on mystery and suspense then an axe to the head and flowing blood.
1902;The cast is perfect, with great performances by Daveigh Chase, Naomi Watts, Amber Tamblyn and most notably of all unbelievably beautiful and underrated actress Rachael Bella who plays the character Becca Kotler.
1903;Daveigh is also memorable as Samara Morgan.
1904;If you don't know anything about this movie, as I did when I went in, then you're in for a treat.
1905;the acting is very convincing.
1906;Having never seen the original, Ringu, I can't compare them but the story has a way of tying itself together, weaving a series of seemingly unrelated things together.
1907;Good movie, full of suspense and scares.
1908;It is good on blue.
1909;It has a good place in my collection.
1910;she chats with the girl's high school friends, putting her skills as a reporter to the test (hi, i smoked pot once is enough to create a bond: dude, she's cool.
1911;we should, like, tell her stuff).
1912;making his own lunches, drawing alone often .
1913;she enlists her friend (the boy's father, though no one seems to have ever told little david) to help uncover the mystery behind the tape, which they copy so that they can study the images, which include horses washed up on a beach, a tree whose leaves appear sanguine in the sunlight, and a woman brushing her hair.
1914;the movie does have a few moments that are genuinely unnerving.
1915;A reporter, played by Naomi Watts, plays detective and unravels the mystery of the tape while becoming directly involved.
1916;The Ring has several genuinely terrifying scenes that will keep the viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.
1917;well this is a great movie.
1918;I must say from the opening scene on, I was definitely pleasantly surprised.
1919;All I can say is that this movie is without a doubt the scariest movie I've ever seen.
1920;With a great twist of an ending, I left the theatre very surprised at what I had just sene.
1921;And I mean that in a good way definitely.
1922;It starts with a bang and though it does flag at times, overall it keeps up the suspense.
1923;The makeup and special effects were very realistic, and the plot has a pseudo.
1924;So if you like a good scare, and you're not prone to nightmares, see this movie!
1925;Excellent film on just the shock value alone!
1926;The Ring Part One does have some action at the very beginning of the movie.
1927;Perhaps, The Ring part two will give the movie audience a clear answer to that question.
1928;hopefully, part two will clear up the confusion that part one's storyline contained.
1929;One familiar face is in the movie's opening scene.
1930;She was also in the Grude part 1 and 2 as the sister of Sarah Michelle Gellar.
1931;this movie is similiar to the Grudge because of the scary spirit that's in the form of a murdered little girl.
1932;despite the unclear storyline, I give this movie three stars due to good special effects and the potential to be very suspenseful.
1933;This was a great movie.
1934;At first I thought that it might be kind of stupid or geared towards kids, but it held my interest the entire time.
1935;Of course, it has a supernatural bent, which stretches the imagination a bit, but for that genre, it was very well done.
1936;the story moves quickly, the acting is good, and I imagine that watching it at night with the lights out would be creepy.
1937;Lots of fun and I liked it.
1938;the boy in Ringu also has a much creepier feel about him, the fact that he almost never opens his mouth adds to the creepiness of the whole movie, while in The Ring he seems to be a pretty major character and talks quite a lot, which detracted.
1939;in the mouth of madness is a good head trip movie to.
1940;Believe me, this movie will stay with you long after the last frame.
1941;ray, this is a movie that I enjoyed multiple times and probably will multiple times more.
1942;The Ring took lovely Aussie Naomi Watts career from a no name artsy independent film and TV movie actress to an A. list Hollywood celebrity.
1943;Ten years later, and even after a half a dozen viewings The Ring still delivers, even when you know when the scares are about to come it still succeeds in delivering the chills.
1944;The Painted Veil (love to see this get a blu.
1945;bender will give you a migraine)3.
1946;THE RING is one of the greatest horror flicks ever made.
1947;This is the most weirdest movie that I can think of.
1948;The Ring is a great modern horror movie, especially when you consider how hard it is for horror movies to be scary nowadays.
1949;The 1st Ring is so much better than the 2nd.
1950;It has more meaning and is a whole lot scarier than the 2nd!
1951;Sure, it's not the easiest plot to follow, but at least it's full of suspense!
1952;It's movies like these that are restoring my faith in horror culture.
1953;You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film!
1954;Xmas gift for my mother, we are both horror lovers.
1955;I am a great horror movie fan.
1956;And the whole psychic kid deal is pretty old.
1957;Every horror film since The Shining seems to think a psychic kid means big scares.
1958;Delivered right on time and in perfect condition!
1959;'The Ring', the movie that started the trend, is actually one of the ones that exceeds its predecessor.
1960;It keeps everything that madeRingugood, but benefits from some added angles, better special effects, and deeper characterization on some of the supporting players.
1961;In this case, both the original and the remake had equally cool takes on the backstory.
1962;The basic premise behind The Ring is now one of the best known set.
1963;You never hear exactly what's said on the call, but you can just make out enough of it that, by that and the reaction of the person receiving the call (this is one of the things that really made The Ring so great .
1964;the tremendous jobs various performers did in reacting to things that aren't fully shown on screen) it really brings an instant air of sinister otherworldliness.
1965;and eventually comes into possession of the tape itself.
1966;Totally disbelieving of any truth to the supernatural legend, she nonetheless watches the tape, looking for possible clues.
1967;layered horror story that gets scarier and scarier as it unfolds, riveting from the start but leaving the biggest and most memorable frights for the end stages.
1968;The visual imagery of The Ring has become iconic in horrordom, including the stone well, first seen on the videotape itself, and the climax is a masterpiece.
1969;And now we meet her aunt reporter Rachel (Naomi Watts) and her son Aidan (David Dorfman), and she starts to work on the case of her niece's strange and sudden death.
1970;And she question's her niece best friends, a learns of the tape.
1971;She chesk in at the office, and gets the same cottage, to take a nap in, before she returns home, and finds the tape in the office, takes it to the cottage, and watches the tape, and sees a girl on the tape (Daveigh Chase), and then she gets the call, informing her 7 days.
1972;So now what she will do her final 7 days, she inlists the help of her ex.
1973;I can imagine that it would scare younger folk, but I much prefer physiological thrillers such as The Shining by Stanley Kubrick.
1974;Everything about The Ring was simply adequate!
1975;The lighting, the sound, the filming the acting, nothing was fantastic, simply adequate.
1976;This is one of the scariest films I have ever seen.
1977;The disturbing images, mounting suspense, clever editing, intelligent script, and solid direction all contribute to making this very horrific and haunting film a roller coaster ride of terror that stays with you long after the experience of watching it is over.
1978;Naomi Watts is outstanding in the lead role, but all the supporting cast members are terrific as well.
1979;If you like or love the blood and gore kinds of films, then this movie will certainly disappoint you as the focus is on character, story, and mood (which is wonderfully done due to the suberb cinematography, unique special effects, and make.
1980;It is also noteworthy that it's sequel is as equally good and does exactly what a sequel should do and that is continue the storyline and not rehash the original.
1981;I and my family, thanks to the PG.13 rating for its disturbing images and not for gore or sex, totally enjoyed this very effective chiller and its sequel.
1982;all in all, see the original, subtitles and all.
1983;Leave this one alone, please.
1984;The Ring is an amazing film!!!!
1985;It's an amazing film, which keeps you gripped and the actors are superb!
1986;This movie was SO good!!!
1987;i've heard some people say it was dumb, but my best friend and I watch it all the time.
1988;Her face is the kind that sticks in your mind, especially when your alone and have to get something out of your closet.
1989;In the original, the girl's face remains masked by her hair .
1990;She senses her way towards the victims without making eye contact .
1991;If you can, catch the original.
1992;There is a real sense of melancholia in the original .
1993;this movie was the best that i've seen in a long time.
1994;Needless to tell more about the story, it's been written in full detail by many others.
1995;the Ring is the first thriller.
1996;horror film in a long while that has a superb storyline, a brilliant script, and very good to stunning acting performances as well as a great directorial effort.
1997;That's a paradox really, and simoultaneously the Ring's claim to greatness because as you see it creates the impression that it's rather slow, but, there's constantly clues added as you watch, constantly the story evolves and the film doesnt sag at all at any given point.
1998;sequences like the one on the ferry with the horse that goes wild will stay on peoples' minds for a long time but the Ring is actually full of disturbing optics that you keep with you long after you've exited the movie theater.
1999;piece, surely one that will (hopefully) inspire more films in that direction.
2000;didn't is with the use of the beautiful blonde but she does an admittedly very good job in her part and contribution as does everybody in the Ring in general.
2001;That, i think, is a heavy compliment to this flick.
2002;thriller scene or by viewers who like intelligent well made films no matter what the genre.
2003;it gives me the chill even now!
2004;i recommend this to all horror movie lovers, u'll love this!
2005;the movie is a masterpiece touching up on all the classic and newage horror tricks.
2006;that is classic and you know it.
2007;the characters are well played by well groomed and suttle actors.
2008;the story line well, youll have to figure that one out on your own.
2009;you have to create your own point of view, which to me makes for a good movie in itself when the audience truly has to think.
2010;This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
2011;A must see for adults.
2012;First of all, the movie WAS NOT based on Fear Dot Com or some classical piece.
2013;I love horror flicks and I'm not easily scared of movies.
2014;The movie is one of those psychological thrillers.
2015;The movie is pretty good until the end.
2016;See it for yourself and figure out if u like it or not!
2017;One of the best horror films EVER, probably the best, easily.
2018;It made plenty of sense to, and scared the heck out of, everyone I have discussed it with, which is a long list of diverse people.
2019;Very good film for a date, or any group of people who can keep quiet for the length of the film (its kinda long), or at least don't mind rewinding regularly.
2020;Hollywood The town that Made movies like: Casablanca, Its a wonderfull life, and, oh lets say.
2021;And there's a good chance that I'll much prefer it to the remake.
2022;This was my biggest complaint, most of the acting was fine, the kid was good, and Naomi Watts was outstanding.
2023;But Naomi Watts was great here, and once or twice she screams so cinematically wonderful that I really think it's the best scream I've ever seen in a movie.
2024;i actually give this film three and one.
2025;It's similar in style and mood, if not story, to The Others .
2026;and it's obviously influenced by the success of that film.
2027;i compare it to The Others because they are similar types of films (even though the actual plots are nothing alike).
2028;Plus this film stars the amazing actress Naomi Watts, who is famously best friends with Nicole Kidman .
2029;i still think that her performance in Mulholland Drive is, like, one of the greatest film performances of all time.
2030;But she is outstanding here.
2031;The film is worth seeing for them alone.
2032;You see a little of that in the trailer, but you should see it within the context of the story.
2033;this is the scarest movie I've ever seen.
2034;Maybe if I have the guts to, I'l go see it.
2035;i recommend you watch this movie with the lights out and by yourself.
2036;The Ring has to be one of the best scary movies, besides Chuckie, and The Sixth Sense.
2037;ray of The Ring delivers the goods.
2038;I'd go so far as to say that Rings is a far better work than The Ring Two in its entirety.
2039;The Ring is still effective after all these years, even if none of us still have our old VHS players.
2040;ray does right by the film with solid presentation and a decent set of extras.
2041;This movie really truly scared me.
2042;I watched it twice, and even the second time it had me creeped out.
2043;Afterword it's the kind of movie that you have to think about, and talk about.
2044;And besides the general freakiness of it, it is an overall good movie.
2045;The acting is good, and it's a physcholigical thriller.
2046;The actors were very good for this movie.
2047;The premise looked great on paper, and the original Japanese flick was quite interesting.
2048;There are much better horror movies than this.
2049;The Ring is an engrossing horror movie that will have you at the edge of your seats from beginning to end.
2050;I think they could have made it quite a bit more complicated as the director Gore Verbinski could have done a better job, but however it was very entertaining and well done.
2051;When you usually hear about these kinds of horror movies, you do not really expect the acting/script to be that great, just the special effects/how much it scares you.
2052;They even did a good job with Aidan and the way that he acted and talked.
2053;Ahhh, definetetly one of the best parts of the movie has to be the special effects.
2054;the actual video tape in The Ring is very scary, how it is acted.
2055;in conclusion, Gore Verbinski and all of the actors sure succeeded in putting together and masterpiece and one of a kind horror movie.
2056;I found myself on the edge of my seat from the chilling opening scene right up until the mind bending conclusion.
2057;this is in my humble opinion, the best horror film to be released in at least 10 years.
2058;What makes this an extremely effective horror film is this: it's rated PG.13.
2059;The cast is excellent (I think Naomi Watts is one of the best actresses in movies these days) and the direction is tight and driven.
2060;This is a superb horror film that is as good or better than its Japanese original.
2061;This move is filled with atmosphere and tension that keeps building up as the mystery of the ring is revealed.
2062;Naomi Watts is excellent as the main character, a reporter named Rachel Keller.
2063;This is probably the best horror movie to have come out in literally years, with the possible exception of some of M. Night Shyamalan's.
2064;Actually on a scale of 1 to 5 This deserves a 100.
2065;It is the most amazing movie I have ever seen.
2066;It has a very solid story that is very chilling and unlike any other horror movie out there.
2067;After seeing it I bought the Japanese version Ring 1, Ring 2 and Ring 0 which are all very good also but the american one just has much more to it to hold it together more and tell more of the story it is very cool and the end is very chilling.
2068;This is a must for every person who loves watching creepy movies.
2069;adapted from the 1998 Japanese classic Ringu, screenwriter Ehren Kruger continues his success after films such as Arlington Road and the Scream series with this incredibly edgy, taught thriller.
2070;Director Gore Verbinksi (no pun intended) is a hidden gem with this film before his supreme success with The Pirates of the Caribbean series.
2071;an excellent, intelligent screenplay by Kruger is projected onto the big screen in a deliciously scary manner.
2072;Watts is very strong in the starring role, showing some cinematic range and displaying a set of lungs that may end up rivaling none other than Jamie Lee Curtis.
2073;minded, and ridiculous horror films, The Ring shines above the rest as a solid adventure into a new scope of the genre and succeeds mightily due to its superb direction and cinematography.
2074;One of the best horror films of the decade thus far.
2075;It made me think, great, the world is coming to an end, satan has arrived and is taken on the identity of Samara .
2076;it is yet another example of the film industry's decline.
2077;m. Night Shyamalen (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs) seems to be the only director capable of making a first class thriller these days.
2078;That's what this wants to be, and it succeeds.
2079;It succeeds in scaring, in entertaining and providing some good visuals along the way.
2080;If you like ghost stories and don't want to be treated like a child for doing so, this is a fine example of what a good scary film can be.
2081;And at least one marvelous ambiguity: the young girl's speech to the psychiatrist.
2082;That pretense and ambiguity makes the film worth watching over, more than once.
2083;It does hang together and the pieces fit.
2084;That way you get to see two good scary movies and you can kick off some pretty interesting literary discussions as well.
2085;the Others is a similar type of suspense hurror movie which is much, much better.
2086;I won't get into the specifics, but this movie will give a couple of good jolts and you'll maybe endure tinkle time!
2087;Avoid Fear Dot Com at all costs and watch this instead.
2088;but it's well worth the effort.
2089;The images from the tape are deeply disturbing, especially when all is revealed by the equally chilling story behind it.
2090;the VerdictThere is a definite visual flair to the makeup of The Ring by the ex.
2091;The original is quieter, self.
2092;I love Japanese horror films and I think this version was a great interpretation.
2093;View it sometime and see what you think.
2094;As the movie went on I was able to make the connections.
2095;But I knew the ending way into the movie.
2096;Just please, dont listen to all these other people who say it was a good movie.
2097;Use you good judgement and use your time for something else.
2098;the Ring was both suspenseful and visually stunning.
2099;If you want a good scare, see The Ring!
2100;The Ring is a story about supernatural evil, therefore, it IS a horror film, done very much in the style of the psycological thriller.
2101;Horror is a bit like comedy, either it works for you, (by making you laugh, or scaring you, depending on which genre we are talking about,) or it doesn't.
2102;It varies from person to person, simple as that.
2103;perhaps what I thought was greatest about The Ring was that it seemed to strike a perfect balance between coherence and ambiguity, as well as onscreen and offscreen visuals.
2104;I loved that, while watching the film in the theater, I, at first, thought that it would that certain cliched ending that we've seen a million times, but that it then went off in another direction.
2105;Well, if you haven't, you should listen and listen well because it works like a survival guide in this static empire we call entertainment.
2106;Everything seems to be perfect, too, until something happens.
2107;as far as the mingling dread and cinematic visions goes, The Ring was an impressively crafted blanket of both moods and ideas, forging a tale around a haunting legend about what happens when evil truly has a tale to tell.
2108;It isn't a table set with little creatures eerily yelling boo every now and again either, but is instead a work that manifests itself as one piece, coming together to leave a chilling impression in the spine of those who watch it.
2109;This is furthered by a cast that is actually believable, a feat in and of itself in modern movies, and by the fact that this is not a movie with a happy ending.
2110;(And the short piece included is like this as well, making it all the more frightening when the exclamation point is added to that retelling).
2111;Still, turning off the lights and sitting in the darkness, letting the little chills walking the stairwell of your back, works well with this piece because it has the ability to be haunting.
2112;The Ring is an excellent, creepy horror movie.
2113;Along with 'The Others', its the scariest movie I've seen in decades.
2114;It actually has a good plot, with a Hitchcockian mystery and family secrets layered on top of terror.
2115;Sad and touching at times, always unsettling, this is a haunting movie with almost unbearable tension.
2116;Her ability to burn images into film is also mentioned in the interview sequence.
2117;And at that point, she's still slightly skeptical about the tape.
2118;its fairly clear at the end .
2119;I definitely thought this was the most frightening movie I've ever seen.
2120;This message of impending doom is eerily spoken by a young girl's voice in a telephone call that rings immediately after the tape is watched.
2121;She discovers the urban legend and the tape surrounding it.
2122;What follows is a masterpiece of thrills and scares that have been so artfully done by the cinematographers, director, musical composer, and all those involved in the creation of this movie, that I think it should be a classic.
2123;This scene is worth the movie alone, even if the rest of the film was more subtle and not as bone chilling, it would be worth it just for this piece of film making.
2124;Rachel is on a race to get to the bottom of this because not only she, but now her young son, has accidentally viewed the tape.
2125;Her son is a boy that Samara talks to and gives some visions.
2126;She never really died, except physically, and she uses the most common medium of our culture to send her deadly message.
2127;As a child, she could only send these images in drawings and in her mind, but after death, she found a more perfect and widespread way to get her message across.
2128;You will never want to be alone with a television again after watching this engrossing and bone chilling film.
2129;The Ring does it's job and does it better than most.
2130;It's a good old fashioned ghost story with a modern twist.
2131;The film is well acted and beautifully shot and has some genuine scares, despite the some holes in the story.
2132;Take a shaky premise and hire a decent cinematographer and a great editor and you a better than average genre piece.
2133;Be wary of taking at the film for more than it is and just let it entertain you.
2134;Also a short film that bears signifigance after watching the feature which I can promise a slumber party will eat up.
2135;If what scares you is an axe.
2136;But if you like a good, freaky mystery.
2137;if you've got a brain and can put two and two together.
2138;if eerie people and scenery and symbols and events give you a thrill, The Ring is guaranteed to scare you.
2139;The Ring is the scariest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen alot.
2140;It's a psychological thriller and scary movie and mystery in one.
2141;There are symbols and clues and some VERY freaky moments.
2142;This movie was very well.
2143;made and it's a great story.
2144;Right from the beginning you've got scariness.
2145;i did enjoy The Ring immensely.
2146;I've got an open mind.
2147;Next, great image of a girl who gets scared to death.
2148;What really insulted my intelligence was the pretension of the film makers.
2149;Did anyone else notice VIDEODROME?Even though flicks in this genre hardly ever have one, a decent payoff is in order.
2150;It's one of the best to come out in the genre in a long while.
2151;I've often said, I like my scary movies to be acted by actors who take the plot seriously.
2152;This has all the ingredients for a good scare: moodiness, rain, good old fashioned creepiness and more.
2153;anyway, watch this in the dark!
2154;I love horror films and have seen many, new and old.
2155;They are probably both pretty intense.
2156;The look of the film is one of foreboding.
2157;I think the soundtrack has something to do with that as well.
2158;Whoever scored the film did a great job in setting the atmosphere.
2159;Its more of a suspense thriller.
2160;Though it freaked me out, I still loved it, and have actually seen it more than once.
2161;I dont get it some peaple are saying this movie delievers a spook, i gotta admit a lil tiny one, but I didnt find this scary at all, its not all that great.
2162;This is one of my favorite movies, it captures the audiences attention.
2163;Samara is haunting and intense, she steals the entire movie.
2164;When this came out the first thing I heard s that this is the most frightening movie within the past 10 years.
2165;She ends up finding the tape and watching it.
2166;I also got the feeling that it was released shortly after Fear Dot Com because in many ways the two movies were similar.
2167;Great for Teenage Girls Sleepovers that get them afraid.
2168;I'm so sick of hearing around every corner that this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life!
2169;The movie probably has 1 or 2 big scary moments, but that's it.
2170;Overall, it's more of a mystery (and an interesting and mildly disturbing one at that) than a horror flick.
2171;If you want to watch a good movie that makes you think and keeps you on the edge of your seat, check this out because, as I stated before, it is a v. good film, but if you're a horror buff and just want some genuine spine.
2172;I love this movie and I have loved it for about 5 years and I finally have it so I can watch it anytime and any day!
2173;It's rlly creepy and very intriguing!
2174;I like a good horror flick.
2175;It makes you jump of your seat.
2176;But it's so very good, you will want to watch it again and again and again.
2177;Just like my title says, it's one the best horror movies I have ever seen.
2178;A lot of people said that The Ring was scary and or had some scary parts and was excited to watch it.
2179;Verbinski did an incredible job with his filming style, a way that really allows the dark, disturbing imagery of the movie to get under your skin and stay there.
2180;in addition, the way that this movie sets you up, and then hits you with terror is done extremely well.
2181;The film hits you from all angles with scenes and plot twists that you will never see coming and will make you jump in your seat from time to time.
2182;It's almost surreal how much the movie can affect you.
2183;soapbox>As a side note, I firmly believe that people go to movies to be entertained and to be drawn into the film itself.
2184;A movie that does this can and will succeed.
2185;/soapbox>The acting is done very well, with Naomi Watts in particular.
2186;She is very believable as not only a determined reporter, but a caring mother and jaded lover.
2187;Finally, David Dorfman does an outstanding job as the aloof, almost psychic son of Naomi Watts' character.
2188;The Ring is a ride you won't soon forget.
2189;Gore Verbinski's classy remake of the 1998 Japanese film Ringu packs quite a few chills, thrills and a few spills into a solid creepfest.
2190;There's always unanswered questions in the best thrillers (Kubrick's much maligned The Shining or Freidkin's The Exorcist are two good examples).
2191;She decides to investigate and watches it herself in the process.
2192;In the process, she unwittingly opens up a supernatural pandora's box.
2193;the jumpy editing, spooky cinematography and strong performances all enhance the film making it almost a sequel to the original Japanese classic.
2194;Instead, it focuses on the suspense angle.
2195;there are a number of unexpected twists and turns along the way (don't let anybody tell you anything beyond the plot description)that remind us what good films terror films (as Boris Karloff called them) are all about.
2196;the extras include a number of trailers including the trailer for Catch Me If You Can, Ringu and a short film by the director that provides additional clues as to the heart of the mystery.
2197;She is compelled to look into it further when she learns that three other teenagers all died mysteriously on the same night and at the same time as Katie.
2198;tHE RING is a good supernatural thriller and an improvement on the Japanese original, RINGU.
2199;Director Verbinski demonstrates that he knows how to raise the hairs on the back of your neck.
2200;The story is told from Rachel's point of view and she brings the appropriate skepticism about the allegedly cursed video tape.
2201;Watts plays the character with intelligence and just the right level of fear to be believable.
2202;It's got creepy scares, it's got suspence, and it's got a mystery.
2203;It also has a few other things going for it.
2204;It also has a story that will make it fun for repeat viewings.
2205;it's a fun movie and definately worth having around the house for a scary movie night.
2206;Not only is she very beautiful but she's a wonderful actress as well.
2207;One of the things i liked about this movie is that you actually don't completely understand the storyline until the very last moment which will keep you on your seat till the end of the movie.
2208;Definitely one of the best Horror films in recent years besides The blair witch project .
2209;shot, faithful to the original film, Ringu, which they copied almost shot by shot.
2210;Naomi Watts is a great up.
2211;coming actress, and absolutely stunning on.
2212;The film has a creepy way of drawing the viewer into the story as it unfolds.
2213;In any case, be prepared for a ride!
2214;This one utilizes a far deeper, more elementalfear: madness, children, rejection leading to revenge, and supernatural pre and post grave powers.
2215;This is perhaps one of the greatest horror flicks of the new millenium.
2216;There are even parts on the killer video tape that fit together.
2217;She never sleeps because the horses keep her up at night.
2218;There is a specific part where you see something like a black cloth or something flicking past the screen really fast.
2219;I watch it every time I see it on cable and I don't care what part its at.
2220;Worth watching and the best movie of 2002
2221;A remake of the Japanese movie Ringu, the Ring is a surprisingly effective horror flick.
2222;I got more than my share of chills while watching this movie.
2223;The subdued colors of the rainy Seattle days look great.
2224;I have seen criticism of this extra, but I though it was quite well put together.
2225;the movie is far from perfect, but all in all, the Ring is full of enough frights to recommend to horror fans.
2226;The Ring is a psychological horror film from 2002, an American remake of the 1998 Japanese film Ringu, which in turn was based on the 1991 book.
2227;She starts to sense that the curse is real and tries to find the answer.
2228;shot mostly in Washington state (with some parts in Oregon and California), The Ring is a polished film with a nice, haunting vibe, which can be attributed to the excellent cinematography, the thick forests and constant rain.
2229;Watts and Martin Henderson are worthy protagonists as well.
2230;I'll do that the next time I watch the film.
2231;another positive is that the ghostly element is actually rather chilling.
2232;The Ring effectively changes this and makes the apparition frightful.
2233;this is certainly an exception to the rule.
2234;genuinely creepy in parts (though I thought the final scene was pulled off with more creepy effect in the original Japanese version), I was skeptical, but I thought The Ring to be enjoyable and it darn near freaked my wife out of her wits.
2235;The Ring still sends chills down your spine, even after it's much anticipated sequel.
2236;The Ring (an adaptation of the Japanese Ringu) brings that cinematic style over here.
2237;face scare scenes, this oblique style proves to be even more terrifying.
2238;The Ring is also an exercise in the cerebral.
2239;I love this scary movie and was glad to get it on Blu.
2240;both were very good movies.
2241;I liked the blair witch project too.
2242;I love naomi watss in this, she's in alot of good films.
2243;this film has good pacing and I love the way it's filmed, the colours and style.
2244;Plus it's a good story and for the year it was released, it aged well and still a movie you can watch many times.
