1;Many professional critics have said that the new Manchurian Candidate is a successful remake of the classic.
2;The remake is still a good movie, but it is by no means comparable to the original film.
3;In the original the mind.
4;But in the original, this corniness has a similar charm to the old Twilight Zone.
5;soviet empire of the early Cold War with a powerful conglomerate.
6;Sergeant Raymond Shaw won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle.
7;Marco meets Eugen e Rose on the train to New York city.
8;Will friendship trump sworn duty?
9;There is another meeting between Shaw and Marco.
10;But it is good enough if you never saw the 1962 film or read the novel by Richard Condon.
11;Was the personality of Elly based on a well.
12;The original version of this movie is one of my all.
13;It was one of the most thrilling movies of all time, sure, but it showed a true mastery of the medium: the pace of the movie, by and large, is slow, but it creates such an unforgettable atmosphere of dread and paranoia that you had your eyes glued to the screen for every second.
14;The original Manchurian Candidate was excellently written and acted, and really funny.
15;it really holds up after 40 years.
16;don't get me wrong, the acting is superb.
17;Denzel is in top form, cast against type, playing the Sinatra role in a considerably more haunted manner than the Chairman did.
18;Liev Schreiber channels Lawrence Harvey and proves capable of taking over Harvey's classic performance.
19;Meryl Streep, it goes without saying, is great.
20;Jon Voight, though, gives probably the most balanced performance of the film, as a Senator who has to juggle idealism with pragmatism learned by hard experience.
21;it's quite an accomplishment, and rings true in this age of the 'axis of evil'.
22;If you haven't seen the original, you might imagine that this is a smart, satirical political thriller.
23;It's a tall order to remake one of the best American.
24;little of what made the original film special is present here.
25;level atrocities, the humor is replaced with such grimness that the movie draws you in easily, but it is hard to enjoy.
26;The message of political assassination for promotion is still provocative, since many people still believe that LBJ was in on the JFK assassination.
27;To paraphrase Pauline Kael, that movie has some of the most sophisticated political satire ever committed to the screen.
28;The new movie has some of the most obvious political satire ever committed to the screen: Corporations want more power?
29;I take a more optimistic picture of our government than the movie does, so its dripping cynicism doesn't quite hit home for me.
30;shot remake of the original, but this movie shows how hard it is to recreate a classic movie that's just as memorable.
31;I'd sure go to see that one, and I do trust film executives to come up with a movie that's better than one of the worst of all time, but not much more.
32;For those of you who are reading this I know you will know what the movie is about and it is very important, but disturbing.
33;Watch it during the day and have time to talk afterwards.
34;If you are reading reviews I am sure you will love it.
35;We enjoyed trying to figure out what was going on in this story.
36;It kept us guessing but satisfied in the end.
37;Demme, in my opinion, is the king of suspense.
38;He takes something so simple and fuels it with suspense and horror, and it's only heightened by the fact that it appears the characters are looking directly at us.
39;But alas, even the fine actors and wonderful Demme couldn't save this film.
40;Washington is very effective in the role of the shaken Capt. Bennett Marco.
41;in the end, this is still a good film and deserving of certain praise if for nothing more than the brilliance in which Meryl Streep portrays the insanely evil Sen. Ellie Shaw, a movie villain of the utmost stature.
42;The Manchurian Candidate is a paranoid political thriller that engrosses you in its plot of intrigue.
43;I have yet to see the original, but the film should be reviewed on its own merits,and this candidate delivers.
44;While the movie is not the master piece I was hoping for, it had me on the edge of my seat, especially in the last thirty minutes.
45;Denzel Washington puts in yet another captivating performance as a man who is so mentally screwed up and haunted by his dreams, that he refuss to sleep or clean his apartment.
46;This may turn off a few moviegoers, but it is worth it for the last thirty minutes, when you are on the edge of your seat and wondering what is going to happen next.
47;Denzel Washington is turning out to be one of the most gifted character actors in film today but he better look out.
48;kilter character so well in this film ( and Man on Fire) he need to watch out not to start getting too typecast lest he turn into another Bruce Dern .
49;But anyway onto the point of the film.
50;the always obvious question is whether a particular remake is as good as the first one.
51;seat thriller well folks this does qualify.
52;Bravo Denzel!I though the film was well directed and well scripted.
53;In fact it might be essential since the suspense part works so well in this movie.
54;I though Demme did an excellent job laying it out.
55;I like that they now have vehicle to show a wonderful story to a whole new generation or two in an updated context that they can relate to.
56;I think that is an important point and key to fully understanding her motivations.
57;obsession to her son along with a few other desires.
58;Yes it is subtle, but subtle is often best.
59;Watch it again and look at the non.
60;Subtle and intense at the same time.
61;anyway for all that I though this film was a worthy remake although probably not as good as the original, but worthy indeed.
62;"i recommend it to any thriller fan or fans wanting to introduce their children to the Mancurian Candidate without the ""But, he Chinese are our friends, they'd mever do that"", comments."
63;This is that rare remake of a classic movie which actually improves on the original.
64;Jonathan Demme, a moderately famous but greatly underrated directing talent, weaves an unnerving and spidery tapestry that chillingly illustrates the enigmatic and duplicitous times we live in.
65;realistic potrayal of how people in today's propaganda.
66;As always, Denzel Washington provides a top performance in this updated remake of 1962, Cold War Classic.
67;Pretty good as remakes of great films go.
68;This is the first time I've ever seen a remake that was as good as the original.
69;Even with changes that updated the plot they managed to make it just as good as and at some points I thought it might even be a smidgen better than the original.
70;Denzel Washington is pretty good in this remake of the Sinatra thriller brought up to date for a modern audience.
71;Comparing this to the original (for those who have seen it) is interesting for the similarities.
72;Both movies paint their villians well as almost insidious and faceless power figures, or puppet masters working behind the scenes, and ultimately wielding all the power, and if one had too choose, this version is probably more believable on paper.
73;Jon Voight has a nice Cameo as Senator Thomas Jordan who helps Marco, and one or two red herrings and twists help the picture hold your attention.
74;Holy mackerel this was good.
75;Probably one of Denzel's best performances and that is saying a lot.
76;Someone recommended this movie to me because I like to read about conspiracy theories.
77;The big surprise in this move was staggering, kind of like the first time I watched the Matrix and he eats the magic pills.
78;Suddenly, a whole new world opens up to you.
79;The storyline was great and Meryl Streep was superb as the determined politician.
80;Her speech she gives to the leaders of the political party was powerful stuff.
81;The Manchurian Candidate is a great movie and I want to see the original now and see if it's anywhere near as good as this one.
82;A great script, wonderful actors, superbly directed and filmed.
83;You got all the thrills of a good action movie but on top of that there is this heart.
84;Oh, it still works just fine, but in only a few scenes did I find myself comparing it back to the original one.
85;Her tirade directly at fellow party members who initially reject making her son the VP nominee is classic.

89;"top ""convention"" climax, when the two candidates come out to face the crowd."
90;this movie isn't just a thriller with elements of a modern MK.
91;"If you liked the final explanation/twist about what happened in 'Nam in ""Jacob's Ladder,"" this is right up your alley."
92;I picked up the Manchurian Candidate because Denzel Washington always delivers a watchable performance and because of the history of the original film.
93;seat suspense that the original '62 picture had.
94;Everyone has to keep up with the times, I suppose.
95;The most entertaining things are the plot twists at the end, where you don't really know what's going to happen next .
96;and Mr. Washington does keep you on the edge of your seat.
97;I'm sure they will enjoy it more than I.
98;"It seemed practically blasphemous to take a movie as good, as shocking and as original as the Frankenheimer classic and turn it into some ""Charade""."
99;"The Manchurian Candidate is Demme's best film since ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" and this remake still has the power to shock and impress, combining the same old twists with some startling new ones."
100;Knowing the original as well as I do, I was still on the edge of my seat at the end of this one, and I left the theater thoroughly satisfied.
101;character of Raymond Shaw onto Marco, allowing for all sorts of new twists.
102;I was getting tugged on multiple sides when I decided to rate and review this film.
103;First, and most obviously, was that I loved the original with Frank Sinatra.
104;Not great, not the best of the year, but good enough to hold my attention and keep me up later than I normally would be.
105;He comes back to the States and is swept into politics.
106;"Mrs. Streep plays probably her most creepy role to date
107;Her character infuriated me one moment, and then made my stomach turn the next.
108;This is one of Denzel Washington's best movies.
109;This is intense and worry somestory.
110;If we do this to top members of congress then , that is messed up.
111;the movie is creative and can make you ask the question , what if ?
112;another feather in Demme's cap!Washington is great, as usual.
113;Great movie and it wouldn't surprise me if this really goes on aka RFK assassination.
114;Highly recommended and a must watch
115;that by the time you see it in the theater, you feel as if you have already seen it.
116;makes are made of good movies.
117;Good movies are good, so why try to re.
118;make them . . . I always enjoyed the Sinatra/Harvey original, which was crisp, credible, and where one can identify with the characters, and have feelings for them.
119;How they can get into and out of the minds of the protagonists is kept well into the shadows, with little explanation.
120;It only made me want to see the original again, which was a real classic.
121;The surviving members of the patrol are carefully programmed to believe that one of their members, the son of a powerful politician, acted heroically to save their lives.
122;The movie has such a great story line, acting and ideas.
123;But now after seeing the new version, I am pleasantly surprised of how good of a job Johnathan Demme did with handling a classic.
124;this version takes place after the first Gulf War and I believe that the movie is in 2004.
125;Raymond Shaw, who has won a Medal of Honor for his actions in the Gulf War, gets into politics and gets put on a ticket as the Vice.
126;washed and can still be controlled.
127;Great performances all around by Washington and Meryl Streep.
128;Streep will probably get an Oscar nomination for this performance.
129;Liev Schreiber does a good job as Raymond Shaw.
130;I would highly recommend that you do yourself a favor and see both versions of the movie.
131;Strangely enough, when the movie started, I found myself there.
132;Meryl Streep did an outstanding job filling Angela Landsbury's shoes.
133;Not to mention, the movie did a fantastic job of portraying the realism in cutthroat, no mercy, do anything to win election poltics.
134;The pace was perfect, especially for the movie length.
135;Things moved along quickly and it was never boring.
136;i have not seen the original Manchurian Candidate, but I feel this movie was very well done and is rather above average for a remake.
137;Typically a remake is pretty disappointing and a mere shadow of the original, but this is a solid movie.
138;He gave a fantastic performance, as did Liev.
139;I would highly recommend this movie, particularly if you are already inclined toward political thrillers.
140;In any case, the performances are strong including an enjoyable outtake of Meryl Streep talking about her ambitions for her son.
141;I recommend it because I enjoy Liev Schreiber but don't expect an excellent movie, just excellent but brief performances.
142;Even though it is a remake, it is worthwhile.
143;Great plot and character development.
144;Doing a remake of a first class movie is asking for it.
145;Even so, it's a solid movie in my view with a nice twist on the original.
146;Lansbury's kiss on her son's lips created, for me, a """"Whoa, wait a minute"""" moment."""
147;the remake, for me, teetered more into relationships, with Washington more dominant in the movie, with Schreiber next and being more sympathetic and likeable, and with Streep being less poisonous and much funnier.
148;I thought the original ending, with Raymond's death and Sinatra speaking what Raymond's real medal of honor citation could have been, had a lot of emotional power.
149;But the guy is a powerhouse stage actor who can handle anything from Shakespeare to Pinter, and regularly does.
150;He's an actor to keep an eye on.
151;and while I think Meryl Streep's performance keeps the movie a bit off balance (its such a showboating turn), she genuinely is repellant, funny and scary all at the same time.
152;It's a good read, and made a good movie.
153;Do they think the name of the old movie is so powerful that it will have its own audience?The production values of this new movie are much richer than the original black and white.
154;Also, this version has fabulous actors giving exceptional performances.
155;In this version, Meryl Streep is a powerful and cut throat senator who wants to extend her family dynasty through her son.
156;This version sits absolutely in our time and culture and this forces many changes from the 1962 version.
157;and the director, Johnathan Demme, does make interesting changes to the plot that in some cases improve the drama of the original.
158;This was a brilliant coup in the first movie that is missing here.
159;wide communism of Korea, China, and the USSR (doe the kids today even know that name?)
160;And this presents a special burden to this remake.
161;Yes, it is about political usurpation as well.
162;But it is the weaving together of these two real yet unreal worlds that works the magic.
163;You can enjoy the first version without believing in the existence of a powerful global communist conspiracy and you can enjoy this version without believing in all encompassing corporate power stealing our freedoms.
164;(Of course, each of these villains was the perfect psychological foil for its time.)
165;This is an effective thriller.
166;I like some things better in each of the versions, but both are very good and Denzel Washington is terrific as is the rest of the cast.
167;acted and 21st century acceptable, but somehow not compelling.
168;The original is so much more meaningful (and much truer to the book).
169;I'm surprised Denzel Washington agreed to play the part of Marco if he had read the book or seen the original movie.
170;Still, it's worth watching, i guess.
171;secret patrol deep inside Iraqi.
172;pretty dismal that with all that talent on.
173;our careers, manor homes, Bentleys, family, fortune, freedom.
174;it's stylish, sleek, techno, suitably paranoid and edgy.
175;It's got Denzel Washington totally owning the Ben Marco role and making it his own, right down to grinding teeth and bulging, terrified eyes.
176;Think about it this way: you manage to dig an electronic implant out of your back, proof, finally, that there's something to these night terrors after all.
177;The original was the truly gripping version.
178;Both Angela Lansbury in the original and Meryl Streep in the remake are convincing in that role.
179;the setting and relationship between the characters is much better in the original.
180;There, a braiwashed son of a senator and his wife is programmed to do what is necessary to help his father, the vice presidential candidate rise to the top.
181;That's really believable, that a zombied out brainwashed, unlikabe cad could actually be a candidate for vice president.
182;Trust me, however, the ending works much better in the original.
183;Like the original, complicated requiring close attention to follow.
184;Some slow parts, boffo ending worth the effort.
185;Just as exciting as the original with Gregory Peck and the mechanics of the brainwashing are done in a more believable fashion.
186;The original is one of the best films ever made.
187;It was creepy, foreboding, disturbing on political and emotional levels, and featured unassailable performances by very fine actors.
188;In the original, the audience just knew that Sinatra was telling the truth because Sinatra knew.
189;Demme zooms in and magnifies Washington's natural intensity, and you may find yourself backing away as Washington speaks, as if he might touch you from the screen.
190;liv Schreiber as Raymond Shaw is excellent.
191;Demme shines a brighter, harsher light on Raymond's past.
192;Schreiber is more active in his redemption, but he's still very much Macbeth.
193;She absolutely deserves a nod for Best Supporting Actress.
194;"fashioned way"" a la the original."
195;This is an excellent movie and Denzell Washington is at his best again.
196;the story line is seat gripping.
197;Washington is excellent but changing the plot and making the chief character to be a politician drains the film of whatever suspense and tension the original did have.
198;"Washington may be a better actor than Sinatra yet the original contains proof that Frank was a fine film actor (also check out ""Man with the Golden Arm"" to verify this!)"
199;The new one is definitely an improvement.
200;Wasn't he a singer or something?In any event, i went to see this movie last week in a theatre and had a great time.
201;It was paranoid, dark, and very well put together.
202;The music was creepy and tense, the acting was spectacular and the premise, despite what others have written in here, was believable enough in the context of the film to keep me interested.
203;what I liked:The 'reality' of the film is a spoof of modern American politics.
204;No one goes around attacking the Lord of the Rings for being 'unbelievable', but people enjoy it nonetheless.
205;for me, the premise that a corporation has put a sleeper in the White House is a perfectly good one.
206;And corporations have lots of that.
207;so, the acting was great, i thought the story flowed well with some decent twists thrown in, and even though i saw the original film, i wasn't sure how it would end.
208;I really enjoy the old government conspiracy stuff.
209;Add in some mind control of the military and you got me sold!
210;Great performance as always by Denzel Washington, loved that I could watch it on Prime.
211;I will watch it again one day.
212;This summer thriller entitled The Manchurian Candidate is a really scary but also really well executed update of the 1960s original version of the novel.
213;Featuring a stellar cast of Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington, and Jon Voight.
214;Now he must convince his friend not to run for president of the United States but his mother is a power.
215;this movie is really chilling and really delivers the scares through it's suspenseful tone and the frightening portray of what it's like if criminal corporations actually brainwash their victims to cover.
216;The acting is superb by most and the directing is excellent.
217;One of the scenes was very hard to stomach however but overall, The Manchurian Candidate is a thriller worth seeing on the big screen.
218;guard, 1960s style cinematography, I really had to temper my criticism for this film remake.
219;The original is a landmark film, a timely incarnation more appropriate for release at the center of the Cold War when brainwashing soldiers and/or government officials was not met with as much cynical skepticism as it is today.
220;Having said that, this remake is actually a surprisingly professional creation with director Jonathan Demme at the helm.
221;"His best work remains ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and he continues with his penchant for close."
222;up full frame shots of peoples faces speaking directly into the camera as if the audience as a whole comprised the character being spoken to.
223;He is a good director but all directors have their trademark signatures.
224;I will place a significant wager that she will receive yet another Oscar nomination for her reprise of the now infamous Angela Lansbury performance of a conniving, power hungry, manipulative Arch Angel protectorate who will see her son reach the height of political power at any cost.
225;She has many outstanding moments.
226;If you have not seen the original then this film might seem inspired, albeit sometimes incredible to entertain.
227;The original version is oftentimes mesmerizing and highly inventive, while this updated version is professional and caters to a more modern audience.
228;I was able to attend a pre.
229;Denzel delivers a superd performance as Ben Marco, while Meryl Streep provides an outstanding supporting effort as the sadistic mother, Eleanor Shaw.
230;The plot twists and turns throughout the film, leaving the viewer on the edge of his/her seat until the very end, which if I may say so, was surprisingly good.
231;I can at least guarantee you'll love one of them.
232;"1962's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was an outstanding classic of an earlier era of movies, crisply shot in black and white and featuring a talented cast and a tightly wound, haunting plot firmly embedded in the tensions and paranoia of the Cold War."
233;The Manchurian Candidate has a good build.
234;"2004's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" may well be a perfectly acceptable movie for someone who had never seen the original."
235;For those who saw and appreciated the original, this remake is a missed opportunity, worth a look mostly for the outstanding cast.
236;This is a great movie and i think it`s even better than the original Sinatra 1962 movie.
237;It could very well be based on a true story too.
238;I never saw the original, but thisremake is really good!
239;The actingall around was impressive, and thestory was great.
240;The Manchurian Candidate remake provides a great story line and the original provides a great precedent, they even have a great cast of seasoned actors and stars.
241;With terrorism and civil liberties under threat this should be a lively discussion.
242;denzel Washington is perfectly cast as a man of integrity and courage who embarks on a one.
243;Washington's intensity and anger make his character the most credible in the movie.
244;Shaw won the Congressional Medal of Honor and came home a war hero.
245;He is now taking the country by storm as a good looking and charismatic candidate for Vice President of the United States.
246;She plays an ambitious, smothering, and manipulative woman with an unhealthy attachment to her son.
247;Its only saving grace is Denzel Washington's memorable performance as an anguished soldier who is torn apart by forces that he cannot control.
248;fast service and the movie came in a case!!!
249;I think this is a fabulous film and have seen it multiple times.
250;It has a lot of ties to the political realities of your time.
251;I found the movie riveting from the very opening scene and was totally wrapped up in it until the very end.
252;The first version with Frank Sinatra was okay, and I think he did a good job, but there's no contest when comparing the original with this superb film, as far as I'm concerned.
253;denzel's such a fine actor, so convincing, so gripping.
254;And NONE of them constitute an improvement.
255;"director Jonathan Demme does his best to keep the film entertaining for the apolitical with his snazziest directing since ""The Silence of the Lambs""."
256;this film is blessed with an incredible cast.
257;Denzel Washington gives one of the most compelling performances of his career as Ben Marco.
258;Washington manages to hold his own against constant comparison to Frank Sinatra's portrayal of Marco in the original.
259;The fear Washington's Marco is feeling washes over the audience and kept everyone on the edge of their seats.
260;The Manchurian Candidate is a smart contemporary film that takes familiar genre conventions and gives them a reasonably intelligent spin.

265;together hallucination and memory was done magnificently well, and the portrayal of people who can feel their minds betraying them was admirably credible and also respectful.

268;The political importance of The Manchurian Candidate, a movie based on the novel written by Richard Condon, is excellent because it teaches us how power corrupts and absolute power has the ability to corrupt people, process and society absolutely.

272;The mother's role is masterfully played by Meryl Streep, now a Senior Senator who took over the vacant seat left by her husband.
273;As with the first version, this movie is simply a magnificent political thriller, don't miss it!
274;If you like small, but very cool actors' performances, this is excellent for her performance and, to some extent, Liev Schreiber's.
275;"A star, yes
276;This is a riveting and provocative remake by a top.

278;The original with Frank Sinatra may very well have been controversial and its plot far.

280;With its stellar cast .
281;the brilliant Meryl Streep and the always reliable Denzel Washington .
282;this film delivers precisely the same merits.
283;Streep's performance as a smarmy, power.
284;obsessed US senator bent on advancing her son's political career is so convincing as to induce chills, while Denzel never once flinches as a disturbingly paranoid victim of US intelligence abuses.
285;Fueled largely by the hysterical climate of fear and terror we now live in, his portrayal of contemporary American life is thoroughly convincing and lends credence to its premise: a government conspiracy to plant a privately.
286;but whether or not this conspiracy theory resonates, the human problems the film presents are as believable as they are engaging.
287;These are the situations Demme explores in his admirable attempt to endear a very jaded audience to the adventurous claims of a sci.
288;Lastly, the theory of government efforts to hypnotize and program people is actually a well.
289;I think films capable of inducing such strong response are becoming rarer by the year, and that this one qualifies as just such a film ought to be reason enough to give it a chance.
290;I thought this adaptation of the book was well done and enjoyed Denzel's performance.
291;Anyone who is a fan of House of Cards would enjoy this.
292;I enjoyed the science fiction aspect of this film as well as the political.

297;demme and company hold our interest throughout and couple of hours whiz right by, thoroughly entertaining and, at times, appropriately chilling.
298;THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a fast paced, tension riddled, timely, well.

302;"and that is a good thing, just not monumental
303;But given the absence of these values, this CANDIDATE is worth your time as it touts some wonderful performances.
304;I think a better movie could have been made, in the sense of being more believable and a more convincing critique of corporate power and the military/industrial complex.
305;And I would see the parallax view if you are into this kind of movies.
306;Washington and Liev Schrieber give Oscar calibre performances with Streep outstanding as a ruthless incestuos mother bent on world domination.
307;The film has sophisticated cinematography in creating a sense of paranoia.
308;The score creates a mood of fear.
309;It's an extremely well crafted film with a nice small role by Bruno Ganz.
310;Not a masterpiece as John Frankenheimre's original.
311;Still Demme has made an intelligent movie out of an original classic.
312;The following may contain """"spoilers""""First of all Denzel Washington and Jon Voight are excellent actors and always interesting to watch in their various roles."""
313;"As an example of the former you have ""12 Angry Men"" and of the latter ""Ocean's 11""."
314;It has some good things going for it, not the least of which is the acting.
315;Meryl Streep has to be the greatest actress of her generation and can do anything.
316;She is amazing here, particularly in her Oedipal scene with Liev Schreiber, who is also well cast.
317;Denzel Washington does a fine job as Major Marco and is convincing as a deeply troubled veteran of the gulf war.
318;But actors need a good script.
319;This one jerks and starts.
320;Although this film is neither in the league with Fahrenheit 9/11 nor the 1962 version, it is certainly worth seeing if only for the performance of the incomparable Ms. Streep.
321;Manchurian Candidate is closer to the original, at least in spirit, than might be expected.
322;One glimpse of black and white films stock, men in felt brim hats, and cinematic conventions from an earlier era, and most teenyboppers under the age of thirty grab for the remote.
323;Since they will only sit through a first run, it is good that they have one.

326;racial world commonly reflected on film now, vs the early 1960's.
327;the new film retains the acting strengths of the original.
328;Liev Schrieber's work is worthy of Laurence Harvey's original, a gut kicking performance, though Harvey still holds the edge.
329;Washington's craft is more than a match for Sinatra's unevenly inspired work.
330;Streep's scenery chewing is, frankly, perfect.
331;though the original is a classic.
332;so is this as excellent a film as the original, adjusting for the times in which each was made?
333;No, but it is a good film.
334;It hits in the right places, horrifies us with an incredibly cynical vision of what our nation is becoming, and yet it is offset by the thinnest sliver of a wild, earnest Patriotism.
335;That is a great, almost timeless movie.
336;i bought this 2004 movie because I loved the 1962 one so much.
337;I know that remakes normally are pretty crappy, but since I thought the 1962 movie was so great, I imagined that the 2004 version would at least be decent.
338;It has lots of twists and turns, keeps you guessing, and very good acting.
339;thinker, this is the movie for you.
340;I would recommend it to a friend and might watch it again.

342;"Angela Lansbury is so memorable in her role as ""Mrs. Iselin"", a very rare performance from Lansbury that it has never been duplicated."
343;the original black and white film was very effective in showing subliminal hypnotism and the film sucks you right into the storyline.
344;There is no mystery, suspense, wonder nor intense hypnotizing going on as it did in the first film.
345;The thrill is gone in this remake.
346;"There are no memorable characters in this version of ""The Manchurian Candidate."""

352;The movie had very good acting: Washington, Schreiber and Streep were all excellent.
353;The plot was tight and suspenseful.
354;The original was better, but this was a pretty good thriller on its own.
355;The original was more suspenseful and I cared more about the characters.
356;The remake has a nebulus corporate entity pulling the strings.
357;it is a good movie and the acting is very good.
358;The original Manchurian Candidate was measmerizing and intense.
359;If you have the chance, watch the original with Frank Sinatra and Lawrence Harvey.

361;This movie is showing us what is going on right now as we speak.
362;What if the Red Chinese, the Soviets, and the North Koreans had access to truly effective brainwashing and were using it to take control of the United States?From this brilliant novel was made one of the best Cold.
363;era movies ever made, 1962's The Manchurian Candidate, adapted for the screen by George Axelrod, directed by John Frankenheimer, and with a brilliant cast led by Frank Sinatra in his best screen performance, Lawrence Harvey, Janet Leigh, and Angela Lansbury as one of the most chilling movie villains ever.
364;I saw the original movie, and it was interesting to see the similarities and the differences.
365;Of course, Denzel did a very effective job of acting his character.
366;"The less research you do about ""The Manchurian Candidate"" the more you will enjoy it."

373;Great movie and great acting.
374;i came across this movie because so many articles deal with MK ULTRA projects from the Govt and they refer to this movie and I have to tell you this is very scary stuff.
375;I watched it again and you can tell by my review that I liked it this time.
376;The film is truly brilliant, it's got great cinematography, the acting is spectacular.
377;"academy Award Winning director Jonathan Demme (Best Director, ""The Silence of the Lambs."")"

379;After the enemy opened fire, Shaw saved the entire crew and won the medal of honor.
380;"One of the most entertaining films of 2004, see ""The Machurian Candidate""."
381;Meryl Steep and Denzel Washington are great, but how can you replace Angela Lansbury and Frank Sinatra?
382;Jonathan Demme is one of my favorite directors, but lately he's only doing remakes of superior films (he remade Charade as The Trouble with Charlie).
383;There are several key differences between this version and the original that mark the passage of time.
384;The good people at Manchurian Global make sure that their time with Ben Marco isn't wasted either.
385;in the end, this is a good movie .
386;You can watch it and enjoy it, but it will never replace the original.
387;It was a little difficult to follow at times but I really enjoyed it.
388;All the actors gave good performances and all should see this movie.
389;Shaw is constantly manipulated by his mother, played with conniving perfection by Meryl Streep.
390;There is some overkill in the plot and the intensity of the characters, but all in all this is a riveting movie which keeps the viewer guessing until all is revealed at the end.
391;The original is a political thriller about the communism scare during the Cold War.
392;The reason it's a classic is that the movie's plot delt with the possibilty that an outside evil could be controlling us, and the film also was telling the audience that communism is a government that will hypnotize you and your life, it was a message from the film makers.
393;While the answer to that question may be simple it also may be complex.
394;The original delt with communism, a very real threat at the time.
395;Denzel Washington gives a very convincing performance and it adds to the effect of the movie.
396;The acting was top notch overall and all that emotion was needed to keep the audience entertained.
397;Jonathan Demme also added to the tense atmosphere by using a lot of close.
398;Everytime an actor is delivering an emotional line the camera is always focused with the chin at the bottom of the screen and the top of the head at the top of the screen.
399;This forces the audience to focus in the actors' eyes to really get the emotion, but just the fact of having to force emotion to the audience shows that remaking a classic wasn't easy.
400;This modern version is no match for the original classic, and even though the original may have lost its touch due to the passing of communistic fears it still holds the values that make it way better than this modern tale.
401;This was a great movie with an interesting plot.
402;I really enjoyed this movie.
403;It was powerful and it easily kept my attention.
404;Excellent performances by Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, and Liev Schreiber.
405;mind control is the order of the day and these orders have Denzel and Liev in their clutches.
406;powerful men and Meryl Streep, a Hillary Clinton look.
407;So it's up to him to save the civilized world from political anarchist.
408;communism is transformed into anti.
409;good earnest stuff from Johnathan Demme, but it just does not cut it when placed against the original version.
410;on its own terms, the film works as a solid thriller, but the director is Johnathan Demme who is in the top class of thriller directors.
411;I love the Sinatra version of this movie and I also love Denzel, so I had high hopes for the remake.
412;Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role.
413;do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original.
414;Denzel always gives a convincing performance along with the cast of stars in this project.
415;first of all, Meryl streep is fantastic.
416;And Denzel also does marvels with what he has to work with.
417;Laurence Harvey was more sympathetic.
418;The original film is a classic and for all those who have seen it this 2004 version provides minor twists and turns for all of the major characters and plot points.
419;You know what is going to happen, but not exactly, so that Jonathan Demme's film works pretty much equally well for those who have seen the original and those who have not.
420;national corporation, which actually makes the situation more realistic than the original (at least in terms of the villains).
421;By the time Marco finds something under the skin on his back, it seems there is something at work here that is more serious than depression or Gulf War syndrome.
422;Oh, you had better believe it.
423;Schreiber does a nice job as the man who is caught in between who he is, who he wants to be, and who he remembers he was once upon a time.
424;"Demme won the Oscar for directing ""Silence of the Lambs"" in 1991."
425;blooded instincts for political survival was incredible.
426;The scene where she's wearing purple sunglasses and swirls around lecturing the other Manchurian Global bigshots was breathtaking.
427;liev Schreiber who I recently enjoyed inThe Painted Veildoes an excellent job as Congressman Raymond Shaw.
428;As Shaw, he does a masterful job of playing the polished politician with perhaps too strong ties to his mother's apron strings.
429;that said, Denzel Washington turns in another blockbuster performance as Maj. Bennett Marco.
430;"Washington has two Oscars for ""Glory"" in 1989 and ""Training Day"" in 2001."
431;The levels he achieves .
432;result in a varied and excellent performance.
433;Demme particularly complimented Washington on the scene where Marco tells Shaw that there is a strong bond between the two of them.
434;"jon Voight who won his Best Actor Oscar for ""Coming Home"" in 1978 as a stressed out veteran does a good job here as Sen. Thomas Jordan who gets squeezed out of a vice presidential nomination."
435;Her demise is as strangely beautiful as it is violent.
436;demme keeps the pace moving, the intrigue breathtaking up to the final shots in the film.
437;This was a great picture whose performances make it worth viewing.
438;The Manchurian Candidate was the best movie ever I could not stop watching movie.
439;This movie was a great choice.
440;Definitely a great movie, The Manchurian Candidate, brings to the screen the story of a military officer and Persian Gulf veteran who realizes that he has been subjected to experiments against his will.
441;the film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.
442;needless to say, Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, Meryl Streep, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
443;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
444;Strongly recommended along with Courage Under Fire.
445;loved the camera angles, casting was flawless for this movie.
446;The plot kept you guessing and Meryl Streep of course is brilliant as the controlling obsessive mother.
447;And we crave something more than a science fiction story that tries hard to include elements of modern politics.
448;And there are references to recent incidents that seem right out of today's headlines as well as political speeches that can be attributed to a wide variety of real.
449;the actors all did a great job, especially Denzel Washington, cast as a former Gulf War officer who is trying to solve the mystery of his frequent nightmares and memories that don't seem to make sense.
450;The original Manchurian Candidate, starring Frank Sinatra, is an excellent thriller, one that had me scared for months.
451;stick with the original for a classic yet timely political conspiracy thriller.
452;i liked the plot, the new angle and the acting.
453;The original is a classic and this update is as good as if not better.
454;The villainess in this is every bit as good at the original.
455;A great updating of a great classic.
456;I found it to be very anti.
457;This time, Captain Bennett Marco is played by Denzel Washington.
458;She gets her way and we soon realize this is just the first step.
459;this film holds your attention as this political thrills to the amazing climax.
460;almost, but Raymond finally disappoints as the perfect son, the scheme set in motion during the Gulf War thwarted.
461;I was on the edge of my seat for the new one with Meryl S., Liev S. and Denzel Washington.
462;baked performance in this piece of road kill.
463;make I have ever seen.
464;the major theme of this fascinating story is power and control and how far some corrupted individuals will go to attain it.
465;Oscar nominations for Washington and Streep for sure.
466;the pace is intriqing and fast.
467;It is exciting even more so than the original.
468;a good movie if not better than the first one.
469;What actually does emerge is a pseudo.
470;This movie is scary by the way.
471;The Manchurian Candidate is a sleek, stylish thriller about power, politics and paranoia.
472;It is a remake of a truly classic 1962 thriller, which was directed by John Frankenheimer and starred Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, and Laurence Harvey.
473;While the new version is both scary and entertaining, the original is powerful enough to blow the viewer away.
474;national company to which she has sold her soul, she can achieve this.
475;the original triumphs because it is both a monument to great filmmaking and a product if its time.
476;the present movie is a techno.
477;On the other hand the movie is quite entertaining, even if it is a minor opus, enough to deserve being watched.
478;denzel Washington as Maj. Marco and Liev Schreiber as the Candidate give solid characterizations.
479;Nevertheless, in my opinion, is Meryl Streep as Sen. Eleanor Shaw, the candidate's powerful and ambitious mother, who gives the best performance of the film.
480;this movie is a good standard pastime.
481;I haven't seen the original, but by today's standards this whole sci.
482;The message is largely the same, but F.9/11 is authentic, clever, and entertaining.
483;And well, that's basically all there is to it.
484;Liev Schrieber and Meryl Streep both deliver solid performances.
485;"demme cleverly avoids trying to duplicate the amazing Garden Tea Party scene from the original and in many ways the braninwashing sequence in this new Candidate is weider
486;is Demme's new Candidate a classic in the tradition of the original?
487;That's right, folks, one of the greatest living actresses on the face of God's green earth comes on breathing fire and brimstone in a great scene in the beginning, pontificating and pointing that slender finger like a knife.
488;In 1962, the villains and instigators of a high.
489;demme is a talented director, though, and he does keep the early scenes of the film charged with a looming paranoid feel that did have me feeling the vibes of the original.
490;And homeboy can do a great close.
491;problem is: it's not deliriously engrossing, like the original made it.
492;Marco begins realizing he's right more and more, jumping through the loops of a prevalent conspiracy, and this just kind of goes on and on and on.
493;pilot, fading out scenes in a hastily edited fashion, permitting Washington to stammer and yammer like he's posessed by Woody Allen, and even alters the emotional pull of the movie.
494;In the (yes, I'm bringing it up again .
495;that happens when you remake a classic) original film, Frank Sinatra's Bennett Marco was a strong man who was deeply disturbed by a dream he knew was right.
496;And that, friends, is this .
497;The Manchurian Candidate, had it stayed closer to both the plot and the emotional resonance of its predecessor, could have been a gripping yarn that succeeded on technical, narrative, and character levels.
498;The movie has its moments (I sure liked seeing Bruno Ganz from Wings of Desire, but that's just me) since it's well.
499;photographed and occasionally suspenseful, but in the end I still can't see any point in its existence.
500;All this movie does is reminds you how much of a masterpiece the original was.
501;The story is great, and keeps you guessing the whole time.
502;A couple of scenes are particularly chilling, """"you'll se what I mean."""
503;Overall, an excellent film, with a great plot, and lots and lots of suspense.
504;The newest version of The Manchurian Candidate has an almost insurmountable chasm to overcome what with the superior reputation of the 1960's version of this story staring it in it's proverbial face.
505;Compare her Eleanor to Angela Lansbury's in the original: Lansbury is all motherly, Oedipal, crafty, intelligent, cunning, a real amoral snake willing to do anything to gain power.
506;updating the Richard Condon novel, director Demme and his writers have done an exceptional job of turning the red.
507;denzel Washington dominates this film in a performance that is the logical extension of his performance as the beat.
508;"In this film he has shaken off all remnants of his hero persona and dug as deep as he can go to his core: he's frightened, he's crazy and he's a man with a mission
509;This makes it worth owning.
510;While I personally doubted the movie within the span of the first thirty minutes, The Manchurian Candidate proved to be a very well done movie.
511;The intricacy of the story line is what made THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE such a well done movie.
512;As usual Oscar winners Washington and Streep do an excellent job and don't disappoint.
513;I won't summarize the plot line, but I will leave it as a surprise.
514;If you like movies with an intricate plot and with specific details, and you like Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, you will like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.
515;When Hollywood had a chance to talk about an important issue .
516;It was a good movie, better than the original one and glad to have gotten it to watch.
517;The original mixed a sence of paranoia with black humor very well.
518;and finally, Meryl Streep is a fine actress, but Angela Lansbury's performance in the original is legendary.
519;Lansbury is one of the greatest movie villains ever.
520;Her """"exit"""" from the film is one of the most powerful screen images ever."""
521;This film takes a couple of sittings to really understand the complexities of the story.
522;Denzel Washington gives a believable performance, contrary to what other reviewers have written.
523;Leiv Schreiber is also outstanding as the aspiring vice.

531;Three days later, they are found alive .
532;i have never seen the original, but this remake, from director Jonathan Demme, delivers a sufficient amount of mystery and intrigue to keep you on the edge of your seat almost until the credits roll.
533;"My only complaint is that they attempted to deliver a type of ""happy ending"" to the film."
534;Denzel Washington gives another excellent performance as the tormented Ben Marco.
535;This movie was definately better than I anticipated, and I would highly recommend it.
536;Schreiber is real good in this as well.

541;Very moving, very effective as 'Our Son' .
542;most chilling is the 'South African' rogue doctor somewhat physically a Hitler lookalike.
543;the acting is superb, the plot still fascinates and the dream/reality scenes are visually stunning.
544;go ahead, you are in for a treat.
545;The Manchurian Candidate takes inspiration from both Richard Condon's novel and its memorable 1962 film adaptation.
546;The Manchurian Candidate's themes are powerful and provocative, but the narrative is so far.
547;i have to compliment Meryl Streep's performance, though.
548;possession and sharp tongue make her charismatic nonetheless.
549;and easily the most interesting character in this film.
550;She's an ambitious ideologue who will stop at nothing to see that her country conforms to her vision.

556;a) denzel is an amazing actor, who again doesn't disappoint in this suspense filled movie.
557;But whether you want to compare the new version with the old or not, Manchurian Candidate 2004 is a pretty darned good, highly entertaining flick.
558;The direction by Jonathan Demme seemed to be very good and the actors playing the three main characters (Washington, Schreiber and Streep) acted their part to a tee.
559;all in all, I found The Manchurian Candidate suspenseful and enjoyable.
560;"However it might not be fair to compare the two even though they share the same title
561;Even so, the new version has good entertainment value and a great deal of suspense.
562;The acting performances are very good from the entire cast particularly Streep as the evil scheming biotch and the movie is also shot well.
563;The director does a good job in several scenes of zooming in on the actors' faces which really captures the state of the character or situation in a subtle way and adds to the feel of the movie.
564;Denzel Washington happens to be one of my favorite actors.
565;He shines again in this one, about an experiment by a Venture capital company into mind control techniques on gulf war veterans.
566;It was certainly entertaining and except for that black woman who acts as the FBI officer (Kimberly Elise I think) who in my opinion takes overacting to an extreme (check out the emotional scenes in John Q), the rest of the cast was great.
567;The acting was superb, the script was excellent (though it was based upon a movie based upon a book), and the directing was phenomenal.
568;Another point for which I liked it was the fact that the movie was constantly engaging.
569;I think that this film will indeed move out of the shadow of the original and become a classic itself.
570;I liked this movie a heck of a lot better than the original.
571;It is suspenseful and kind of creepy to think that our government could do such a thing (as you will find out once you watch the movie).
572;It kept my attention and I just wanted to know what would happen next.
573;This is an excellent movie.
574;Very much like the original but with differences that are done very well.
575;I highly recommend this movie.
576;Denzel always seems to deliver.
577;Denzel Washington is perfect in that role.
578;This one is updated to the story of prisoners captured during the Gulf War and a cover.
579;The actors, particularly Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, turn in excellent performances.
580;This was a good movie.
581;It kept my attention well, and I thought that Meryl Streep did an absolutely phenomenal job in her role.
582;This is a great remake of the 1962 original.
583;With a cast like this, you knew the movie was going to be good and Washington is really great.
584;Director Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs) shows that he can take a good multi genre plot and keep you on the edge of your seat.
585;He also does a nice job keeping you wondering if this is really happening or just in Washington's head.
586;I really liked the original and I thought this one is a good update to it.
587;I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good night of suspense.
588;this should have been a great movie.
589;The original was great and they had that example to follow.
590;The thrill and suspense are built into the script.
591;One of the producers/directors discusses how the blurred background behind the actors was to achieve a """"dream."""
592;"He was proud of that ""artistic license"" but projecting the point of the movie was less important."
593;one star for the actors.
594;Sometimes predictable, but often enough you are pulling for Washington, so the anticipation is higher.
595;Acting is very good (I still dislike all the roles Streep plays, including this one).
596;visitation of Frankenheimer's 1962 classic is quite good.
597;Demme continues to use his technique of having the actors speak directly into the camera.
598;This adds an eerie touch to the presentation, making the viewer feel as though he is part of the action.
599;as an owner of the Sinatra film, I found myself comparing and contrasting the two.
600;I think it is something people in general should watch and understand.
601;If you saw the original you will understand.
602;But Jonathan Demme's Manchurian Candidate is an effective thriller in its own right, heightened by brilliant performances.
603;It is wonderful to see this actress open herself up so wide and throw in every stylistic trick in her repertoire in her portrait of evil ambition and spooky mother love.
604;Liev Schrieber is perfect as her son.
605;This is a wonderfully paranoid thriller that can seem relevent, to either side, or mere escapist, and works on all of these levels.
606;taking on a remake of one of the finest films ever created takes stones.
607;It was, to say the least, an admirable idea, and had it worked, this new version of The Manchurian Candidate may well have stood with the original as a piece of American film history.
608;Thanks to Eleanor's machinations, Raymond snatches the vice.
609;time part of the screenplay works better than one would expect it to.
610;The new plot twists also work on a number of levels.
611;(Kudos to the screenwriters for keeping the title relevant while changing the setting, even if they did take something of an easy way out).
612;all that said, the usual suspects turn in some amazing performances.
613;Some time in this (or any) review of the film should be given to the performance of Liev Schreiber, who has quietly amassed a resume of excellent performances under the Hollywood radar, and blossoms here, albeit as a supporting actor.
614;(Washington's Marco has morphed into the film's main character, whereas Frank Sinatra played the supporting role to Laurence Harvey in the original, despite Sinatra and Harvey having roughly the same relative status in Hollywood in 1962 as Washington and Schreiber have today.)
615;If anything good comes from this film, it will hopefully be Schreiber seeing more lead roles.
616;an interesting flick, but one that pales in comparison to the original.
617;Washington does the best he can with what is, as presented, a muddled character.
618;He communicates intensity better than almost any other actor since Rod Steiger in his prime.
619;I loved watching the original for historical perspective (the scripting and wardrobe.
620;this screen play in this version was honed just right that I actually forgot it was a remake.
621;Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep lead a cast of highly talented actors.
622;Using the same phone # as in the original so they would have something in common with the good one.
623;"Jonathan Demme's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a superb and timely 21st Century remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 classic of Cold War terror and paranoia."
624;Both involve a group of soldiers who are brainwashed into believing that one of them, Sergeant Raymond Shaw, is a hero whose unquestioning bravery and quick thinking on the battlefield saved the lives of most of the men in that squadron.
625;In fact, upon his return, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor, a tribute he eventually parlays into a career as a United States congressman.
626;corporation (called Manchurian Global) that has positioned itself as the master puppeteer pulling the strings of government behind the scenes.
627;"And in its scathing vision of modern day politics, the film asks just how much of our freedom and civil liberties we are willing to sacrifice in exchange for ""security"" and ""safety."""
628;powerful senator and the ultimate Machiavellian matriarch, whose unrelenting and nefarious effort to get her craven, mediocre Congressman son elected Vice President, serves as the engine that pulls the story forward.
629;truths spinning around in his jumbled memory and mind, Eleanor works her way to the ultimate position of power.
630;a connection made even more frightening when the latter, working in a moral vacuum, is able to employ the latest in technological advancements to further its cause.
631;"although the surrealistic elements are probably less shocking today than they were in 1962, the film still does an amazing job replicating the dislocation and fragmentation of Marco's mind, establishing a beautiful balance between the world of ""real"" reality and the world of virtual reality, a concept that seems far less incredible in this day and age of ubiquitous computer technology."
632;Indeed, what this gripping tale of an attempted coup against the United States government manages to do is to remind us that, even in this age of international terrorism, the greatest threat to our unity as a nation and our safety as a people may actually come from within.
633;Arrived in a timely fashion.
634;Perfect condition and the movie itself was fantastic.
635;Denzel is great, liev is perfect and merrill is uber controlling.
636;Well casted and very well done.
637;I was very, very impressed with this re.
638;The movie had agreat feel, eerie, suspenseful, and intense but not too much ofany of these, and it flowed well, with many surprises yet alwaysunder control until the final scenes.
639;"what I have learned from these studies is that there are manyfactions behind the scenes, sometimes fighting each other, sometimesstrangely cooperating, yet the real ""enemy"" is the public, who arefed very well."
640;the performances were superb, except Ms. Streep's, and I say thatbecause even though she always delivers, what I saw in this moviewas her rejection of the devious, unscrupulous character sheplayed .
641;This film really made me wonder.
642;But it's important to let the film stand on its own merits, of which it has quite a few.
643;Even though the original came out WAY before my time, it's funny (in a scary way) how little things have changed.
644;Shaw is awarded the medal of honor for his deeds and the platoon returns home, save for two members who die in the battle.
645;Shaw has now become a surprise Vice Presidential candidate, mostly due to the drive of his hyper.
646;Marco believes he has uncovered a conspiracy involving their platoon and begins attempting to confront Shaw about it.
647;Soon both of them must face up to the truth of what really happened during that ambush.
648;demme has crafted a chilling and challenging look at our political society today.
649;He uses a lot of extreme close.
650;Washington delves into his character's ticks and trademarks, much the way Russell Crowe did with Nash in 'A Beautiful Mind'.
651;Streep does good work as usual as the mother you'd never want to have .
652;And her physical resemblence to Hilary Clinton is undeniable.
653;The actor who does the finest work though is definately Liev Schrieber.
654;I really hope this turn finally makes a star out of him.
655;He's been doing great work for years and this role is Oscar material.
656;the film itself is one of the better I've seen so far this year.
657;Though it unravels a little bit after the climax, for the most part it stays tightly constructed.
658;If you're at all interested, see it.
659;Even if you're a fan of the original, this one still has surprises in store.
660;Denzel and a outstanding cast were terrific!
661;The characters and plot were extremely well cast and I was intrigued from beginning to end.
662;Meryl Streep was awesome as always.
663;I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.
664;under all the political treachery lurks an enormous Corporation, Manchurian Global, contributing to both sides of the political dance but in fact backing a candidate they can completely control.
665;Running against her son's ticket to the white house is Senator Thomas Jordan (superbly played by Jon Voight), a man with enough power and experience in politics to thwart Ellie's plans for her son.
666;You really must see the film, because nothing is what it seems to be, and at the pace that both discoveries and sanity unravel, it is truly a nail.
667;"There is a very bizarre dream sequence, and a very disturbing ""incest is best"" scene between Ellie and her son Raymond."
668;far outshining any other aspects of this movie is the absolutely spectacular performance of Meryl Streep as Ellie Shaw.
669;I thought she had reached her pinnacle when she made me laugh so hard in `She Devil', stealing the show from every other actress in it, but I would resolutely state that this is her finest performance to date.
670;She comes across as hard yet feminine, determined and demented, powerful and righteous.
671;teamed up with such a successful actor as Denzel Washington, for me it was a no.
672;Liev Schreiber is fantastic in his portrayal of Raymond Shaw, reminiscent of a talented cross between Kevin Spacey and Kevin Pollak, very adept with facial expression and depicting emotion.
673;Jon Voight is phenomenal as Senator Thomas Jordan, and my hat is also off to character actors Miguel Ferrer and Bruno Ganz for their roles.
674;Manchurian Candidate: Sunspense, mystery, psychological thriller.
675;For those that love psychological thrillers, suspense, or sci fi.
676;It's natural to compare a remake with its original.
677;But I may be one of the few who like the pacing, the look and feel, and the general acting of this new one better.
678;Sure, the script could have packed more punch and pastiche (certainly our present world lends very well to notions of impeding danger, both on a national and corporate scale) but as it were, taken on its own merit, this is still a very taut thriller.
679;fetched at times, The Manchurian Candidate still delivers a 2+ hour, twist filled thriller.
680;regardless of the sensational conspiracy, the movie is quite entertaining.
681;Meryl Streep does a terrific Mommy Dearest.
682;Denzel Washington is, as always, on target.
683;Very twisted and strange plot, but great movie.
684;Definitly take the time to watch this one, it will be worth it in the end.
685;This is a movie that I would watch multiple times.
686;these elements were what riveted you to your seats in the original.
687;if you watch the special features,they inform you of some them in a way that doesn'tgive them the real impact that they had in the movie.
688;the actors in the original ( Frank Sinatra,Angela Lansbury,Lawrence Harvey ) along with the faithful to the novel script.
689;will keep you glued to your seats.You won't want to take a bathroom break.
690;With that in mind, this is a fairly decent thriller movie, that although slow paced, still manages to keep you interested for the duration.
691;Washington turns out a decent performance and Streep, whilst being a parody of the evil domineering mother, still manages to be fairly convincing.
692;Liev Shrieber is the last part of the acting puzzle who manages to lift this film from mediocrity to something half decent.
693;It has made me want to see the original to see if it as good (and as superior to this version) as I have heard.
694;A right wing view is supplanted in this way by a left wing view.
695;that is leftist Hollywood for you.
696;Their motto should be: will create sophist arguments for profit and the privilege of being a celebrity.
697;"Though it lacks the quiet dignity of the original, Jonathan Demme's talky update of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" manages to hit enough points to qualify as a watchable thriller."
698;As acclaimed an actress as she is, Streep's portrayal seems a burlesque of Angela Lansbury's stunning foray into villainy.
699;The original, an almost perfect film, remains the definitive version.
700;This made the experience much more dramatic and enjoyable, which is what you want a movie to do for you.
701;the cast is excellent and the film making is top notch.
702;It is visually and aurally appealing.
703;it's another winner for Denzel Washington .
704;he's become one of my favorite actors.
705;Makes a nice companion piece to Training Day.
706;i'm no film critic but wanted everyone to know this movie is timely, interesting, and very well done.
707;"Against the odds, the 2004 version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" succeeds, mainly because it doesn't just try to remake the 1962 original."
708;imagining as thoughtful one .
709;skillfully written, masterfully played, and wonderfully shot.
710;As you can always expect from Jonathan Demme, it's a beautifully crafted film.
711;While the plots are similar they're far from identical, and Demme unfolds his with perfect smart.
712;thriller timing and a contemporary narrative style, often deploying a highly economical use of images, voiceover and inter.
713;an excellent device for delivering maximum information in the shortest possible time.
714;There's also a lot to enjoy in the performances.
715;Denzel Washington manages to be simultaneously charismatic and pathetic, perfectly capturing the essence of the damaged solider.
716;Meryl Streep is destined for her fourteenth Oscar nomination, and possibly a win for Best Supporting Actress.
717;The Oedipal bath scene is particularly chilling.
718;Overall, this is a satisfying film: not only a respectful remake, but a solid thriller in its own right.
719;And it's worth noting also, in what is surely the most wonderful irony, that forty years after the original movie the Red Menace has been replaced by capitalism's darkest and equally dangerous breed .
720;industrial corporation, with designs on political power.
721;And after replacing Raymond Shaw by John Kerry i got really really scared.
722;Adding the absolute amazing performance by Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington, you have a absolute winner, and a guaranteed audience with fiend and foe.
723;I was very pleased with the acting, especially Streep's.
724;The original managed to both play on our fears of the insidious nature of the communist threat while deftly lampooning McCarthyism.
725;I feel that the modern version was a switch in it's political view, changing the enemy from the communists to the capitalists.
726;"I hoped modern effects and the like would have created something equally ""trippy"" for our time."
727;A good, enjoyable movie, possibly ruined by my pre.
728;with the storyline offering great possibilities for a great and very dark atmospheric film, Demme and the other contributors managed to make a boring saga that will have you reach for the fast.
729;The rest of the cast are simply putting in a good day's work, grab the check and go home.
730;Had the script been adequate the actors would've (perhaps) put in a better and more engaging performance.
731;I love movies with original plot Lines and this one is a home run.
732;Movie kept my interest from the beginning to the end.
733;Being a huge fan of the original film, I was immediately intrigued upon learning that there was going to be a remake .
734;In the original, you might have found suitable answers to some of these questions.
735;turning, and further gives you the impression that perhaps Raymond didn't despise his mother as much as he claimed to.
736;"Demme's version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is truly excellent indeed
737;Though some elements of the picture are purely science fiction (one would imagine), the terror behind them is real, as are the hallucinatory and dehumanizing effects of battle itself.
738;Washington is simply brilliant and remarkable heartfelt in his role (as always), but the real highlight here may indeed be Liev Schreiber, as the mystified puppet of his wily mother, played excellently by Meryl Streep.
739;Ultimately, I believe that this picture is Demme's second best, following, of course, """"Silence of the Lambs."""""""
740;"charlie""), his brilliance is revealed again here as it was in 1991 the aforementioned release."
741;As such, in giving us a generic corporate villain, the film has all the gravity of a James Bond adventure.
742;arguably, the actors in this remake are better than the actors in the original, or at least Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber give more nuanced and complex performances.
743;be candidate, but it was Harvey's unrelenting nastiness that made it so ironic in the original that he ultimately became both heroic and sympathetic.
744;"This film begs you to like Raymond Shaw
745;blooded ruthlessness and cheerfully vicious opportunism that made Lansbury's performance a classic.
746;Streep gives a fine performance"
747;Lansbury, on the other hand, was playing Lady Macbeth, a power behind the throne whose dominance was all the more frightening because it was unexpected, inexplicable, yet unquestioned.
748;"Frankenheimer's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is one
749;It tells us something about America, circa 1950.1965.
750;The Manchurian Candidate is an excellent remake of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, and Laurence Harvey.
751;I didn't think the original movie could be remade, but director Jonathan Demme has succeeded.
752;The basic storyline is the same as the 1962 classic with little twists and turns throughout, especially the ending, that keeps the viewer interested.
753;The 2004 version is an excellent movie that can stand on its own and is almost as good as the original.
754;denzel Washington is excellent, when isn't he?
755;Washington is very believable as a veteran struggling with post.
756;For an exciting, suspenseful thriller with an impressive cast and excellent story, check out The Manchurian Candidate!
757;Instead of cropping the wide screen original version to fit the TV screen, as it is usually done to wide screen movies, they just SQUEEZED the picture into a square format.
758;This is probably a good film.
759;the romantic interest has a more valid reason for involving herself with an obvious psychiatric case and there is one neat switch in the finale.
760;loathing in the original, Demme and Levine keep the two apart for most of the film, denying both of them the relationships with `normal' characters that highlighted their damaged psyches in the original.
761;Knocked unconscious, he still has a vivid memory of what happened.
762;The spectre of corporate greed is a credible replacement for a much diminished political ideology.
763;while likely not a blockbuster, this is an entertaining film nonetheless.
764;The results are often unnnerving, and almost successful in making us forget the plots and gimmicks that look no longer fresh and convincing as before.
765;Still, the film is worth your time.
766;the film is about Ben Marco (Denzel Washington good as always) who keeps on dreaming wierd dreams since he came back from the Gulf War.
767;hero, and with Shaw's fiercely power.
768;but because of curious things, like a 'tiny sliver chip' Ben Marco finds in a strangest place, Ben starts to suspect that there is something going on within himself, within America's political system, or within America itself.
769;And if so, how can Ben prove that when he knows his words would not be trusted anymore?The film's premises are no longer fresh and intriguing as used to be, and director Jonathan Demme knows that.
770;forward approach, Demme uses his unique camera works (like frequent close.
771;Instead, he walks on, right through the wall of the room, and quietly accepts the 'reality' of the next room.
772;not as great and unsettling as the original, 'The Manturian Candidate' is still a well.
773;made thriller with good acting and the dark and effective tone.
774;The film is interesting in the same way as the famous story about Coke and the subliminal message.
775;one of the few remakes that I feel really worked as was worth it.
776;Since I was not already familiar with the plot, this movie was very entertaining and kept my attention through the entire film.
777;My wife normally falls asleep when we watch movies late at night, but she actually watched the entire thing, so that should tell you something.
778;There are lots of twists and turns, and it has a sort of chilling, spooky feel to it because it seems like one of those stories that could possibly actually happen in real life.
779;When he sees that Raymond Shaw has been nominated for a Vice Presidential nomination, he sets out to meet with Shaw and discover the truth.
780;The original film has become a classic example of political intrigue.
781;notch with fine performances from all lead actors (Washington, Schreiber, and Meryl Streep as Eleanor Shaw give Oscar.
782;worth performances) and most of the supporting cast.
783;The film has a great plot, wonderful writing, and some very powerful artistic and directorial techniques that add to overall tone.
784;Jonathan Demme's remake of John Frankenheimer's classic political thriller still manages to retain the paranoia and suspense that made the original a masterpiece, only with a more disturbing and gut.
785;In this movie's case, that seat of power is the vice presidential role, while the brain.
786;washed puppet will gradually work up the last few steps to gain the role of president.
787;With technology rapidly advancing nowadays, this type of scenario is very quite possible.
788;Another man from his unit met Marco to discuss these dreams.
789;She pushes her son to run for that particular position by any means necessary.
790;Manipulative, persuasive, and perhaps scary.
791;Naturally, he still pulls off a great performance.
792;In this movie, he's more of a puppet.
793;also gone is the hypnotic triggering that involved the Queen of Diamonds for Shaw.
794;The dream sequences are also a bit, dare I say, better than how the original depicted the dreams.
795;This is just pure entertainment while the original prophecized the communists taking over America.
796;oh well, just watch the movie.
797;The story was good and the film had a good pace"
798;I think it is worth the cost.

800;Alexander Payne's 'Election' is prime satire.
801;Pick any of Hitchcock's films, and you have a great example of a thriller.
802;Stanly Kubrick gave us all one of the most popular horror flicks ever with 'The Shining.'
803;This offers an intriguing thriller full of conspiracy theories and brain.
804;throughout the film, you can tell that director Jonathan Demme and his cast and crew attempted to create a biting political satire.
805;She is the satire, she is the evil, she is the shock, she is a central disturbance, thus ruining the film's possibility of being entirely well.
806;"She encompasses everything the film lacks: for that, I'd give her an Oscar nomination
807;But overall, you knew she was having the time of her life.
808;Also notable is Liev Schreiber, whose mechanical persona works quite well for his character who is under so many forms of emotional and psychological control that a sense of drained mortality feels hauntingly realistic.
809;the character of Ben Marco is one with hundreds of layers.
810;There were even parts of the film in which Washington was inexplicably happy and, dare I say normal"
811;But I have seen Demme's masterpiece, 'The Silence of the Lambs,' and all I see isn't his return to fine cinema, but a regurgitation of thrill formulas and an unsuccessful ambition to create another disturbing work of genius.

818;It's like comfort food for the eyes.
819;"Meanwhile, those that DIDN""T see the original will wonder what all the fuss is about."
820;"Luckily, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" succeeds where that remake failed by touching on the themes of the original film, updating the story for a post.9/11 world and through careful casting."
821;Although it's flawed, it's still a powerful film that will leave an impression with audiences.
822;"That would be true of ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and also the remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" as well."
823;The former is a mind puzzle the latter is just designed to keep you glued to your seat.
824;The best featurette is the one on the cast of the film.
825;Both clearly enjoy each other's company and compliment each other very well covering material that the other hadn't thought about.
826;"an exceptionally good remake that updates this classic paranoid satire for contemporary audiences, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" brings Richard Condon's novel and John Frankenheimer's classic 1964 film to life with nice unique touches all its own."
827;The outstanding cast manages to make their characters uniquely their own.
828;The most poundingly suspenseful Political Thriller ever made.
829;"this movie claimed to be ""suspenseful""."
830;life politics for any of this to truly be interesting?Kind of surprising from a director like this who has created worthwhile endeavors on more than one occasion.
831;It has just enough differences to keep you interested, if you knew the original, while staying close to the original.
832;Liv Schreiber took Laurence Harvey's position as Raymond Shaw, and brought close resemblance to that role as well.
833;The whole nervous tone of the movie was another good match.
834;And of course, Denzel Washington worked well .
835;for once, a remake approaches the original movie.
836;Still, it's a good attempt and a good movie in itself.
837;What made it fun was the surprise ending that ended exactly the way you expected it to end.
838;That is always fun for me!
839;The joy of successfully figuring out what will happen and it does.
840;nice believable performances help make this a fun evening.
841;Angela Lansbury is delicious as the manipulative mother!Every single character in this re.
842;The first half of the movie is suspenseful and feels rather mysterious, especially for me who haven't seen the original.
843;Guided by assured direction, the first half of the movie generates an effective anticipating atmosphere that leads the audience into believing that something really exciting and dramatic is waiting to happen.
844;It offers such a strong sense of promising possibility that I was almost literally licking my lips eagerly looking out for the next twist and turn in the movie.
845;A bit more acute description of Raymond's inner struggles and psychological journey leading him to come to terms with his destiny would have undoubtedly given the movie more dimension and even more soul.
846;the acting is superb, though.
847;Danzel Washington is solid as usual.
848;overall, the movie offers a decent amount of thrill and emotion stimulation, though maybe not nearly enough to make one feel compelled to call it an excellent movie.
849;Denzel does a good job as the soldier whose memory of a certain event during the Gulf War haunts him in unforgettable dreams.
850;But if you've seen the original, you will appreciate this remake and you will appreciate casting Streep as the power starved Mother (although her scenes seem too short).
851;I think that this is Denzel's best move in a while.
852;"Yeah, okay, ""Man On Fire"" was good, and so was ""Out Of Time"", but this one, is the best of his recent films."
853;I give this movie a perfect five and if you could go higher, I would.
854;This is a must see movie.
855;It will have you glued to your seat.
856;"lovable and enjoyably cute Liev Shreiber, who plays ""Freddie,"" a man intent on rising through the Republican ranks of power to become the next vice president."
857;"The film also features fine performances from Obba Babatunda as ""Senator Wells,"" and the incomprable Simon McBurney as ""Atticus Noyle,"" who, along with the piercing Michael Pierce as ""Secret Service Agent #2,"" attempt to convince Freddie to build a podium for Freddie so that he may appear to be taller than he is in reality, thus impressing the Republican convention with his height and recent penile surgury."
858;all in all, it is a fine film and I am giving it my approval, if for no other reason than because it is a fine film, all in all.
859;"The performance of Teddy Dunn as ""The Mysterious Arabic Woman,"" is something to behold ."
860;I anxiously await good things coming out of this actor.
