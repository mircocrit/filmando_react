I:8380;1;Sandra Bullock is good as always.
I:8380;2;Wow I still need more words.
I:8380;3;Sandra bullock is hilarious in this movie!
I:8380;4;Just as most all her other movies, great performance, good co. stars and great movie.
I:8380;5;The writing is great .
I:8380;6;Sandra s funny and breathtaking all in one what cloths and make up can do is totally unbelievable, great movie.
I:8380;7;So many good actors in this movie which makes it complete.
I:8380;8;Movie has lots of fun in it.
I:8380;9;In my opinion, Sandra Bullock's main talents lay in her comic abilities.
I:8380;10;She can be more or less OK in more 'serious' movies, such as '28 Days', but she only truly shines in comedies.
I:8380;11;roaring good time especially if you like beauty pagents.
I:8380;12;Bullock and Michael Caine are great togther, he plays a pageant consulant.
I:8380;13;Just watch the original one, worth your time and money.
I:8380;14;Miss Congeniality is not Sandra Bullock's best film ( While You Were Sleeping remains my favorite), but it's a fun film to watch on a Friday night over a bowl of popcorn.
I:8380;15;Though utterly predictable, it has some very funny moments thanks most of all to Michael Caine, who is absolutely hilarious in his role as a gay pageant consultant ( Glide! )
I:8380;16;She is quite a gifted comic actress who really deserves much better than this middling script.
I:8380;17;Still, she makes the best of it, and it becomes enjoyable fare.
I:8380;18;Bullock is a comic genius.
I:8380;19;Michael Caine was wonderful as the groomer of the beauty queen.
I:8380;20;Sure, it didn't have great plot twist, but the movie is fun to watch.
I:8380;21;Sandra's is such a good comedian.
I:8380;22;it's even better than the movie.
I:8380;23;Sandra and Mark was so funny!
I:8380;24;You can tell they're great friends.
I:8380;25;Sandra makes fun of her butt,acting, and eyebrows.
I:8380;26;Michael Caine's role may be at the top of the list, but seeing William Shatner turn his character into a whimsical parody.
I:8380;27;sandra Bullock does what she does best: Plays a convincing role as a who.
I:8380;28;i. look FBI agent transformed into a beauty queen, with hilarious (and sometimes touching) moments when her real personality slips out.
I:8380;29;heather Burns' role was a little flat as well, but Burns brought a lot to it and made the character charming and believable, in a sweet, ditzy way.
I:8380;30;In this film, he's no Colin Firth, but that may have been a directorial choice so the focus stays on the thriller.
I:8380;31;eyed, determined force to be reckoned with.
I:8380;32;tuned within an inch of perfection.
I:8380;33;Once things shift into high gear, you'll have a good idea how it's going to end.
I:8380;34;They make me laugh, and I savor the nuances of seasoned actors like Caine and Shatner.
I:8380;35;the plot is also a gem for anyone studying story structure.
I:8380;36;the moment that's the first, big game changer in the plot .
I:8380;37;it's right there on the screen.
I:8380;38;Ditto most of the other key elements in hero's journey plotting and the structure Larry Brooks describes.
I:8380;39;for what this movie is, and how well it delivers, it's earned five stars from me.
I:8380;40;and a permanent spot in my viewing queue.
I:8380;41;After a 12 year hiatus from the movie I decided to watch it again.
I:8380;42;It is a very funny movie and I really enjoyed it.
I:8380;43;I'll probably watch it again in another 2 or 3 years from now.
I:8380;44;Always have enjoyed this movie!
I:8380;45;I've seen it since I was a kid and just saw it and I remember how good old comedies are!
I:8380;46;Miss Congeniality was a hilarious and often slapstick movie.
I:8380;47;a gorgeous woman who appeals to both men and women.
I:8380;48;She is transformed overnight into an unbelievable beauty .
I:8380;49;The places she tries to sneak out doughnuts are as amazing as the places she packs her firearms!
I:8380;50;My husband and I both enjoyed the movie immensely.
I:8380;51;Entertaining Sandra Bullock movie that keeps you laughing.
I:8380;52;Great for a girls night in but even guys would enjoy it!
I:8380;53;The plot is well timed.
I:8380;54;And this is one of my favourites!
I:8380;55;This is my kind of movie, funny, clean and action from start to finish.
I:8380;56;I love this movie, and it's nice that I can watch it whenever I want.
I:8380;57;It's funny but has a nice love story to it.
I:8380;58;I have seen this movie numerous times.
I:8380;59;to see Dirty Harriet transformed into a Beauty Queen in 2 days is absolutely hilarious and the characters played by Michael Caine,Candice Bergen,and William Shatner are simply perfect.
I:8380;60;I love this movie so much, after i bought it i watched it over and over!
I:8380;61;how they transform her from a clumsy sarcastic fbi agent to a perky contestent in the pagent is very funny!
I:8380;62;Sandra does her normal great job in this film.
I:8380;63;Actually, worth seeing twice to pick up on the little things you always miss first time around .
I:8380;64;the subtle and funny expressions or one.
I:8380;65;Oh, and world peace .
I:8380;66;I have seen this movie many times and each time it gets better and better.
I:8380;67;Get ready for a great movie and tons of laugher.
I:8380;68;Great cast ensemble to boot.
I:8380;69;I think Miss Congeniality is a light hearted entertaining movie.
I:8380;70;wracked with suspense or have my consciousness raised.
I:8380;71;I give it five stars.
I:8380;72;This is one of the drama movies that's my favorite.
I:8380;73;She is to enter the beauty pageant, which needs a beautiful, and clumsy kind of women, but guess what?
I:8380;74;I hope it is as good as the first one!
I:8380;75;Anything she does makes for a great movie.
I:8380;76;she is funny and she is beautiful.
I:8380;77;What a great combination delete backspace backspace
I:8380;78;Miss Congenieality is my favorite movie ever.
I:8380;79;I like because for once a girl is the hero.
I:8380;80;This film is action packed and I would really recomend it!
I:8380;81;Really fun and perfect for the whole family.
I:8380;82;They tend to be witty, lighthearted (with a few notable exceptions), rich in plot.
I:8380;83;Ms. Bullock herself is (and almost without exception plays) an intelligent, capable woman, and never more so than in this movie.
I:8380;84;She portrays a flawed character, but manages to make those flaws endearing.
I:8380;85;And she is very easy on the eyes.
I:8380;86;it's hard to review the plot in more detail without spoilers, but suffice it to say that I've watched this movie at least three or four times and still enjoy it.
I:8380;87;I also like Michael Caine, and he is brilliant in this movie.
I:8380;88;This is one of the best movies of all time.
I:8380;89;It had every thing humour charms and a wonderful cast.
I:8380;90;Sandra Bullock was excellent she made the movie seem more realistec she acted so well
I:8380;91;Its nice and good one and I really always trust Sandra Bullock movies.
I:8380;92;`Miss Congeniality' is just another film in the long line of films that help further impress my utter adoration for Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;93;In fact, she is probably my all time favorite comedic actress, and lord knows no one does a romantic comedy quite like Sandra.
I:8380;94;`Miss Congeniality' is less a romantic comedy and more, well, a comedy.
I:8380;95;Bullock owns this movie and it's thanks to her that the film is so enjoyable.
I:8380;96;She is beautified and entered into the contest with guarantied top ten placement.
I:8380;97;The heart of the film of course is about loving oneself and really learning to be the person you desire to be.
I:8380;98;In fact the pageant was the best thing that every happened to Gracie.
I:8380;99;the acting aside from Bullock is great.
I:8380;100;Together Bullock and Caine are dynamic.
I:8380;101;Candice Bergman is also great as the pageant spokeswoman who has outspoken distain for what Gracie's inclusion is doing to the pageant, and surprisingly William Shatner is perfectly cast.
I:8380;102;The pageant girls are also well cast, especially Heather Burns who plays Cheryl, the perky baton twirler from Rhode Island.
I:8380;103;in the end `Miss Congeniality' is a great time at the movies (or in the living room, whatever) and will surely be enjoyable for multiple viewings.
I:8380;104;Sure, it's far from realistic, and far from perfect, but Bullock is spot on and the rest of the cast make this a worthwhile endeavor.
I:8380;105;Now it was nice experience to see the film in English.
I:8380;106;Let's give Sandra Bullock credit where credit is due:.
I:8380;107;This is a smart actress who has leveraged her box office power.
I:8380;108;She's the finest physical comedienne working in film today.
I:8380;109;She knows what she's good at and works the formula.
I:8380;110;The movie resonated with audiences.
I:8380;111;Knowing a good thing when they saw it, they developed the equally funny 'Two Weeks Notice.'
I:8380;112;as far as the movie itself, I know from asking around that this is one of those films that was a real pleasant surprise.
I:8380;113;A lot of that can be attributed to Sandy Bullock's very high likability quotient.
I:8380;114;But Ben Bratt is very good here, too.
I:8380;115;And getting Michael Caine to appear is a real coup.
I:8380;116;In the transitional makeover scene, he steals the show with great lines like this one: Eyebrows: There should be two.
I:8380;117;This movie made me laugh.
I:8380;118;I absolutely loved this movie.
I:8380;119;Sound w a s even better.
I:8380;120;I loved being able to share the fun with my kids when we watched this movie again!
I:8380;121;Sandra Bullock is perfect in this witty and self depricating humor.
I:8380;122;So funny after all this time.
I:8380;123;Great physical comedy from some really talented people.
I:8380;124;"Love it, love to quote it
I:8380;125;Miss Congeniality is an amazing movie!
I:8380;126;It has the gorgeous Sandra Bullock and she does her job well.
I:8380;127;Sandra would probably be the last person on earth (in the movie) to enter a beauty contest, but she has to do it, because she gets word of a planned attack on the winner of this contest and is determined to find the crooks and hand them over to the cops.
I:8380;128;It is very well portrayed and all the actors do a good job.
I:8380;129;And the best part is: even kids can watch it!
I:8380;130;This movie illustrates why Bullock is such a likable and talented actress.
I:8380;131;It is funny, cute, and touching.
I:8380;132;has no love in her life.
I:8380;133;I also found it silly, that they started to make Agent Hart go on a diet.
I:8380;134;It's best not to ponder on illogical things.
I:8380;135;needless to say, she does end up saving the day, and gets transformed into this beautiful agent, and wins the Miss Congeniality title, given by her peers (not the agents, but the beauty queens).
I:8380;136;Sure, it's a popcorn movie that keeps you entertained.
I:8380;137;If anything, it's fun to see Bullock in a weird german.
I:8380;138;She probably can't do it in real life, but I still have always found it fascinating that it is possible to make music like that.
I:8380;139;i played along and then, it got serious w/actors, ambassadors, talks of passports, etc. the movie is hilarious.
I:8380;140;When I first saw it in the theaters, years ago, I actually liked it.
I:8380;141;It's the first movie I've ever seen with Sandra Bullock in it, and she's now one of my favorite actresses.
I:8380;142;hollywood has loved to use the indirect approach to selling singing and dancing.
I:8380;143;judy Garland musicals, giving rise to one of Hollywood's all.
I:8380;144;"And so we have ""Miss Congeniality,"" ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" and the most definitive one in the group ""Waiting for Guffman,"" as shows about shows that you wouldn't otherwise want to see at all!"
I:8380;145;Hollywood is now making fun about these shows that amateurs put on.
I:8380;146;"Miss Congeniality and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" are about small."
I:8380;147;If you've seen one of these movies and liked it, I am absolutely certain you'll like the other one.
I:8380;148;Miss Congeniality is much better plotted.
I:8380;149;it's mordant humor at its near.
I:8380;150;"But together with ""Guffman"" and ""Gorgeous,"" and some minor recent flicks about hair."
I:8380;151;One of a group of fine movies starring Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;152;she was great along with Michael Caine and Benjamin Bratt.
I:8380;153;If you like Sandra Bullock movies well I think you will defenetly like this one.
I:8380;154;Its funny exciting and keeps you on your toes almost till movie ends trying to find out who the bad guy really is.
I:8380;155;I like it not her best but surely a good movie fun to watch and I would say great for family since it is clean and funny.
I:8380;156;One of the best preformances of Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;157;I watched it over hundred times and enjoy it every time.
I:8380;158;The kids love it too.
I:8380;159;Love Sandra Bullock, she can play any role that is given to her.
I:8380;160;This is my all time favorite movie!
I:8380;161;Sandra Bullock is so great in this role.
I:8380;162;I loved this movie when I saw it as a teenager.
I:8380;163;I thought this movie was funny.
I:8380;164;Its a neat and fun movie, one of those which you can see with your eyes and mind closed, step out for a smoke, .
I:8380;165;Having said that, the actual acting is pretty neat.
I:8380;166;an Alpha male rather, who's only role is to portray the effect she has on men.
I:8380;167;Little is done with their relationship (or with Caine and Bullock either.
I:8380;168;"most of the interactions are lost in the comic nature of the scene)
I:8380;169;Sandra did a good job in this one.
I:8380;170;Loved the humor even with the suspense could look at this movie more than once
I:8380;171;If you are looking for a simple comedy, this is a definitely winner for you.
I:8380;172;While the storyline and plot needed a little more work to make a better overall movie, it was definitely enjoyable nonetheless.
I:8380;173;with two featurettes both interesting to watch once, after that one.
I:8380;174;Definitely good for a load of laughs.
I:8380;175;Loved it first, second, third time.
I:8380;176;Very funny with a great cast.
I:8380;177;Sandra Bullock was so good in this movie.
I:8380;178;but I enjoy this movie from time to time.
I:8380;179;I really loved this movie!
I:8380;180;william Shatner plays the Assistent Host of the pagent, providing comical relief throughout the film.
I:8380;181;This one is a hit.
I:8380;182;The film is incredibly predictable, but very fun.
I:8380;183;Sandra is at her most adorable in this movie.
I:8380;184;She has an incredible knack for this type of comedy.
I:8380;185;She is the master at this.
I:8380;186;The really best parts of this movie are Michael Caine and Candace Bergen.
I:8380;187;First of all, it's a real delight to see the former Murphy Brown on the big screen.
I:8380;188;This is by far Sir Michael's finest comedic performance.
I:8380;189;He is, and always will be, one of cinema's finest.
I:8380;190;prime actors to spout lines that can only be funny to those who somehow get off on seeing well known people on the big screen, regardless of lunacy of the dialogue.
I:8380;191;She shows her concern, not by going to the hospital to check on his condition, but by breaking things at home and pounding on a punching bag.
I:8380;192;Very seldom do I abandon a movie.
I:8380;193;I had not watched it for a few years but it was just as funny as I remember.
I:8380;194;Her character provides a undeniable proof that a silk purse can defintely be made from a sow's ear.
I:8380;195;Shatner is totally hilarious amid the chaos of the pageant's grand finale scenes, and Caine's rapier sharp sarcastic wit and humour is a welcome ingredient in the movie's recipe.
I:8380;196;However, the lovely, effervescent Sandra Bullock proves yet again to her fans that she is one of those rare actresses whose work can be enjoyed by a greater cross.
I:8380;197;both of us have loved Sandra since Speed , and this one had some good moments and lines, but not enough to save a lame plot.
I:8380;198;Sandra Bullock, Benjamin Bratt, Michael Caine and William Shatner do a fantastic job in this unique and original movie.
I:8380;199;Highly recommend this new classic.
I:8380;200;this is one that I have.
I:8380;201;bullock has a great comedic timing, making this a funny and entertaining movie that we've all enjoyed.
I:8380;202;If you're looking for a lift, this is a great one to watch.
I:8380;203;What you can not anticipate is the fun you have on the way.
I:8380;204;All the actors are well chosen for their parts.
I:8380;205;In fact it is best not to look at the actor list until they show up on the screen (It's a shocker.)
I:8380;206;There are bios on the actors.
I:8380;207;Most of all is a running commentary, which rivals the movie for top billing.
I:8380;208;Actually I thought Sandra was cute in her clumsy stage.
I:8380;209;There is a funny disquisition of using graphics to mask a certain object on Sandra.
I:8380;210;this may be one of Sandra's best.
I:8380;211;It is sure worth watching.
I:8380;212;even though you kinda know what gonna happen it's still enjoyable.
I:8380;213;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to see a fun comedy without the burden of profanity that is so popular in today's comedies.
I:8380;214;The movie is a fun.
I:8380;215;Caine is hilarious in his role as the effeminate coach and trades barbs with Bullock in their tug.
I:8380;216;This is your classic who.
I:8380;217;star movie a four in my opinion.
I:8380;218;Sandra Bullock was in top form and I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh.
I:8380;219;I forgot just how good this movie was.
I:8380;220;I am glad I bought it so I can watch it when ever I need a lift and a laugh.
I:8380;221;Sandra Bullock is hilarious in this film.
I:8380;222;She should stick to comedy.
I:8380;223;Very funny, cute, with lots of good one liners.
I:8380;224;Sandra Bullock is great in this film and is witty and great
I:8380;225;We watched and enjoyed this movie together.
I:8380;226;Sandra is a good actress and she can always make us laugh.
I:8380;227;She plays her part well.
I:8380;228;I found this to be an extremely entertaining, funny film.
I:8380;229;It has excellent dialogue and a very interesting story.
I:8380;230;Sandra Bullock (I must admit here that I think Sandra can do no wrong, though) and Michael Caine are perfect in this movie.
I:8380;231;Other noteworthy performances are turned in by Candice Bergen and Benjamin Bratt.
I:8380;232;This movie is pretty good.
I:8380;233;It's funny and shows that a clumsy and nerdy looking girl can transform overnight and really make a difference.
I:8380;234;Sandra Bullock has to be one of the most appealing actresses in Hollywood.
I:8380;235;Her screen chemistry is amazing, and she takes control of every scene she's in.
I:8380;236;most of the laughs come from the supporting cast of beauty queens, although Bullock has a line here and there that made me chuckle.
I:8380;237;bullock does a great job going from clunky to graceful, and Caine does a fine job as well.
I:8380;238;"I really enjoyed the film for what it was
I:8380;239;This is one of the perfect examples of good 90's movies.
I:8380;240;Love the entire cast and the story is fun.
I:8380;241;It's his job to get her ready, it's also his job to steal the film and hog all the best lines, which he does Brilliantly.
I:8380;242;ear smile for the Entire Running Time.
I:8380;243;Good enough to watch without feeling wasting time.
I:8380;244;Could you please help me?
I:8380;245;Because it's been almost a month and i'm yet to receive it.
I:8380;246;has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
I:8380;247;Sandra Bullock was made for this part (or perhaps the other way around) and it also has a fine supporting cast.
I:8380;248;It's packed with witty lines and hilarious scenes, a must see for anyone who likes to laugh.
I:8380;249;But a bikini wax and a whole makover.
I:8380;250;After awile she realizes that pagents are about making friends and helping each other.
I:8380;251;This is a great movie.
I:8380;252;This was a great movie to watch with my teen nephew and niece.
I:8380;253;We had a great movie night with lots of laughs.
I:8380;254;It is a bit corny and silly at times but sometimes you just want to watch something fun with a good ending.
I:8380;255;I love Sandra Bullock movies and this is a good one.
I:8380;256;It was certainly fun to see Sandra in this one.
I:8380;257;She falls in love with her Boss and shows the beauty girls what fun is!
I:8380;258;This is one of the best FEEL GOOD MOVIES of all time!
I:8380;259;You will enjoy it when you'll watch it, alone or with some friends!
I:8380;260;That Movie also contains a fanastic screenplay and a nice soundtrack as One In A Million by Bossom!
I:8380;261;I literally had to watch this movie twice ~~ because it's one of the few movies that I found delightful, charming and funny.
I:8380;262;A friend of mine recommended this movie to me because she knew that I was just a little depressed and this movie is the one to chase away the blues!!
I:8380;263;Sandra Bullock shows that a woman can be feminine and still be strong.
I:8380;264;if you're a girl and you have a night home alone to watch any movie you want ~~ I recommend this one.
I:8380;265;not a very good plot and not a great compliment to Sandra's talents, but she is so cute and makes the best of it.
I:8380;266;Sandra Bullock is a riot.
I:8380;267;Sandra B. is a perfect fit for the character she played.
I:8380;268;pleasant way to spend an evening.
I:8380;269;Any movie she is in turns out really good to watch.
I:8380;270;We enjoyed ourselves, had some good laughs but seeing it once was more than enough.
I:8380;271;It pokes gentle fun at beauty pageants in general and promotes a romance between star FBI agents Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt.
I:8380;272;There are some over the top performances by Candace Bergen, William Shatner and Michael Caine, all involved with the pageant from business stand points.
I:8380;273;There seems to a recent deluge of these beauty pageant movies.
I:8380;274;Beautiful with Minnie Driver is another and she portrays the self absorbed aspect of such a contestant pretty well.
I:8380;275;"My favorite beauty pageant movie is""Smile"" from the 1970s with Bruce Dern in the lead as a mover and shaker in the pageant world."
I:8380;276;Miss Congeniality probably is the best romance vehicle of all of them and if you are looking for a pleasant romantic comedy with an attractive leading man (Bratt), this will do nicely.
I:8380;277;I would love to see a first rate writer.
I:8380;278;"director, such as Oliver Stone, take on beauty pageants and show us the true underside of them as he did with football in ""Any Given Sunday."""
I:8380;279;world child beauty pageant murder, the Ramsey one.
I:8380;280;the writing of the sleuthing part could be written more intelligently or realistically but I enjoyed.
I:8380;281;Sandra Bullock is a great actress and enjoy many of the movies she is in.
I:8380;282;Sandra Bullock is fantastic as usual as is all of the cast.
I:8380;283;She is an amazing, strong woman and a wonderful actress.
I:8380;284;Very funny, family friendly movie.You have to see this film more then once because you will miss the one liners when you are laughing
I:8380;285;I liked this movie a lot.
I:8380;286;Bullock was a great comedian with both verbal and physical ways of being funny.
I:8380;287;Kudos to RI and NY as well.
I:8380;288;funny and good story line.
I:8380;289;i would watch this one again and again and still laugh
I:8380;290;Watched this with my daughters again, and they thought it was hysterical.
I:8380;291;A little dated, but still funny.
I:8380;292;Soon lots and lots of jokes and bit's are paraded around at the expense of the contestants, and along the way our heroine manages to fall in love, while learning that you can't judge a book by it's cover.
I:8380;293;this movie has two and half saving graces: 1.
I:8380;294;And Caine effortlessly steals nearly every scene in which he appears as the flamboyant pageant coach.
I:8380;295;On the downside Ben Bratt proves the theory that good hair and nice smile can only take you so far.
I:8380;296;I really liked him on Law Order, and maybe I shouldn't blame him for the awful material he was given to read.
I:8380;297;She's beautiful, funny and, heck, I just feel good when I watch her in movies.
I:8380;298;And she looks great in that bathing suit!
I:8380;299;This was the funniest movie I have seen for a long time.
I:8380;300;One of Sandra Bullock's earlier movies, she is doing what she does best.
I:8380;301;Definitely a feel good film
I:8380;302;A good story combining the suspense aspect with comedy.
I:8380;303;This movie is one of my favorites because it's funny and easy to enjoy.
I:8380;304;It's not the best acting from this cast but it's nice to see well known faces doing a less serious film.
I:8380;305;Sandra Bullock is a good actress.
I:8380;306;The movie was cute, funny and fun to watch.
I:8380;307;It is nice to smile a bit.
I:8380;308;Funny, Sandra Bullock is hot and she is great in this movie and the supporting cast is real good too.
I:8380;309;In her hands it becomes a very enjoyable, amusing and fun film where it could easily have been an unbearable mess.
I:8380;310;With the help of Micheal Caine, of all people, Gracie is transformed fit for the pageant.
I:8380;311;having said all that it is a very entertaining film.
I:8380;312;Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job, the suporting cast are solid and there is nothing that spoils enjoyment of this film.
I:8380;313;"My advice
I:8380;314;Funny, sexy, and completely delightful.
I:8380;315;She really makes me laugh.
I:8380;316;It is so funny and keeps you laughing the entire time.
I:8380;317;One of my favorite movies!
I:8380;318;I love Sandra Bullock so this was a good movie.
I:8380;319;A little slow in spots but very entertaining.
I:8380;320;I love Sandra Bullock, but this wasn't one of her best movies.
I:8380;321;Sandra Bullock is a great actress.
I:8380;322;This movie is a keeper to me because Ms. Bullock was very good in her part of this movie.
I:8380;323;When TV has nothing to offer, this movie is entertaining and cute.
I:8380;324;Sandra Bullock is great and is so funny!
I:8380;325;This is one of my favorites and I still watch this movie to this day.
I:8380;326;She really did a great acting and producing job in this movie.
I:8380;327;Then I bought it to add to my collection and loved it!
I:8380;328;This is definitely one of those classic fish out of water movies.
I:8380;329;Bullock, who stars as an FBI agent, works on a case involving a beauty pageant in which she, the ultimate tomboy, is forced to dress up like a beauty queen.
I:8380;330;Throughout the movie, she transforms from a Butch.
I:8380;331;like figure to a gorgeous young woman with a classically male attitude.
I:8380;332;Lots of laughs, lots of unexpected turns.
I:8380;333;i'd recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor, especially t. shirt.
I:8380;334;I would love to meet the cast and give them a high five.
I:8380;335;Sandra is my favorite actress
I:8380;336;I love this movie and was grateful that it was part of the Prime Instant Video program.
I:8380;337;Sandra Bullock is amazing and I think this movie proves it.
I:8380;338;great movie considered a classic and one of my favorites, I will never grow tired of watching Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;339;My daughter Loved this movie!
I:8380;340;She and my wife watched it while her boyfriend was away out of state and she was missing him.
I:8380;341;It just makes me laugh, period.
I:8380;342;SB can play a klutz very well, and I always love Michael Cane.
I:8380;343;This movie is always a good and fun choice to watch.
I:8380;344;:) A light hearted and feel good film that I recommend.
I:8380;345;If you are a girl who has never seen this then I'm shocked!
I:8380;346;flick, part action and part comedy, this is the best movie since Charlie's Angels (or did that come out after this movie?)
I:8380;347;Sandra, along with a great supporting cast, manage to poke fun at everything, including themselves.
I:8380;348;Sandra's comedic ability is remarkable.
I:8380;349;Even more remarkable is the ability to be both funny and sexy at the same time.
I:8380;350;To all involved: well done!
I:8380;351;This leads to some incredibly hilarious and original scenes that showcase her awkwardness.
I:8380;352;This is a movie you can watch over and over again, all the while still laughing at the brilliant jokes and plot.
I:8380;353;All the supporting acting is great, especially several Miss America women with varying personalities.
I:8380;354;it's very rare that a perfect comedy comes along!
I:8380;355;What makes it perfect is that it empowers women without demonizing those who are beautiful or princesses.
I:8380;356;She snorts and laughs as she's transformed into a beauty queen and makes the girlfriends she needed.
I:8380;357;And love the use of donuts.
I:8380;358;Sandra Bullock ability to transform from one of Hollywood's most beautiful woman into an attractive tom boy is amazing.
I:8380;359;Combined her looks with her comedic ability and acting and almost all of her movies are fun to watch.
I:8380;360;This gal could do a movie standing on her head and I'd love it.
I:8380;361;She is one of my favorites.
I:8380;362;She is a gifted actor.
I:8380;363;She is funny and plays the comedian and yet can take being humiliated like water off a duck!
I:8380;364;She can be serious and tug at your heart.
I:8380;365;She is talented enough to meet it all.
I:8380;366;This movie is funny, has drama, and has action, and a little romance.
I:8380;367;It pretty much has everything to make it a hit!
I:8380;368;I like this one much better than the second one.
I:8380;369;I loved her personality in this one.
I:8380;370;A big thanks to Amazon Prime!
I:8380;371;Sandra Bullock delivers another superb performance in this one.
I:8380;372;I loved the music to, I'd never heard of Boson before until I researched the music, and now I'm a fan!
I:8380;373;This is a good movie, and it will appeal to teenage males just as much as anyone else.
I:8380;374;The plot is very strong as well.
I:8380;375;Sandra Bullock is perfect for this story.
I:8380;376;Funny yet sends a good message.
I:8380;377;Both are a Must See!
I:8380;378;It's well written script, produced and great actors.
I:8380;379;All ages will enjoy this movie!
I:8380;380;This movie was so funny, Sandra Bullock played a wonderful part.
I:8380;381;WOW I love this movie!!!!!
I:8380;382;Yes, it's a tiny bit left.
I:8380;383;headed, and men as the centres of the universe are notably absent.
I:8380;384;average in a swimsuit actually wins the damn thing it always will be.
I:8380;385;(See, the main dramatic supporting roles are male.
I:8380;386;Sandra Bullock would be watchable reading the phone book, and sure enough she's watchable here.
I:8380;387;And she gets almost all the best lines, but as she appears to have the best delivery of anyone in the cast, this does not seem inappropriate.
I:8380;388;high concepts that the trailer explains.
I:8380;389;so, if you like Sandra Bullock then watch this gentle comedy with medium hopes and you'll be happy.
I:8380;390;A great movie with underlying tones.
I:8380;391;Sandra Bullock is great in this movie.
I:8380;392;now comes the irony and humor.
I:8380;393;The FBI has a good lead that there will be an attack at the upcoming Miss America contest and guess what Gracie is all they have.
I:8380;394;Sandra Bullock is a real treasure.
I:8380;395;Prime is a wonderful value.
I:8380;396;Wonderful acting, good clean comedy.
I:8380;397;The movie makes fun of the beauty pageant scene without being crass or rude.
I:8380;398;Sandra Bullock is beautiful, funny, and just awesome.
I:8380;399;The rest of this all star bunch keep it rolling.
I:8380;400;I was in the mood for an entertaining film that didn't take a lot of thought and this fit the bill.
I:8380;401;candace Bergen is well cast as a former pageant winner who is now the director of it.
I:8380;402;She is sweet and proper on the outside but, has a dark and calculating underside.
I:8380;403;This movie, despite its predictability, is genuinely entertaining.
I:8380;404;"Perhaps, I will ultimately see ""Miss Congeiality 2"" and give my opinion in a later review."
I:8380;405;Sandra Bullock is hilarious in this movie.
I:8380;406;acts, but she's so cool about it that you don't mind.
I:8380;407;Candice Bergen is lovely as the villianess, and Michael Cain provides a master's touch appropriately.
I:8380;408;It's no wonder that Sandra Bullock has gone on to be one of the best actresses of our generation.
I:8380;409;Her life and enthusiasm in this sometimes.
I:8380;410;I love this movie!Why?Because, for one, Sandra Bullock is absolutely great in this funny movie about a cop (FBI Agent, whatever) who joins a beauty pagent 'Scholarship Fund' to go undercover and find the an infamous killer.
I:8380;411;sandra and Michael Collin's screen relationship is completely charming, their scenes becomming the main reason to watch this movie.
I:8380;412;They have a great chemistry, as do Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt, whom the movies love story centers around.
I:8380;413;i love this movie because it focuses on what great movies are about.
I:8380;414;Being fun and all around entertaining.
I:8380;415;Candice makes a great foil as does Michael Caine.
I:8380;416;The middle stretches a bit but the first half is wonderful.
I:8380;417;I love this movie .
I:8380;418;Sandra Bullock is always so good.
I:8380;419;It's very funny and I never get tired watching it.
I:8380;420;Great comedy and fun 2 follow.
I:8380;421;Sandra Bullock is outstanding and so is the directing.
I:8380;422;Recommend for all ages to see
I:8380;423;It succeeds admirably with its goal.
I:8380;424;Miss Congeniality is funny and well.
I:8380;425;Michael Caine is hilarious as the man in charge of making her over in two days, and Benjamin Bratt is convincingly clueless and charming as her friend and sudden supervisor.
I:8380;426;Candice Bergen and William Shatner, as the pageant's directors, are brilliant casting choices.
I:8380;427;while Sandra Bullock goes overboard at times making her character uncouth and uncoordinated, she completely carries this movie with her on.
I:8380;428;Her makeover is convincing because Bullock never allows us to forget what lies underneath the sheen.
I:8380;429;but in just that brief time, we see Gracie Hart grow as a person, gaining a few grateful friends along the way.
I:8380;430;viewers are in for a light and lively good time when watching this modern Cinderella story, and they'll find themselves cheering for the underdog, and for World Peace.
I:8380;431;Sandra Bullock is hilarious in this movie.
I:8380;432;It is just fun from one end to the other.
I:8380;433;Watching Ms. Bullock go from tomboy to beauty queen was a hoot (especially when she was with Michael Caine).
I:8380;434;If you want to see a movie that is entertaining (not mind.
I:8380;435;Great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;436;Comedy and suspense in one.
I:8380;437;A great movie to relax and unwind at the end of a hard day.
I:8380;438;"Because I can usually predict what will happen next in most comedy's this film
I:8380;439;candice Bergen and William Shatner manage the pageant and hire Michael Caine to transform Bullock.
I:8380;440;so goes the frumpy, tomboyish agent into a gorgeous model.
I:8380;441;For her part, Bullock received a Golden Globe nomination for best actress.
I:8380;442;bullock is simply hilarious in this unpredictable movie .
I:8380;443;Sandra Bullock plays a great part.
I:8380;444;It's a fun movie to watch again.
I:8380;445;Sandra is Sandra (a good thing, here), but Michael Caine makes it all work.
I:8380;446;And William Shatner was perfect as the washed.
I:8380;447;This is one of those movies I can watch at any time and have it play in the background if I'm busy doing something else.
I:8380;448;This is a movie that you have to keep seeing over time!
I:8380;449;It's funny and refreshing, it never gets old!
I:8380;450;Bullock's fun and comedic timing is infectious .
I:8380;451;There lies the romance with Benjamin Bratt, her partner .
I:8380;452;and her friendship with the contestants, as well as a bucketload of fun and laughter with her antics.
I:8380;453;drenched movies and the energy brimming in her actually made her, fortunately, refreshing and hilarious.
I:8380;454;hearted entertainment at its best with an ensemble of seasoned supporting casts and fluffy romance.
I:8380;455;Sandra Bullock has never looked this good .
I:8380;456;deep pleasure if you want to steer clear of heavy movies.
I:8380;457;Have watched this movie several times and will probably watch it again.
I:8380;458;Funny, funny movie that can be shared with the family (tweens and up due to bar scene).
I:8380;459;Sandra Bullock did an awesome job.
I:8380;460;It has become one of my favorite movies.
I:8380;461;I look forward to watching sequel.
I:8380;462;One of those movies you can watch over and over again.
I:8380;463;Nice contrast of some drama with lighthearted acting by bullock and Caine, who is a very gifted actor,.
I:8380;464;It offers up comedy while giving an inside view to a rougher side of Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;465;This is a great Movie for anyone to watch it is so funny Sandra Bullock was wonderful and very funny.
I:8380;466;Sandra Bullock struts, sparkles, and stumbles her way through this comedy spoof about beauty pageants and the FBI.
I:8380;467;Michael Caine is perfectly cast as the makeover wizard with the ability to transform anyone into a dazzling beauty contestant complete with the right answers for those crown.
I:8380;468;William Shatner and Candace Bergen are crisp, perky and flamboyant.
I:8380;469;If you liked Dirty Rotten Scoundrels , you will enjoy this comedy.
I:8380;470;you will miss something delightfully funny and entertaining.
I:8380;471;For genuinely amusing and incisive look at beauty pageant industry, check out Michael Ritchie's 1975 film: Smile.
I:8380;472;One of those movies I watch over and over when I need a laugh.
I:8380;473;Sandra Bullock is very funny and sweet.
I:8380;474;Great to watch while doing your chores.
I:8380;475;I would recommend it to the public.
I:8380;476;"It creaks in every joint, the plot line was old when Bronco Billy rode a coyote, or whatever they rode back then, and none of the characters had sufficient substance to develop from
I:8380;477;Light fun, but, fun nevertheless.
I:8380;478;When transformed she does look very good.
I:8380;479;There are a few laughs, a few titters.
I:8380;480;As I said, when you want a break from the heavy stuff, have had sufficient doses of suspense, reality, and marital entanglements, this is a good alka seltzer for your upset stomach.
I:8380;481;This is a funny, wonderful Pretty Woman/My Fair Lady story.
I:8380;482;The twist here is that our heroine, Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock), is a smart, tough F. b. i. agent who does NOT want to be transformed.
I:8380;483;Michael Caine is brilliantly funny as her makeover guru.
I:8380;484;She resists most of the way through the pageant.
I:8380;485;masticating tomboy geek into a believable beauty pageant contestant.
I:8380;486;The interplay between Bullock and Caine is what makes the movie worth watching.
I:8380;487;this is a wonderful movie because Hart doesn't give up her soul or her values in her transformation from duckling to swan.
I:8380;488;(Her talent performance in the pageant shows you this in very clear terms.)
I:8380;489;All that happens to her is she becomes more comfortable with her feminine side and she learns to appreciate other smart, ambitious women who are also beautiful and know how to take advantage of that fact.
I:8380;490;It is well worth repeat viewing.
I:8380;491;But Sandra Bullock was great, as usual.
I:8380;492;A well acted modern version of the My Fair Lady plot.
I:8380;493;Sandra Bullock does a nice job.
I:8380;494;And William Shatner is the perfect MC.
I:8380;495;Beauty pageants are such an easy target.
I:8380;496;Smile with Bruce Dern and Little Miss Sunshine are also great comedies that use the pageant theme as comic fodder.
I:8380;497;Any movie with her would be a sure entertaining and worth my time and money.
I:8380;498;The most I can say for this movie was that it was an entertaining movie, not great but entertaining.
I:8380;499;CAVEAT: My daughter loves this movie and has probably watched it over 100 times.
I:8380;500;basic plot: A beauty contest has been threatened and the FBI plants a female agent inside the contest.
I:8380;501;I found it nearly amusing the first time around.
I:8380;502;three major themes emerge in the movie: 1) self.
I:8380;503;If you want a good thriller that will keep you sitting on the edge of your chair, look elsewhere.
I:8380;504;the second theme gives the movie a beautiful haze of irony.
I:8380;505;In this flick, we see this in sharp relief to Sandra Bullock's kick.
I:8380;506;In the end, her nonconformity saves the day.
I:8380;507;I want her to have the courage to think for and be herself.
I:8380;508;which brings us to the final theme.
I:8380;509;Bullock's character is the most transformed during this story.
I:8380;510;What a great gender message!
I:8380;511;The acting isn't bad, and I love the themes, boosting it to three stars, which is really more than it deserves as entertainment.
I:8380;512;Because it is awesome and it is one of my favorite movies of all time!
I:8380;513;Love Sandra Bullock and should have a million stars!
I:8380;514;I just love this movie!!!!
I:8380;515;Great actress and very funny!!!!
I:8380;516;Wish you guys have part 2 on here!!!!
I:8380;517;I love Sandra Bullock and seeing her in this role was hilarious.
I:8380;518;Not the best storyline but definitely worth watching.
I:8380;519;She is wonderful and exists in a plane far and above the rest of the movie.
I:8380;520;See it for an outstanding comic performance by Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;521;She was warm, funny, witty and real.
I:8380;522;She truly is a star.
I:8380;523;This movie was hilarious and poked fun out of every situation!
I:8380;524;This movie is good for the old and young and is defintely worth your money!
I:8380;525;I absolutely loved this movie!
I:8380;526;This is one of my favorite Sandra Bullock movies!
I:8380;527;She had me laughing from beginning to end.
I:8380;528;This is definitely worth seeing if you are a Sandra Bullock fan or want to see a hilarious movie that will keep you laughing till it is over!
I:8380;529;Miss Congeniality takes the idea and runs with it.
I:8380;530;Sandra Bullock is at her best in this movie, providing the anti.
I:8380;531;Her acting makes her character seem really genuine, flaws and all.
I:8380;532;The rest of the cast provides great support, from Michael Caine to William Shatner as pageant officials.
I:8380;533;Overall, this is a classic comedy that will probably last a long time.
I:8380;534;Interesting if implausible script, with several strong performances.
I:8380;535;this movie made so much sense and had an unpredictable side to it.
I:8380;536;her talent at the talent part of the pagent is hilarious!
I:8380;537;This movie has soooo many funny parts.
I:8380;538;it was by far the best movie i've ever seen everyone in the theaters was in hysterics!
I:8380;539;Turned out to be something totally unexpected.
I:8380;540;Could be a modern day fairy tale with a strong heroine.
I:8380;541;Love Sandra Bullock and this is her at one of her best!
I:8380;542;Funny for the whole family!!!
I:8380;543;I watched this movie because it was free, but I ended up really liking it.
I:8380;544;Sandra Bullock was great as a tomboy out of her element.
I:8380;545;I have both movies Miss Congeniality and they are funny comedys.
I:8380;546;I love Sandra Bullock as an actress.
I:8380;547;i have other movies she has done and they are also great.
I:8380;548;Sandra Bullock at her comedic best with a host of supporting roles that makes this romp through the Miss America(?)
I:8380;549;as always, Caine plays the character flawlessly and, in addition, also happens to be gay adding a flamboyance to the role.
I:8380;550;sandra is thrust into the role to thwart an assassination of pageant winner.
I:8380;551;Even though most would like Sandra to win, she can't and somehow finds the killer, delivers some punch with Caine, makes her boss (Bratt) get the hots for her, and ends up being just one of the girls.
I:8380;552;the film is a delicious take.
I:8380;553;28 days was funny in parts but Miss Congeniality was funny from beginning to end.
I:8380;554;This is a really cute movie, as most of Bullock's comedies are.
I:8380;555;For some fun, just sit back and enjoy.
I:8380;556;Miss Congeniality is by far the biggest production and the best of the lot.
I:8380;557;the story is funny and Bullock shows her range, proving to be an excellent comedian in addition to her proven talents as a dramatic actor.
I:8380;558;eyed admitting what a great experience it was.
I:8380;559;There is plenty of silly slapstick humor.
I:8380;560;Bullock does her runway thing with aplomb, and her tongue firmly in cheek.
I:8380;561;Michael Caine is wonderfully droll as the beauty consultant who is given the impossible task of turning the ugly duckling into a swan.
I:8380;562;"In one of her early films in 1991 (""Love Potion Number 9""), she plays a geek who discovers a love potion and turns into a knockout."
I:8380;563;That film was an early indication of her comedic talents, but she eschewed zany comedy for dramatic and romantic roles for many years after that.
I:8380;564;It is good to see her return to it.
I:8380;565;this is a very light and entertaining film that is easy to watch and easy to forget.
I:8380;566;At over $100 million gross it had plenty of mass appeal.
I:8380;567;The comedy is silly but fun, and Candice Bergen, Michael Caine and William Shatner provide some terrific moments in supporting roles.
I:8380;568;It is a good, solid comedy.
I:8380;569;It's the kind of movie you can just enjoy without thinking about it.
I:8380;570;Sandra Bullock is wonderful, as always.
I:8380;571;No surprises here, but an enjoyable watch.
I:8380;572;As much as I enjoyed it, the thought of watching the sequel was too much.
I:8380;573;Its a funny movie with a little bit of action and romance.
I:8380;574;I will recommend it if you are looking for something fun to watch.
I:8380;575;Sandra Bullock is always delightful.
I:8380;576;We loved her and the movie.
I:8380;577;Miss Congeniality is a very entertaining movie about an FBI agent who goes undercover to protect the most beautiful women in the world, at the Miss America Pagent.
I:8380;578;The story follows this woman, who is less than elegant, and watch her transform into this beautiful woman.
I:8380;579;I wont give away the whole story because its a very funny and entertaining movie, both Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt shine in this one.
I:8380;580;Its a must have if you enjoy non stop laughter and entertainment, this is your movie.
I:8380;581;mouthed FBI agent in a beauty pageant.
I:8380;582;She teams well with Michael Caine as a pushy pageant consultant.
I:8380;583;I really enjoy her dry humour.
I:8380;584;It relaxes me, big time and besides she is very pretty.
I:8380;585;If you're a Sanda Bullock fan you'll like it.
I:8380;586;Love This movie : ) Sandra is absolutely amazing and so much fun in this movie.
I:8380;587;I recommend Miss Congeniality anytime you want to feel like a strong, sexy, and greatly silly woman.
I:8380;588;It makes me want to beat up a punching bag, while wearing a push up bra, and makeup.
I:8380;589;The relationship between Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt is not believable, the acting is fair at best.
I:8380;590;up diva, other than that this movie is a bust.
I:8380;591;Sandra did a great job.
I:8380;592;My nieces and her friends love this flick.
I:8380;593;A great date movie and pretty funny.
I:8380;594;I watched it years ago and stumbled across it again.
I:8380;595;MISS CONGENIALITY, in my opinion, is the most hilarious and glamorous Sandra Bullock movie I've seen.
I:8380;596;boyfriend, and he laughed at it A LOT.
I:8380;597;Even though I didn't laugh that much, I still enjoyed it as much as he did.
I:8380;598;To all you Sandra Bullock fans who have not seen MISS CONGENIALITY, I HIGHLY recommend it!
I:8380;599;You're in for a good time and a LOT of laughs, so, go out to the theater and see it today.
I:8380;600;It's fun for everyone to watch.
I:8380;601;I watch this movie about once a year and always love it.
I:8380;602;As is the supporting cast.
I:8380;603;Sandra Bullock showed that she can be humble, change her opinion and also make fun of herself.
I:8380;604;I'd recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8380;605;The second Miss Congeniality was kind of ridiculous, but the original one was hilarious.
I:8380;606;Sandra Bullock is spectacular (as always)
I:8380;607;If i have a bad day i watch this movie and it makes me laugh every time.
I:8380;608;Miss Congeniality is a very funny movie.
I:8380;609;Maybe it's a little predictable, but it is full of heart and humor and fantastic acting.
I:8380;610;grace Hart (the incredible Sandra Bullock), an FBI agent who goofs up a little too often, goes undercover at the Miss United States pageant on Operation Thong.
I:8380;611;great supporting characters include Candice Bergen as Kathy Morningside, the uptight pageant director, and William Shatner, in a hilarious send.
I:8380;612;It's fun listening to Sandy and Marc, because they're good friends, and there was a lot of ad.
I:8380;613;And when you watch the movie you'll see why that's funny.
I:8380;614;Stan needed to be larger than life to fill Bert Parks' shoes and Bill Shatner was wonderful.
I:8380;615;"He totally embraced the roll, and, as life imitates art, he has just been set to host the real USA pageant this year."""
I:8380;616;"They are really the unsung heroes of the movie business."""
I:8380;617;The Pageant (10 minutes) This is a continuation of extra #3, and also fun.
I:8380;618;"Caine says, ""My wife is a beauty queen, she came third in Miss World."
I:8380;619;This is a great little 19.
I:8380;620;William Shatner gives you the multiple choice questions.
I:8380;621;At the end, he tells you how likely you are to win a beauty pageant.
I:8380;622;There is humor in the choices given you and even more humor at the end, when Shatner gives you your reading based on your answers.
I:8380;623;I was very surprised and pleased with Sandra Bullock's hilarious performance.
I:8380;624;miss Congeniality is a lighthearted and fast.
I:8380;625;paced comedy with a lot of funny lines and some schtick, and good performances by all the main characters.
I:8380;626;Great to see Michael Caine, Candace Bergen, William Shatner in fine form!
I:8380;627;The comedy is light, the acting job is well done but we never saw Sandra in a such role before.
I:8380;628;But still she proved to be a great actress not to look sexy!The main weak point is the overall plot.
I:8380;629;Oh yes you enjoy few laughs but one thing for sure, this movie is not for keep.
I:8380;630;I would love to have a job like Sandra Bullock's character does in Miss Congeniality , an exciting, and uncommon one.
I:8380;631;I think it is very cool that she saves the pageant and gets a real life.
I:8380;632;I would recommend this to anyone who would be able to relate, or enjoys Sandra Bullock movies.
I:8380;633;fun to watch every time I've seen it.
I:8380;634;It funny and well made.
I:8380;635;What a fun movie and Michael Caine is great in his part.
I:8380;636;Sandra is a beauty with great physical comedy too.
I:8380;637;Sandra is just fun to watch.
I:8380;638;The only reason this film even got two stars from me is that I love Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;639;Everybody in the film is watchable and even likable.
I:8380;640;The scoring was brilliant, and Caine and Bergen brilliantly and quite beautifully managed NOT to steal the show.
I:8380;641;Sandra Bullock is always funny and she doesn't disappoint in this movie.
I:8380;642;She is laugh out loud funny as an undercover federal agent in the Miss USA pageant.
I:8380;643;My kids loved it, Sandra Bullock is a great comedienne.
I:8380;644;The supporting cast also great.
I:8380;645;My sisters and I love this movie!
I:8380;646;It's cute and charming and still manages to get laughs out of us every time!
I:8380;647;My daughter and her friends enjoyed watching this for the umteentime.
I:8380;648;I hadn't seen this movie in several years and I found it to be just as funny this time around.
I:8380;649;Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actors and her performance certainly made this movie.
I:8380;650;At times it moved a slow but over all did enjoy it.
I:8380;651;The director acts as if he is an incredible coordinator, making things happen silmultaneously in two places at once for the final scene.
I:8380;652;"My favorite comedy of all time is the original ""That Darn Cat""."
I:8380;653;Always has been, always will be.
I:8380;654;"Note the present tense ""is"" with the first movie, and the past tense ""was"" with the second?"
I:8380;655;Miss Congeniality is now the official first runner up on my comedies list.
I:8380;656;for one thing, the acting was superb.
I:8380;657;This was the first Sandra Bullock movie I saw, and I loved it.
I:8380;658;Michael Caine was excellent as always.
I:8380;659;Will Shatner also fit the part perfectly, as did Candice Bergan.
I:8380;660;for another, the writing was excellent.
I:8380;661;i won't spoil any surprises, but I loved Sandra's answer to the question at the contest.
I:8380;662;In fact, that fits my personality as well.
I:8380;663;i love movies about someone who has to rise to the occassion, and this is another that fits into that category.
I:8380;664;The ending was superb as well.
I:8380;665;'Cuz it's my first time to watch Sandra acting kinda comedy like this, I was really surprised to see how natural she is.
I:8380;666;I believe she has a talent to make people laugh.
I:8380;667;If you wanna have really fun time,it's the right one!!
I:8380;668;It is a very pleasant comedy with great performances, specially Sandra Bullock and Michel Caine.
I:8380;669;Both of them are real funny people but also good actors.
I:8380;670;time favorites, along with My Cousin Vinny , The Longest Day , Blues Brothers , Moonstruck , etc.
I:8380;671;I received what I thought I was going to receive.
I:8380;672;Therefore I am satisfied, and would recommend this to my friends.
I:8380;673;She's a fine and talented actress.
I:8380;674;This movie was also very humorous in various places.
I:8380;675;Not only a chick flick, but this one keeps you entertained through the entire movie.
I:8380;676;I would recommend this to a friend.
I:8380;677;I found this movie to be really enjoyable when Sandra Bullock's character was being transformed from an awkward klutz to a very confidant women.
I:8380;678;The makeover scenes were hilarious!
I:8380;679;This is a great light hearted movie that makes you laugh and feel good.
I:8380;680;Sandra Bullock is so funny in this movie!
I:8380;681;It's got some great messages for teenage girls about how you can be yourself and still be successful.
I:8380;682;Highly recommend any Sandra Bullock movie.
I:8380;683;She is a great entertainer!
I:8380;684;There's a reason why this funny Sandra Bullock movie is the favorite of so many women of various ages.
I:8380;685;In a very lighthearted way, it makes a statement about having it all and empowering yourself.
I:8380;686;the situations are I. love.
I:8380;687;Funny tale of a girl that never really fit in with her typical peers but never waivers on her beliefs and values.
I:8380;688;it's great for the whole family!
I:8380;689;It was funny and entertaining, not to mention that Sandra Bullock looked amazing on the runway!
I:8380;690;Sandra Bullock is one of my most favorite actress and this movie shows all of her charms!
I:8380;691;I always enjoy watching Sandra Bullock act.
I:8380;692;she is definitely a talented actress!
I:8380;693;The is a solid, fun comedy that passes the Mom and Dad test and the family repeat viewing test.
I:8380;694;This means that the whole family liked this movie and have watched it multiple times.
I:8380;695;There is no nudity and the language is acceptable.
I:8380;696;This one is family safe and fun!
I:8380;697;This movies is hilarious, it made me laugh so much.
I:8380;698;I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.
I:8380;699;If you love funny (not like hangover) comedy movies.
I:8380;700;Such a cute and funny movie.
I:8380;701;I watched it with my 9 year old and she also liked it a lot.
I:8380;702;I had watched this one before and liked it so well I watched it again.
I:8380;703;And I like Sandra Bullock, so it still gets 3 stars.
I:8380;704;Sandra Bullock produced as well as starred in this hilarious spoof of beauty contests.
I:8380;705;The supporting cast put in equally great and funny performances.
I:8380;706;very cooll and funny movie for adults and kids.
I:8380;707;you will enjoy it and maybe you will wanted watch it again
I:8380;708;A brilliant performance by Sandra Bullock in this light and entertaining film.
I:8380;709;Funny for the whole family.
I:8380;710;Sandra Bullock is really in rare form, and Benjamin Bratt, um.
I:8380;711;This is the perfect movie for groups.
I:8380;712;A classic action adventure romantic comedy.
I:8380;713;It's funny and well acted.
I:8380;714;I definately think That this was one of the top movies of all time.
I:8380;715;Sandra Bullock Knew EXACTELY what to do in this role, and I am inthralled by the wonderful Motion picture that has come out of it.
I:8380;716;This Movie deserves 1,000,000 stars!!
I:8380;717;I demonstrated that you can have what some perceive as a masculine job, but still be feminine.
I:8380;718;If you haven't seen this movie I reccomend you see it ASAP.
I:8380;719;It's a hilarious movie that also includes other actors and actresses such as Candace Bergen, William Shatner and more.
I:8380;720;This is a rare perfect date movie, especially when you get to the scene where Sandra includes Mr. Bratt in her pageant talent.
I:8380;721;(Because I recommend both, book and movie.
I:8380;722;week work vacation, and Sandra is a great companion.
I:8380;723;Watching an actual beauty pageant would of been deeper than this movie.
I:8380;724;this is a movie just for fans of Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;725;She executed all the tired gags with wit and charm.
I:8380;726;Good movie that I have seen many times.
I:8380;727;Sandra at her finest in a good movie to pass the time.
I:8380;728;I watched this with my 12 year old step daughter and she loved it too!!!
I:8380;729;Good movie to watch with tweens!
I:8380;730;good to watch with family or girlfriend.
I:8380;731;She is a nerdy FBI agent that gets transformed into a gorgeous pageant contestant.
I:8380;732;It's funny and it's fun!
I:8380;733;As always, Sandra Bullocks style is fantastic.
I:8380;734;Her way of combining emotional drama, elegant beauty, and physical slapstick comedy is unparalleled today.
I:8380;735;In this particular film, she leads a great cast including the comedic capability of Candice Bergen, the straight laced snarkiness of Michael Caine, and the bizarre antics of William Shatner.
I:8380;736;I laughed so hard as I watched it!
I:8380;737;Not only is Bullock terrific as Gracie Hart, but Candice Bergan, Michael Caine, and especially William Shatner shine as the supporting characters.
I:8380;738;but as I watched a great performance from Sandra Bullock, it was funnier, and funnier (or was that the libation?)
I:8380;739;This was funny because it was more wry humor, sarcastic if you will.
I:8380;740;I did enjoy this film, she brings a lot to it.
I:8380;741;Just the part of her fighting for the crown is worth watching the movie.
I:8380;742;sandra bullock is amazing as usual as gracie hart pulling off visual gags and one liners perfectly.
I:8380;743;michael cain was also really funny and with a cute benjamin bratt what else could u ask for in the way of entertainment.
I:8380;744;My perfect movie would have to include a good plot, GREAT acting, a lot of funny stuff, and a woman who can kick butt.
I:8380;745;That would be my perfect movie.
I:8380;746;And I got that perfect movie in Miss Congeniality.
I:8380;747;With the help of a pagaent talent instructor (Michael Caine), and a handful of comedic cops (inc.
I:8380;748;Gracie meets up with some interesting friends (most notably, Miss Rhode Island) and in the end, saves the pagaent.
I:8380;749;Miss Congeniality was thrown together in a fun way, and is a fun movie.
I:8380;750;All of the acting was great, and the comical moments were right on the moment.
I:8380;751;The two featurettes are filled with interviews from cast and crew, and are very interesting.
I:8380;752;The commentary by Sandra Bullock and screenwriter, Marc Lawrence, is thoroughly entertaining and hilarious.
I:8380;753;The video and audio transfers are great.
I:8380;754;Thank you ::sniff:: Thank you.
I:8380;755;Miss Congeniality is a great movie!
I:8380;756;It teaches a lesson that everyone can be beautiful on the inside.
I:8380;757;I recommend it to all viewers especially teenagers.
I:8380;758;I saw this movie in the theatres and I must say that it is one of the funniest I have ever seen.
I:8380;759;This was a good movie.
I:8380;760;It was fun to watch.
I:8380;761;Sandra Bullock was great, as usual.
I:8380;762;except for the magnificent surprise ending, the way things finally wrapped up between Gracie and Eric.
I:8380;763;The couple stays at odds throughout the film, and you absolutely will not believe how the relationship plot is resolved at the end.
I:8380;764;She is one of the talents of our time.
I:8380;765;Sandra Bullock does a believable and great job.
I:8380;766;For a fun easy movie, watch this movie.
I:8380;767;Overall excellent movie and service.
I:8380;768;One of the best Sandra has made .
I:8380;769;Bullock was starting to be a good actress in good films, but now she has turned to being a good actress in some good films.
I:8380;770;She really needs to pick it up to a great actress in brilliant movies, or her career will turn to cow poo.
I:8380;771;There are a couple of high.
I:8380;772;she and the writer come up with a terrific answer.
I:8380;773;We have rewatched this five times and it is still funny.
I:8380;774;mannered cop into a beauty pageant contestant in order to stop a crime.
I:8380;775;The movie highlights several interesting characters.
I:8380;776;It kept my attention and I liked it a lot!
I:8380;777;But I have to give Sandra a thumbs up sign for this.
I:8380;778;this is a great movie for a family night!
I:8380;779;This is an all time favorite.
I:8380;780;I love Sandra Bullock in this movie.
I:8380;781;She is hilarious and cleans up very well.
I:8380;782;Very funny movie that ALL members of the family can enjoy!
I:8380;783;Shows Sandra Bullocks'a great comedic style.
I:8380;784;funny and family appropriate, We have watched it several times and always laugh as much as the first time we saw it!
I:8380;785;she really does want world peace.
I:8380;786;funny quirky and all round great but heartwarming at the same time.
I:8380;787;There was intrigue too and great casting.
I:8380;788;Enjoyable, fun movie to watch.
I:8380;789;Was fun to rewatch this movie.
I:8380;790;She can do comedy, she can do drama, she can do light, she can do serious.
I:8380;791;"And, mind you, she is the prime example of 'grace under fire
I:8380;792;miss Michael Caine, and Mister William Shatner, salvage what they can from the lacklustre comedy and make it an interesting and entertaining movie.
I:8380;793;there is no doubt, Miss Congeniality is worth seeing.
I:8380;794;Bullock, Bergen, Caine, and Shatner are strained, but each put fine performances forward.
I:8380;795;in any event, Miss Congeniality is funny and an all.
I:8380;796;Despite the lack of a decent script and plot, I felt fully entertained throughout the movie.
I:8380;797;this was a sweet and funny movie.
I:8380;798;Nothing deep, just an entertaining comedy.
I:8380;799;Enjoyable and a good laugh.
I:8380;800;It is full of laughs and Sandra Bullock was the perfect person to take this role!
I:8380;801;She has to go undercover at the Miss United States Pagaent as Miss New Jersey.
I:8380;802;Sandra and Michael Caine are awesome together!
I:8380;803;Candice Bergen and William Shatner are also perfect in their roles.
I:8380;804;Only William Shatner could play the male co. host, he is hilarious!
I:8380;805;I would recommend this movie to anyone!
I:8380;806;This movie is one we watch whenever we need to smile, it always delivers.
I:8380;807;which actually was fairly good.
I:8380;808;It is amusing, and the characters are very well cast.
I:8380;809;Since then, I've realized (through this movie, among some others I've seen since) that she is a good actress, and can make any part her own.
I:8380;810;She does that with this movie.
I:8380;811;she can play both the frumpy FBI agent and the beauty queen.
I:8380;812;I'd never seen Benjamin Bratt before, and I was actually fairly pleasantly surprised.
I:8380;813;He was able to play his role as a tough guy with compassion.
I:8380;814;I've enjoyed Michael caine in other movies but I have never seen him as a comedic actor.
I:8380;815;farfetched comedy, like say, your life, would that be funny?
I:8380;816;This honestly is an amusing movie that I would recommend for anyone who is not so depressed that they actually can enjoy a frivolous piece every once in awhile, instead of just serious, influential pieces.
I:8380;817;Michael Caine, as a beauty pageant coach, is charged with the job of converting her to a believable contestant.
I:8380;818;He coaches her speech, and her walk and employs a team of beauty experts to complete the conversion.
I:8380;819;Once you turn off your brain and stop thinking about the story, it's actually quite good entertainment.
I:8380;820;it's just worth the entire movie.
I:8380;821;I laughed so much I thought I might never stop.
I:8380;822;I really love this movie.
I:8380;823;If you like movies like Legally Blonde and 13 Going on 30, this would be a great movie for you.
I:8380;824;I really enjoyed this movie!
I:8380;825;Very funny and not as crass as most modern movies.
I:8380;826;Great movie to watch for a girls night.
I:8380;827;Even if you are not a Sandra Bullock fan, it is definitely worth watching.
I:8380;828;I don't particularly favor one actor/tress over another, but I have seen this movie at least 50 times, an I laugh every time!
I:8380;829;Sandra Bullock is priceless as a frumpy Fed to a beauty contestant.
I:8380;830;I love when she walks out of the warehouse where she had her make over, walking great something funny then nearly trips.
I:8380;831;Very funny look at beauty, or should I say Scholarship pagents!
I:8380;832;Sandra Bullock is a great actress.
I:8380;833;We've probably watched this movie ten times or better and enjoy it every time.
I:8380;834;it's really a great movie and really funny.
I:8380;835;A fun, light, entertaining movie.
I:8380;836;Sandra Bullock is always great, and Michael Cain was superb.
I:8380;837;for a fun evening check it out.
I:8380;838;Seen this movie a million time.
I:8380;839;Great rom com love Sandra bullock in everything, even if she is not nominated for it
I:8380;840;and 49 other women in beautiful gowns and makeup and hair, it was every 90's girl dream.
I:8380;841;Funny, cute, solid chick flick.
I:8380;842;Sandra Bullock makes an excellent beauty pageant (I mean scholarship program) participant.
I:8380;843;I give it 5 stars.
I:8380;844;Sandra Bullock is great in this movie.
I:8380;845;It kept me laughing and entertained the whole movie.
I:8380;846;Loved Sandra Bullock in this movie!
I:8380;847;Her physical comedy was so much fun to watch.
I:8380;848;I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this delight of a film.
I:8380;849;It showcases the comedic talents of Sandra Bullock, who's also supported by a strong cast of other actors .
I:8380;850;I really enjoyed the moments in this film when Gracie Hart didn't quite get on top of the whole beauty pageant mentality, when she slipped out of character and lets the real person, flaws and all, show.
I:8380;851;Michael Caine is superb as the man behind the woman, playing a gay beauty consultant who is nearly overwhelmed by the challenge of transforming Bullock/Gracie Hart into a credible pageant contestant.
I:8380;852;There are some funny out takes, two documentaries, two feature.
I:8380;853;length audio commentaries (one with Bullock and co. screenwriter Mark Lawrence, the other with director Donald Petrie).
I:8380;854;Listening to her commentary, I felt like Bullock revealed a bit of the person behind the actress and this was a special treat.
I:8380;855;It's easy to forget about the probablem of the day when you're watching Sandra Bullock!
I:8380;856;Just really really fun as a wonderful diversion from everyday life!
I:8380;857;The humor in it makes me laugh hysterically.
I:8380;858;It's a perfect balance of chick.
I:8380;859;flick and comedy with a little adventure splashed in.
I:8380;860;I love this movie and watch it quite frequently.
I:8380;861;The girls were laughing and really enjoying the movie when it suddenly stopped.
I:8380;862;When I bought this movie, I forgot that I had already ordered it!
I:8380;863;This movie is funny and great to watch.
I:8380;864;We laugh from the beginning until the end.
I:8380;865;I recommend this movie if you want to watch something funny and romantic
I:8380;866;This film is funny and lighthearted.
I:8380;867;It has a wonderful cast.
I:8380;868;Sandra Bullock was beautiful as always.
I:8380;869;This film should appeal to anyone who likes a Cinderella story or a good makeover.
I:8380;870;There's just enough action and comedy to keep others from walking out of the room.
I:8380;871;It's one of the best films Sandra Bullock has made since Speed.
I:8380;872;if a movie is nice, funny, enjoyable, good or terrific, you will watch it again (and again).
I:8380;873;Any thing with Sandra Bullock is good.
I:8380;874;A little slapstick, a little cheeky but pure escapism and a good laugh.
I:8380;875;Thoroughly enjoyed it for about the 10th time.
I:8380;876;Film snobs, take note: not every director sets out to make The Great American Masterpiece of Film.
I:8380;877;something fun, that they like, that people will want to see, and will make a profit in the process.
I:8380;878;perfection, and so what if she's done it before?
I:8380;879;The script moves along at a brisk pace, and there are so many funny moments that I dare you not to remember some of them with a chuckle (or Gracie's snort.)
I:8380;880;The players blend well, with Benjamin Bratt and Miss Bullock exuding a neat chemistry.
I:8380;881;a treasure unto herself, who could carry the movie with her comedy talents alone.
I:8380;882;William Shatner continues his successful campaign to make us forget he ever piloted a starship: and frankly, he's very funny as a clueless Bert Parks clone.
I:8380;883;shop result in some very funny scenes.
I:8380;884;"and several quotable quotes (his wistful ""One brief, shining moment."
I:8380;885;Check it out.you'll have a great time at the Movies.
I:8380;886;Sandra Bullock always has and always will be a beautiful actress and one of the best
I:8380;887;Aaah, the joys of teenage sleepovers.
I:8380;888;Oh my god, this is a teriffic movie!
I:8380;889;The frazzled agent is made into a gorgeous model who, well, I don't want to spoil the ending.
I:8380;890;sandra Bullock and all her supporting cast are absolutely teriffic in this hilarious movie.
I:8380;891;This movie, whether you are young, old, or young at heart, is a great movie for you!
I:8380;892;Sandra Bullock is probably best known for her role in this movie.
I:8380;893;I'd give it a 10/5 if I could, but 100% of 5/5 will work just fine :) This movie is definitely for all you Sandra Bullock lovers out there!
I:8380;894;If you like Sandra Bullock and enjoy truly funny movies you will love this movie.
I:8380;895;Premise was a little shaky, but the physical humor and amazing transformation of Sandra made the movie worth watching.
I:8380;896;While I feel they attempted too much to be serious in parts, overall the movie is very funny and worth sitting down to watch.
I:8380;897;the movie was entertaining from beginning to end.
I:8380;898;I love Sandra Bullock and in this she definitely entertains with her wit and comedic presentation.
I:8380;899;I laughed all the way through this movie.
I:8380;900;"This is one of Sandra Bullocks best in my opinion because I haven't saw her in anything good since ""Speed""."
I:8380;901;Grace Hart is really a funny charcter but, Gracie Lou Freebush is just hilarious.
I:8380;902;I chose this movie frankly because I like most of the films starring Sandra Bullock she always gives it her all and she is easy on the eyes.
I:8380;903;Don't take it too seriously and you'll have fun with this one.
I:8380;904;Sandra Bullock is as cute as they come and pretty funny too.
I:8380;905;grab some popcorn, let your mind go and enjoy.
I:8380;906;Great movie I guess you have to like Sandra because This movie is all about Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;907;Definitely a movie worth owning.
I:8380;908;Sandra Bullock is a great actress.
I:8380;909;She did a great job in this role.
I:8380;910;This movie is cute and funny.
I:8380;911;I love sandra bullock's movies!!
I:8380;912;I like that it was good clean humor and always kept my attention.
I:8380;913;If you are a Sandra Bullock fan or a fan of any other actor in the movie, you would absolutely love it like I did!!
I:8380;914;One good thing about Miss Congeniality is that it is unique and unlike any other film .
I:8380;915;It's also a great spoof on beauty queens which makes it even more enjoyable.
I:8380;916;I love this movie, absolutely hysterical!
I:8380;917;It is Funny and exciting.
I:8380;918;It showcases Ms. Bullock's comedic talents, if nothing else.
I:8380;919;A beauty pageant coach, deliciously played by Michael Caine, is assigned to turn our erstwhile beast into a beauty.
I:8380;920;He succeeds admirably, as he has a lot with which to work.
I:8380;921;Still, she manages to charm.
I:8380;922;Her supporting cast, which includes Benjamin Bratt, as her fellow agent and potential love interest, and Candace Bergen and William Shatner, as the pageant hosts, act as comedic foils.
I:8380;923;The pageant contestants also provide a number of light hearted screen moments.
I:8380;924;I just love Sandra Bullock in this movie.
I:8380;925;The rest of the it gets no better as she engages in some sort of magical transformation to a beauty queen while secretly working for the FBI.
I:8380;926;The movie was hilariously funny.
I:8380;927;I love that they used some older actors and actresses in the show.
I:8380;928;I watched the movie again this week and was amazed how much I enjoyed it.
I:8380;929;Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses.
I:8380;930;I have seen this film several times, and always enjoy its writing and acting.
I:8380;931;Miss Congeniality is a bit of unadulterated fun.
I:8380;932;This is one of my all time favorites.
I:8380;933;Funny uplifting, can't get enough of Sandra Bullock's humor.
I:8380;934;A very good comedy, Miss Congeniality, brings to the screen the story of a female FBI agent who goes undercover as a contestant at a beauty pageant in an effort to avert a terrorist attack.
I:8380;935;sandra Bullock, William Shatner, Michael Caine and the rest of this WONDERFUL cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
I:8380;936;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
I:8380;937;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.
I:8380;938;Most of the movies Sandra Bullock plays in are really good and this is one of them.
I:8380;939;i would really recommend 28 days and Hope Floats with Sandra.
I:8380;940;It's a great movie !
I:8380;941;Very funny and you can enjoy It with family and friends.
I:8380;942;This was a laugh at loud.
I:8380;943;Then trainer as funny as can be trains her for The Miss. amerieca compition!
I:8380;944;We both enjoyed the movie and it was fairly clean for a PG.13 movie.
I:8380;945;this is a great girls movie.
I:8380;946;others like it are Legally Blonde,The Princess Diaries and Beautiful.
I:8380;947;This movie has great comedy.
I:8380;948;It also addresses some social bias towards stereo types, both male and female.
I:8380;949;Great performances by supporting actors.
I:8380;950;or good, for that matter .
I:8380;951;I like to watch funny movies.
I:8380;952;and this one was a lot of fun to watch.
I:8380;953;It was a real mystery .
I:8380;954;"And her ""cover"" is to be Miss New Jersey."
I:8380;955;But if you want a lot of laughs and fun, this movie is for you.
I:8380;956;It's a part made to order for Sandra Bullock, whose comedy talent I admire greatly.
I:8380;957;sexy, smart, a fantastic actor in whatever type of movie she stars in .
I:8380;958;as they say, All the world's a stage, and who does a better performance, in day.
I:8380;959;day life, than a consummate actor (actress) who understands that life is really all about acting .
I:8380;960;This is one of my favorites!
I:8380;961;It's funny, cute, and actually has a pretty good story line.
I:8380;962;Some laughs throughout the movie.
I:8380;963;Bullied is a natural .
I:8380;964;Sandra Bullock is a charm.
I:8380;965;You will definitely enjoy this fun loving entertaining movie.
I:8380;966;This is the coolest movie!
I:8380;967;Sandra Bullock gives are really great performance as an FBI agent turned Beauty Queen!
I:8380;968;I admire any woman who can handle herself and this woman can!
I:8380;969;This movie should be taken as is: a great little comedy that deserves lots of laughter!
I:8380;970;As my granddaughter is becoming a teenager it was really nice to watch this movie with her.
I:8380;971;She had never seen it and thought it was really good.
I:8380;972;A really nice movie compaired to all the violence and language in today's movies.
I:8380;973;Sandra Bullock is one of America's best loved actresses for a reason .
I:8380;974;she is genuine, not fake.
I:8380;975;I have seen several of her movies, and I love them all.
I:8380;976;Miss Congeniality is a hilarious comedy.
I:8380;977;It is that rare picture, that although it screams CHICK FLICK, is something men will roar with laughter at, too.
I:8380;978;My friend persuaded my husband to see it, and he LOVED it.
I:8380;979;Such wonderful supporting actors, including William Shatner, Michael Caine, and Candice Bergen, make the film even more delightful.
I:8380;980;This movie has slapstick, action, romance, everything.
I:8380;981;It is one of the best comedies ever, a true classic.
I:8380;982;I really think Sandra Bullock is a great actress and I have heard a lot of good reviews so I decided to watch this and it was pretty good.
I:8380;983;If you want laughs, a mystery and some cool music definetly get this movie.
I:8380;984;This movie is SOOO funny, Bullock does and extraordinary job in this comedy, of course, the story is really good too, even the music sequence in the pageant is amazing, I think this is one of the greatest comedies ever, and one of the finest movies of Sandra, you have to see this, you won't stop laughing.
I:8380;985;just a fun movie that once again proves Sandra can play anything.
I:8380;986;Sandra Bullock is hilarious in this entertaining movie.
I:8380;987;The rest of the cast is great and this movie will surely make you laugh.
I:8380;988;This movie is funny and Sandra Bullock is on point.
I:8380;989;William Shatner is bonus here too!
I:8380;990;It must be great to be Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;991;Producing this picture, and being able to have fun with it, and still make money!
I:8380;992;Sandra may not be a great actress, but she has real screen appeal, in the vein of Julia Roberts (who has more acting skill), because we feel she is real, and her personality shines through her characters.
I:8380;993;She deserved the Golden Globe, and should have a long romantic comedy career.
I:8380;994;Comedic timing and physical comedy?
I:8380;995;She can and does do it in this film.
I:8380;996;He has some great lines, and it feels as though he has fun with his role.
I:8380;997;Make sure they get to see Sandra in her charming commentary piece, and also check out the funny outtakes.
I:8380;998;Nevertheless, everyone in the family will get a few chuckles out of this feel good movie.
I:8380;999;with this success under her belt, although panned by many critics, hopefully Bullock will be able to bring us another While You Were Sleeping in the not too distant future.
I:8380;1000;Sandra Bullock is amazing in this movie!
I:8380;1001;It is one of the best.
I:8380;1002;Great movie by Sandra Bulock she is very funny in this movie its an old but a good one on Prime.
I:8380;1003;One to of my favorite movies ever!
I:8380;1004;Great comedy and Sandra Bullock is as funny as always.
I:8380;1005;up movie to this that is also worth watching.
I:8380;1006;I love this movie, Sandra Bullock will always have a special place on my shelf.1.
I:8380;1007;think things, gives a good perspective of women and relationships and just overall fun!
I:8380;1008;This was a great movie, one worth watching over and over.
I:8380;1009;Candice Bergen, William Shatner, and Michael Caine were hysterical and perfectly cast.
I:8380;1010;"Benjamin Bratt was an imperfect yet likeable ""hero""."
I:8380;1011;And Sandra Bullock was phenomenal!
I:8380;1012;Her transformation from klutzy FBI agent to klutzy beauty pageant contestant was a hoot to watch!
I:8380;1013;As someone who can trip walking across an empty room I really identified with her!
I:8380;1014;She's one of my favs and I loved her in this movie
I:8380;1015;This movie had every element that is included to make a blockbuster:good action packed scenes,a dash of romance,and an alter to the protagonist's normal setting,all wrapped together to form the perfect package!
I:8380;1016;If you are seeking a movie that will make you laugh,contains action and mystery,with a hint of romance and an altered girly setting,this movie has a chance at becoming your favorite!
I:8380;1017;Slapstick and Fun, Sandra Bullock takes us on a fun romp between the land of beauty pageants and law enforcement.
I:8380;1018;"The movie alternatively bashes the beauty contestants as well as the ""work in lieu of a life career type"" ."
I:8380;1019;an absolutely fun, family sort of entertainment that should only be approached by someone wanting a fun and lighthearted escape.
I:8380;1020;We just enjoyed the film, and the story line, which was ever so slightly along the line of My Fair Lady .
I:8380;1021;This was one of the best movies ive watched in a while thank you azon prime i love you :)
I:8380;1022;This movie is hilariouse, fun filled and 100% entertaining!
I:8380;1023;Miss Congeniality has a good plot and actually doesn't lack anywhere in this movie.
I:8380;1024;You thought Sandra was sexy in her other films.
I:8380;1025;wait until you see this one!
I:8380;1026;The premise is good and, with something other than slovenly writers, it could have been great fun.
I:8380;1027;snorting Sandra Bullock stuffing donuts in her bra hilarious.
I:8380;1028;I enjoyed it, but it doesn't stay with me today.
I:8380;1029;Well written and top notch performances by Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt.
I:8380;1030;Excellent comedy timing from Candace Bergen and Michael Caine.
I:8380;1031;Terrific spoof of beauty pageants.
I:8380;1032;This was a pretty good movie as comedies go.
I:8380;1033;it goes along the same lines as other comedies, first she screws up, funny parts, gets a new assignment, screws up more, more funny parts, and saves the winner of the beauty pagent from manical Candice Bergen, and her .
I:8380;1034;It'll make you laugh, and it's a good way to spend a rainy afternoon, but it is neither world class cinema, nor original.
I:8380;1035;notice the visual tributes to now classic cinema .
I:8380;1036;clone in form and style.
I:8380;1037;we finally got in at a 10:15 showing and I was pleasantly surprised.
I:8380;1038;the movie constantly had my attention and it kept me laughing.
I:8380;1039;it was a light and enjoyable comedy, reminiscent of Kindergarten Cop in many ways.
I:8380;1040;if you are in the mood for a light and funny comedy, I definitely recommend this one.
I:8380;1041;This movie will prove to be a classic in the years to come.
I:8380;1042;Good wholesome movie not like they turn out today.
I:8380;1043;Great upbeat movie that is hilarious!
I:8380;1044;Sandra Bullock is perfectly cast as not your typical woman working for the FBI!
I:8380;1045;It has a good story, great actors, and graphics.
I:8380;1046;It is a great film to laugh continously.
I:8380;1047;I hadn't seen it in a long time but it was as good as I remembered.
I:8380;1048;Enter, Sandra Bullock's character .
I:8380;1049;Mixed with the comedy are some very touching scenes with pageant participants and some very well acted comedic acting by Michael Caine as her pageant expert.
I:8380;1050;This movie will make you laugh out loud then will touch your heart.
I:8380;1051;after seeing Miss Congeniality, I actually developed an impressive list of symptoms which occur whenever I see Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;1052;The three most common are vomiting, muscle cramps, and uncontrollable fits of crying.
I:8380;1053;I like Sandra Bullock and I really enjoyed this movie and the laughs it gave me.
I:8380;1054;It's one of those feel good movies with no violence or raw sex.
I:8380;1055;My daughter and I love this movie.
I:8380;1056;We laughed so much and really enjoyed it!
I:8380;1057;We highly recommend you watch it.
I:8380;1058;A great cast, suspense and comedy done with final action.
I:8380;1059;It keeps you interested and guessing but with a sense of humor to boot.
I:8380;1060;Sandra Bullock does her best.
I:8380;1061;There are certain movies where an actor in a supporting role makes the movie a success.
I:8380;1062;In Miss Congeniality it is Michael Caine who makes the movie much more entertaining than it might otherwise have been.
I:8380;1063;Sandra Bullock always a great actress.
I:8380;1064;My wife loves this movie and was ecstatic when it came out on Prime.
I:8380;1065;Classic movie always worth watching again.
I:8380;1066;It was pretty funny and a good mixture of some other things that really make it work.
I:8380;1067;(Bratt) She has to look the part of the contestant so she hires Victor(Caine) to help her.
I:8380;1068;the movie works pretty well one of the main reasons is the great cast.
I:8380;1069;sandra Bullock is terrific in the film.
I:8380;1070;It's amazing what makeup can do to a woman.
I:8380;1071;She is so believable and unattractive as the tomboy.
I:8380;1072;"When she comes out though decked out and they have Tom Jones ""She's A Lady"" playing you really have a big draw dropper."
I:8380;1073;She put a lot of energy into the part and she also produced it.
I:8380;1074;She believed in the project and it was a big success because of her.
I:8380;1075;michael Caine was awesome in the film.
I:8380;1076;His character in the movie is a homosexual and Caine takes the part and runs with it.
I:8380;1077;He is believable as the pageant expert.
I:8380;1078;Caine is such a great actor because he can play with emotions.
I:8380;1079;He goes from serious to flamboyant all the time in this movie and its fun.
I:8380;1080;It's a fun character for him and he's fantastic in the film.
I:8380;1081;guys you will want to watch the movie for the girls.
I:8380;1082;There are a ton of beautiful woman in it.
I:8380;1083;Almost all of the actresses who play the contestants are gorgeous woman.
I:8380;1084;Bullock looks great in the film and there are plenty of things that you will find funny.
I:8380;1085;I was quite impressed with it and im not ashamed to say I own it.
I:8380;1086;It's a great film that can be enjoyed by all.
I:8380;1087;Miss Congeniality is an affable comedy which is pleasant enough to watch.
I:8380;1088;what Miss Congeniality does succeed at is slapstick, and some of this is very funny.
I:8380;1089;She also have a problem with anger management, and this sets up one of the movie's funniest scenes.
I:8380;1090;This scene shows us that this is the way Hart's life has gone so far.
I:8380;1091;A beauty pageant 'expert' [Michael Caine] has forty.
I:8380;1092;It is neither original nor very bright, but it has a great deal of energy and several amusing scenes.
I:8380;1093;It is greatly helped by the presence of Mr. Caine, as well as by Candice Bergen as the pageant's director.
I:8380;1094;Their scenes with Ms. Bullock are great, and one can only wish that Miss Congeniality's writing talent had been on par with its acting talent.
I:8380;1095;Miss Congeniality was a funny and entertaining movie.
I:8380;1096;Sandra Bullock Benjamon Bratt had great chemistry.
I:8380;1097;My fiance even enjoyed it!
I:8380;1098;(He thought it would be a Chick Flick when we went to go see it, but he laughed just as much as I did!!)
I:8380;1099;i know a lot of you film lovers liked this one, but ther was something mising here for me, may be creativity.
I:8380;1100;What this latter Sandra Bullock film proves that she can truly stand her ground and deliver an even better film than her insipid 28 Days.
I:8380;1101;This comedic look at FBI agents going undercover as beauty pageant contestants is funnier than it sounds, with Michael Caine and the ever.
I:8380;1102;likeable Sandra Bullock the two main standouts.
I:8380;1103;the script is dysfunctional, yet predictable, but the movie is so funny and Bullock sparkles as the lead role, you'll forget about it and go with the flow.
I:8380;1104;I don't normally like this kind of film, but in this one, the heroine is adorable, gutsy, and funny.
I:8380;1105;And I do like rags to Cinderella stories.
I:8380;1106;The best comedy moments are thus supplied by Michael Caine's Victor Melling teaching Gracie how to act like a beauty queen.
I:8380;1107;The script is quite limp and to their credit the cast do well with what there is.
I:8380;1108;Sandra Bullock is still as watchable as ever and along with Michael Caine saves the film.
I:8380;1109;Maybe it's just me but I found her as attractive at the start as I did at the end.
I:8380;1110;I did not hate this film and any Sandra Bullock fan (myself included) will be more than happy to put up with the inadaquacies in the film.
I:8380;1111;But she deserves much better and I can only hope that her next film delivers.
I:8380;1112;Great when you want a good laugh.
I:8380;1113;Sandra Bullock was very funny and I did believe that she wanted world peace.
I:8380;1114;Does anyone remember Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and all those feel good dance movies?
I:8380;1115;i think the problem in most minds is that this is a beauty pageant.
I:8380;1116;I think the premise was good, the writing fair and the acting engaging.
I:8380;1117;Not the best film in all the world, but it surely is upbeat and fanciful.
I:8380;1118;I enjoyed it and felt better after watching it.
I:8380;1119;My dark moods are gone and I see a little bit more light in the world.
I:8380;1120;That is what the major part of entertainment is about.
I:8380;1121;In the range of audience involvement there should be a place for people to just enjoy beauty and fun, to enjoy simple thought and action, to not have to balance all the politicos of the world.
I:8380;1122;The simple sentiments of friendship and devotion are laudable.
I:8380;1123;Making life a bit lighter seems like a good idea to me.
I:8380;1124;true formula, of what she does best: act like she probably does in real life!
I:8380;1125;Nice little something to add to her CV.
I:8380;1126;now does it?I'll always love this movie.
I:8380;1127;The transformation from unkempt Gracie, to HOT Gracie leaves you wanting that team working on you!
I:8380;1128;(I hate it when they do that) But of the one commentary I've watched of a movie, this one is the best.
I:8380;1129;Sandy and Marc just seem to laugh right the way through it.
I:8380;1130;watch the film, you'll remember certain parts of the commentary (I always remember Sandy saying about Frank Tobain's little dance, when they all walk out on stage for the first part of the beauty pageant)The soundtrack is also terrific (I own it).
I:8380;1131;"There's some terrific songs, including the most memorable scene, whilst ""Mustang Sally"" plays."
I:8380;1132;It also looks like she's pretty much poured into it!
I:8380;1133;(The lucky thing)This movie is terrific.
I:8380;1134;This is definitely in my top five movies.
I:8380;1135;Special mention for Candice Bergman's performance but Bullock is good as well and is very funny.
I:8380;1136;Also Michael Caine as the gay beauty consultant is priceless.
I:8380;1137;Miss Congeniality is one of the movies that I can always re.
I:8380;1138;I loved it the first time, and I still do :)
I:8380;1139;This film is thoroughly enjoyable and utterly hilarious.
I:8380;1140;this movie is all about fun.
I:8380;1141;The script is blessed with witty dialogue.
I:8380;1142;and some of the one liners, have to be heard to be believed, especially those Michael Cain ( who plays Bullock's pageant coach ) has the luck to deliver.
I:8380;1143;screen chemistry between Bullock and Bratt,the romance angle is well covered.
I:8380;1144;overall, this is a most delightful, uplifting comedy, that delivers when it comes to laughs.
I:8380;1145;Caine is at his comedic best, Bratt gives it his all, and Bullock shines.
I:8380;1146;This is a great family movie I recommend getting yoyr daughters together and some snacks and making it a movie night.
I:8380;1147;I really enjoy Sandra Bullock, she does a good job with this role.
I:8380;1148;A fun chick flick and a good laugh!
I:8380;1149;"one of my favorites
I:8380;1150;one of my favorite movies and would recommend to others!
I:8380;1151;If you like feel good movies watch this .
I:8380;1152;Miss Congeniality, I thought was one of the funniest movies out in a long time.
I:8380;1153;It was funny from the beginning to the end.
I:8380;1154;this was one of Sandra Bullock's best movies out, to date.
I:8380;1155;It is the kind of comedy that you can just laugh along with, even if it wasn't the most realistic at times.
I:8380;1156;This one lets you forget about everything areound you and just enjoy it.
I:8380;1157;Bullock is very funny here and so is Bergen.
I:8380;1158;The other federal agents have fun making sport of Gracie the whole time which makes her even more cranky.
I:8380;1159;There is some good natured ribbing of beaty pageants and contestants here, not to mention the people that run them.
I:8380;1160;"Also funny is the fact that every contestant has to mention wanting the ever popular item ""world peace."
I:8380;1161;This is a good film to put on when you've seen everything in your library a million times or when you just want to take your mind off of things, relax and laugh.
I:8380;1162;Most reviewers seem to agree that if you suspend your credibility expectations and enjoy this frothy romp for what it is, then MISS CONGENIALITY is okay.
I:8380;1163;I enjoyed watching the film, but didn't laugh as much as I would have expected.
I:8380;1164;Sandra Bullock is a competent actress, smart enough to know what she does well and what her fan base wants from her.
I:8380;1165;Going from the rather unfeminine workaholic nerd to the potentially sophisticated beauty, Bullock works her part heartily and seems to be having a good time.
I:8380;1166;"The fellow pageant hopefuls are fun at times, but Cheryl's stupidity (When William Shatner asks her about her ideal ""perfect date,"" she comes up with something like ""April 21."")"
I:8380;1167;A fun if forgettable flick!
I:8380;1168;Sure it's sappy and almost predictable, but sometimes that is exactly what one wants.
I:8380;1169;Besides, the cast is top rated and they do a fine job.
I:8380;1170;Though the plot is basic and predictable it is still a good movie to watch at home.
I:8380;1171;Sandra Bullock is always does a good job.
I:8380;1172;I thought this movie was great for what it is, a comedy.
I:8380;1173;It is funny, has action, and a happy ending.
I:8380;1174;We are really enjoying downloading movies from Amazon .
I:8380;1175;This movie is so funny and Sandra Bullock is awesome in this movie.
I:8380;1176;I would recommend this to anyone who loves her movies.
I:8380;1177;I've seen this several times and I still get a chuckle watching it.
I:8380;1178;Sandra Bullock is a very versatile actress and doesn't disappoint in this movie.
I:8380;1179;Still a very good show!
I:8380;1180;Good music in this one also.
I:8380;1181;Sandra Bullock is hilarious in this fun movie!
I:8380;1182;She's so believable as a person who has no business being at a beauty pageant.
I:8380;1183;There are many many fun moments.
I:8380;1184;I loved this when I saw it and even after watching it three times, I still enjoyed it so I went and bought it.
I:8380;1185;This is a delighful comedy which anyone can enjoy over and over.
I:8380;1186;Sandra Bullock is in fine comedic form here, and her stellar costars also perform admirably.
I:8380;1187;If you're not a fan you may very well become one after Miss Congeniality charms her way into your heart.
I:8380;1188;Lots of eye candy for the boys and timeless beauty tips for the girls.
I:8380;1189;This is lighthearted fun without being too fluffy and there's an actual plot too!
I:8380;1190;I thought this movie was the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time.
I:8380;1191;It has great action, some suspence and lots of comedy great movie I recconmend it to everyone.
I:8380;1192;I went into this movie with rather low expectations and it was very good.
I:8380;1193;down give your mind a rest day.
I:8380;1194;Not Sandra Bullock's best, but fun to watch.
I:8380;1195;I have always loved this movie.
I:8380;1196;Every time I watch this, I find myself in fits of laughter.
I:8380;1197;She's the epitome of a tomboy.
I:8380;1198;deprived enigma into beauty pageant material.
I:8380;1199;this is definitely one of the better comedies produced in the last few years, and provides non.
I:8380;1200;Sandra Bullock, who also produced the film, is at her comedic best.
I:8380;1201;She really pours herself into the role and lets herself go, providing both verbal and physical comedy.
I:8380;1202;The supporting cast is also great, including Benjamin Bratt as Gracie's fellow FBI agent Eric Matthews, Michael Caine as pageant consultant Victor Melling, Candice Bergen as pageant director Kathy Morningside, William Shatner as announcer Stan Fields, and Heather Burns as fellow contestant Miss Rhode Island.
I:8380;1203;"though ""chick flick"" is certainly the category this movie would fall under, ""Miss Congeniality"" has the potential to appeal to a wider audience."
I:8380;1204;I saw this film twice in theaters, first with my father and then with a group of friends that included a guy.
I:8380;1205;Both enjoyed it just as much as I did, and judging by the number of positive reviews here from male viewers, they are not alone.
I:8380;1206;And heck, even if the plotline and comedy element aren't enough to keep the guys interested, there are always 50 gorgeous women to hold their attention!
I:8380;1207;Bonus Features include cast and crew filmographies, one feature.
I:8380;1208;"But, packaging issues aside, ""Miss Congeniality"" is a great movie that I'd recommend to anyone."
I:8380;1209;Gracie must place in the top five.
I:8380;1210;After due reluctance, Ms. Morningside gives in to the agency's request.
I:8380;1211;Gracie convinces him that he must help her to at least place in the top five due to the necessity of protecting the pageant as well as catching the individual who may be hidden on the inside of the pageant.
I:8380;1212;Agent Eric Matthews helps her along the way with the ups and downs of becoming a woman and finding out what a wonderful asset she is to the agency.
I:8380;1213;Every candidate wants to be a winner and they all want world peace.
I:8380;1214;I rate this movie five stars because it has everything in it a comedy should have: laughter, tears, sarcasm, slapstick, romance, and talent.
I:8380;1215;It was delivered in good time and good condition.
I:8380;1216;It's credit to her acting abilities that the audience roots for her throughout.
I:8380;1217;It's the hilarious skit on beauty pageants that really gives this movie its sparkle.
I:8380;1218;it's fair to say that such things are easy to take off, but in parts this film is genuinely funny without having to resort to toilet or gross.
I:8380;1219;Yet there are some great supporting roles from the other girls (Michael Caine and Benjamin Bratt are just passable) that give the film that warm fuzzy and light feeling that appealed it to the watchers.
I:8380;1220;more importantly, this gives Sandra Bullock another chance to break Hollywood again.
I:8380;1221;Her performances in films such as `Speed' show that she has what's needed to become the next Julia Roberts .
I:8380;1222;I do own this movie, but I shared it with my sister.
I:8380;1223;Loved her in The Blind Side, Gravity and I enjoyed this one as well.
I:8380;1224;it was great movie and i love sandra bullock.
I:8380;1225;i've seen many of her movies and this is one of the best.
I:8380;1226;Watch it if you like to laugh.
I:8380;1227;Good movie to add to have.
I:8380;1228;It will make you laugh.
I:8380;1229;It's still a fun movie.
I:8380;1230;Really interesting film that I watched.
I:8380;1231;The love story is about a girl have faith in her job and friendships.
I:8380;1232;Sandra Bullock plays to her strengths and makes this an enjoyable girls night movie.
I:8380;1233;As a devoted Bullock fan this movie is a must see.
I:8380;1234;I laughed until I cried, and Sandra is a lovable bumbling FBI agent transformed into a beautiful but funny swan.
I:8380;1235;Definitely one to own, as the laughter should keep coming.
I:8380;1236;Refreshing entertainment in a sea of heavy movies.
I:8380;1237;This movie is the best movie i've ever seen I love it sandra bullock is a great actress this movie was so funny benjemin bratt and sandra bullock are the best
I:8380;1238;Loved this movie since it came out Sandra is my all time favorite actress and she really is amazing on this one
I:8380;1239;I like this over Two Weeks Notice which is also very good (I'd rate it 4 stars though).
I:8380;1240;For a comedy, Miss Congeniality, is so good.
I:8380;1241;We had so much fun watching it together.
I:8380;1242;There is action, comedy, romance, and just good clean fun.
I:8380;1243;This movie has some great comedy.
I:8380;1244;All of the stars are GREAT!
I:8380;1245;Agent Gracie Hart learns quite a bit about herself!
I:8380;1246;This is no masterpiece but if you're in the mood for a good chick flick, this one's lots of fun.
I:8380;1247;A very fun comedy action flick.
I:8380;1248;Just the right amount of romance without being overpowering.
I:8380;1249;Miss Congeniality , starring Sandra Bullock, is a movie that the world will be talking about for years to come.
I:8380;1250;piece swimsuits, celery, and world peace?
I:8380;1251;Good for laughs when you need a smile or are already in the mood.
I:8380;1252;Add a Sandra Bullock and a hott guy and well you got yourself something worth seeing again and again.
I:8380;1253;Sandra bullock, is an amazing actress.
I:8380;1254;This movie, is a true comedy.
I:8380;1255;If you need a something to make you smile, watch it.
I:8380;1256;Sandra Bullock is wonderful in this role!
I:8380;1257;Refreshing to be able to watch a movie that is not loaded with curse words.
I:8380;1258;This movie is one of the best of Sandra Bullock's many productions.
I:8380;1259;The way she handles herself in a venue out of her normal area is hilareous.
I:8380;1260;I like Sandra Bullock, she's fun and at the same time you can see a working thoughtfulness to her.
I:8380;1261;Perhaps as she grows older she'll mature into parts that aren't so.
I:8380;1262;easy on the thought process but for now she serves a purpose.
I:8380;1263;Like a Star Trek novel, fun, light entertainment where you can genuinely see that she is a good actress and cares about her work.
I:8380;1264;Her and Benjamin Bratt have a nice chemistry and Candace Bergen who will never regain her former soft acting style after Murphy Brown makes a great villain.
I:8380;1265;Michael Caine is fun as Sandra's beauty coach and Sandra mocking the whole beauty industry for having beauty contests (It's about the scholarship!)
I:8380;1266;Sanda Bullock doesn't disappoint and Benjamin Bratt is also wonderful.
I:8380;1267;worthy, but a nice escape, happy movie.
I:8380;1268;A very entertaining and funny movie.
I:8380;1269;I've seen it before but enjoyed seeing it again.
I:8380;1270;It's good to know that if I want I can watch it again free!
I:8380;1271;I recommend watching this movie once a year followed by the sequel.
I:8380;1272;i waited a long time to see this and I'm glad that I got to see it on amazon.
I:8380;1273;i recommend this service to anyone :)
I:8380;1274;An acfion/comedy with fun characters.
I:8380;1275;I enjoy all type of movies, but when it's about comedy, my mind turns instantly to this movie.
I:8380;1276;I'm sure I know almost all the dialogues and yet I still find myself laughing once and again at the hilarious scenes presented in Miss Congeniality.
I:8380;1277;sandy Bullock manages to play at first, the most un.
I:8380;1278;But its thanks to non other than Caine, that Bullock transforms into Gracie Lou Freebush, Miss New Jersey and candidate to win Miss USA pageant.
I:8380;1279;this movies purpose is no other than to entertain and give the audience a good time.
I:8380;1280;I'm pretty sure it fullfills it undoubtedly.
I:8380;1281;This movie kind of grows on you.
I:8380;1282;It's silly in places, but overall, it's fun to watch.
I:8380;1283;Best movie to watch if you wanna have a good time
I:8380;1284;I am being generous with the one star I give it.
I:8380;1285;pageant beautiful in order to get the good looking guy.
I:8380;1286;solid laughs for the whole family.
I:8380;1287;Funny, original, and has heart.
I:8380;1288;One of those movies I can easily watch on TV for the 100th time and still find entertaining.
I:8380;1289;Sandra Bullock is amazingly stunning!!!!!!
I:8380;1290;She is Sexy and a great actor .
I:8380;1291;She is a great human being.
I:8380;1292;always love to watch sandra bullack on screen this is one of her great ones really enjoyed watching with daughter
I:8380;1293;First, the talent competition of the contestant making baloons reminded me of a real Miss America contestant singing she wanted to be a secretary.
I:8380;1294;Miss Texas just was wonderful in her dissapointment scene.
I:8380;1295;This was hilarious and moved along very well.
I:8380;1296;This is a really cute movie.
I:8380;1297;Miss Congeniality kept moving and had lots of humor.
I:8380;1298;Truly a wonderful funny movie.
I:8380;1299;I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys comedy's.
I:8380;1300;Sandra Bullock is at her best!
I:8380;1301;Doesn't take itself too seriously and has lots of fun and action.
I:8380;1302;I enjoyed being able to watch the movie on my Kindle.
I:8380;1303;It's great to be able to watch anywhere I happen to be.
I:8380;1304;Miss Congeniatlity is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8380;1305;Sandrea bullick really rocks in this movie, and it is good for more than a few laughs.
I:8380;1306;The actors/actresses in this movie does an exelent job.
I:8380;1307;And both the plotline and writing is good.
I:8380;1308;and the movie is funny.
I:8380;1309;and it will have you laughing more then once!
I:8380;1310;Michal cain, sandra bullock and william shattner all does a wonderfull job in this well amde comedy.
I:8380;1311;This is a funny movie that will have you rolling on the floor laughing.
I:8380;1312;Sandra's Co. star Bejamin Bratt also brings this comedy to life.
I:8380;1313;There are some funny moments and I would rather you watch it than me give it away.
I:8380;1314;I agree with the reviewer, Steven Jones, and his comments about the grotesque violence of this film and how it's supposed to be cute.
I:8380;1315;"So, a film with beatings and other violence here and there is considered part of a film that's ""fun for the whole family"" and a ""great escape."""
I:8380;1316;Escape from what. . . peace?
I:8380;1317;It makes one think of those scenes at Abu Ghraib, and how much fun Lindy England was having while she beat on other human beings.
I:8380;1318;then there is the issue of beauty pagents.
I:8380;1319;"They've been seeking to increase sales to the female market, and having Bullock parade around with a gun strapped to her thigh provides effective moments of ""guerrilla"" marketing."
I:8380;1320;"As if Bullock's gun modelling wasn't enough, she has to have a line about how, ""This is Texas, everyone has guns,"" a classic sales line."
I:8380;1321;And for another source on how to boost female self.
I:8380;1322;"esteem in more profound ways than dressing them up like a sex fantasy of a Smith and Wesson executive, I'd recommend ""Teen Voices"" and ""New Moon: A Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams."
I:8380;1323;One last comment, this film also provides good public relations for the FBI.
I:8380;1324;We should keep in mind that organization's history of anti.
I:8380;1325;"See, for instance, the book ""COINTELPRO"" by Ward Churchill."
I:8380;1326;I found it extremely funny and entertaining, though as some people have pointed out the plot is nothing spectacular.
I:8380;1327;sandra Bullock is exceptionally good, playing the part of Gracie Hart, FBI agent.
I:8380;1328;She is incredibly good, her humor is given off to perfection.
I:8380;1329;Benjamin Bratt is great as another FBI agent and the chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock was well.
I:8380;1330;Their bantering is so fun to watch.
I:8380;1331;Michael Caine should also be mentioned since he is wonderful as Gracie's 'trainer'.
I:8380;1332;as I said, Miss Congeniality is incredibly funny, filled with one.
I:8380;1333;liners and favorite scenes you would love.
I:8380;1334;A few of my favorite lines and parts are: 1) When the agents use a 'Dress up Sally' program to dress up agents on the computer.
I:8380;1335;6) I love it when Sandra Bullock says to Eric, You think I'm gorgeous.
I:8380;1336;I thought that that was very cute and the way she says it is so funny!And lots, lots more!
I:8380;1337;But a very enjoyable movie to watch though as I said the plot is nothing spectacular.
I:8380;1338;This has got to be the best comedy so far!
I:8380;1339;It's funny, cute, hysterical and Sandra Bullock is the best!
I:8380;1340;This movie is good for young and old alike!
I:8380;1341;I would highly recommend this this movie to anyone and everyone!!
I:8380;1342;This is kind of a chick flick, but my husband enjoyed it too!
I:8380;1343;A wonderful study in comic characters .
I:8380;1344;Even though I have seen this before, it is still a pleasant way to pass an afternoon in the dialysis chair.
I:8380;1345;Sandra Bullock performance is sexy and great as usual and the whole movie is very entertaining.
I:8380;1346;I have always enjoyed her movies and performance in them.
I:8380;1347;It is a good movie with lots of laughs.
I:8380;1348;This was a very good movie.
I:8380;1349;A chic flic most of us guys would even enjoy watching.
I:8380;1350;A fun funny movie .
I:8380;1351;Sandra has the capability to act, including comedy.
I:8380;1352;I have always liked this movie and enjoyed watching it on my Kindle Fire.
I:8380;1353;It's nice to see that good movies can always help people to learn how to use certain aspects of an enjoyable product.
I:8380;1354;I was pleasantly surprised to see that playing a movie on my Kindle Fire didn't drain its battery life like I thought it would.
I:8380;1355;"Very funny and enjoyable
I:8380;1356;Sandra Bulllock is at her best playing these kinds of comedy roles.
I:8380;1357;Every woman can relate to this laugh out loud comedy.
I:8380;1358;Bllock plays an amazingly real role.
I:8380;1359;The commentaries are fun to listen to also.
I:8380;1360;Some are so boaring and dry but you really learn a lot about the movie and behind the scenes.
I:8380;1361;This is the best role I've seen Sandra Bullock do since Practical Magic.
I:8380;1362;It also proves that you never judge a book by its cover.
I:8380;1363;The ugliest can sometimes prove to be the beautiful roses.
I:8380;1364;cute premise, fun appearances by some older names (william shatner, candice bergen, michael caine.)
I:8380;1365;This show is a great feel good movie.
I:8380;1366;Makes me laugh a lot, every time!
I:8380;1367;I recommend this to everyone.
I:8380;1368;I have watched it a couple of times before and still enjoy it.
I:8380;1369;Sandra Bullock is very hilarious.
I:8380;1370;Again, another one of Sandra's most excellent works ever.
I:8380;1371;Really connects with the audience.
I:8380;1372;A definite force just by herself, really puts herself into the part she's playing.
I:8380;1373;Always can count on Sandy for a performance to remember.
I:8380;1374;My wife and I enjoyed every minute of it.
I:8380;1375;Sandra Bullock is a very talented actress and delivers comedy as well as anyone.
I:8380;1376;My husband and I watch this movie and found it fun to watch.
I:8380;1377;Sandra Bullock did a good acting job in the movie.
I:8380;1378;It seemed she was perfect for the part.
I:8380;1379;The movie kept us interested in involved.
I:8380;1380;It was just a fun movie.
I:8380;1381;One of my favorite movies.
I:8380;1382;It makes me laugh everytime!
I:8380;1383;Ms. Bullock is fun to watch, and a great comedian.
I:8380;1384;There is just the right mix of sympathy for the heroine, and nervousness about what she might do next.
I:8380;1385;sandra Bullock is wonderful in this film.
I:8380;1386;I barely knew who she was, but by the end of the film I was a big fan.
I:8380;1387;She makes it all worthwhile.
I:8380;1388;She could have played the part opposite cardboard cutouts and made it worth watching.
I:8380;1389;Still there are moments of fun for those looking for light entertainment.
I:8380;1390;Fun movie, good humor and acting.
I:8380;1391;Family enjoyed watching this movie, had many laughs.
I:8380;1392;Sandra Bullock was a joy to see.
I:8380;1393;Getting past the impossibility of making Sandra Bullock look ugly is a tall chore, but it's a fun movie.
I:8380;1394;"She was gorgeous even when she was ""plain""."
I:8380;1395;An amusing way to kill a few hours.
I:8380;1396;Probably seemed funnier to me because I live in Texas, where the culture of the beauty pageant is alive and well.
I:8380;1397;Pratfalls and snorty laughter, Sandra (Austin's Sweetheart) Bullock's stock.
I:8380;1398;Fortunately, the irrepressible Miss Bullock's considerable comedic talents raise the script beyond itself.
I:8380;1399;this is very entertaining and revealing and is frequently much funnier than the movie itself.
I:8380;1400;Seen it a million of times and always makes me laugh.
I:8380;1401;Well written script, good cast of characters.
I:8380;1402;Although I know little or nothing about Sandra's personal life, it strikes me that in real life she is much like the characters she portrays: deeply sensitive, considerate of others, self.
I:8380;1403;"The dynamics of her acting range from the deeply poignant, as in ""28 Days"", to the new, outrageously comical, ""Miss Congeniality"", which she produced."
I:8380;1404;She is simply hilarious in portraying her role.
I:8380;1405;Maybe it's my imagination, but I swear Sandra gets better with every film she makes .
I:8380;1406;Miss Congeniality is bone splitting funny and I sat roaring with laughter, wishing the film would go on forever.
I:8380;1407;If you like to laugh, watch this flick.
I:8380;1408;I recommend it will make you laugh and it's a great story Sandra Bullockwas awesome in this movie.
I:8380;1409;the acting is good, the comedy and humor is likeable.
I:8380;1410;i've seen it several times, and each time it is enjoyable.
I:8380;1411;if you are a Sandra Bullock fan, you will enjoy this film.
I:8380;1412;If you liked Speed , While you were sleeping or other such roles of hers, you will like this one.
I:8380;1413;So, nuke some popcorn, get your feet off the ground, lean back, and have some fun.
I:8380;1414;This is one of those movies that the more you think about it, the less you will enjoy it.
I:8380;1415;But if you cut it a lot of slack and don't worry about the gaps, it will be fun.
I:8380;1416;i mean, how seriously can you take a film where you take an FBI agent and insert her into a beauty pageant, especially one where they replace Miss New Jersey with someone who never participated in the Miss New Jersey pageant?
I:8380;1417;the miracle of this film is that it is a lot of fun despite a lot of bad things you can say about it.
I:8380;1418;Some actors and actresses have personalities that manage to shine even when doing a poor job, and that is true of Sandra in this one.
I:8380;1419;He is incapable of doing a bad job, but it is hard to believe that this was the best script that was laid before him at this particular moment in his career.
I:8380;1420;Anyone who has seen his recent and stunning Oscar.
I:8380;1421;nominated performance in THE QUIET AMERICAN will doubt that he remains one of the most gifted and professional actors in the world.
I:8380;1422;Anyone willing to cut it a few miles of slack will enjoy it.
I:8380;1423;That may sound paradoxical, but it is also true.
I:8380;1424;Very entertaining movie I sat down and got my little bag of popcorn and enjoyed every minute of the movie
I:8380;1425;one of few actresses i love with small breasts.
I:8380;1426;her beauty is in her face and acting.
I:8380;1427;Nice movie Sandra is terrific in this.
I:8380;1428;she'll cast and extremely funny.
I:8380;1429;Miss Congeniality is a comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Michael Caine.
I:8380;1430;She is picked to go undercover at a beauty pagaent for some FBI mission.
I:8380;1431;there are however, some pretty funny jokes that go along with the whole beauty pagaent, such as the talent part and the dressing up to go on stage and everything.
I:8380;1432;It would be a good choice if you have seen all of the biggest comedies, and want a comedy, of course
I:8380;1433;Sandra Bullock is good at almost everyone she does.
I:8380;1434;Good script, good acting, very enjoyable picture.
I:8380;1435;Its obvious Mark and Sandra have great chemistry together as they power through the entire film, making fun of each other's writing and acting ability and moments in the film itself in good old fashioned Mystery Science Theater style.
I:8380;1436;They are spontaneous, witty, and truly charming.
I:8380;1437;All the qualities you hope to find in a Sandra Bullock film.
I:8380;1438;Watch it this way instead.
I:8380;1439;The story line is absolutely hilarious .
I:8380;1440;Sandra does a great job in the beginning of the movie convincing the audience she is not 'frilly and feminine' .
I:8380;1441;I especially love the scene with Michael Caine in the restuarant.
I:8380;1442;if you want a good laugh.
I:8380;1443;Not the least bit scary once you found out the gorgeous Candace Bergen was the villain.
I:8380;1444;Save your time and watch L. A. Confidential again if you are in the mood for a good story.
I:8380;1445;"Although I don't expect each and every one of them to be of the caliber of ""My Fair Lady,"" it still amazes me how such a profoundly clever and witty source work can result in so many lowbrow and humorless imitations."
I:8380;1446;If Shaw was nothing else, he was a brilliant writer of scintillating dialogue.
I:8380;1447;her innate sweetness and charm.
I:8380;1448;she is such a great actress!
I:8380;1449;She is hilarious in this and I can watch it each year and still laugh out loud!
I:8380;1450;"She said,""I'm okay I'm in a dress and armed don't mess with me or something like that."
I:8380;1451;"But the best part of the movie was at the end when the girls give her an award and she said,"" I really want world peace."""
I:8380;1452;This movie is for fans of Sandra or not but it's a good movie.
I:8380;1453;So I love this movie and I think everyone needs to watch it once you just might fall in love with this movie.
I:8380;1454;If not that's okay but it's just the best of movie that I think the women did for her caree.
I:8380;1455;Sandra Bullock is a great comedic actress.
I:8380;1456;I love this funny and heartwarming movie.
I:8380;1457;It was fun to see it again.
I:8380;1458;Though it has one of those simple plots that must take about ten seconds to pitch, winning performances from just about everybody elevate this flick.
I:8380;1459;The script is actually paradoxical on this point .
I:8380;1460;With the help of a disgraced pageant coach (Michael Caine) and a crew of top.
I:8380;1461;, Grace Hart is transformed into the glam Gracie Lou Freebush.
I:8380;1462;hill MC, the man who can smile through anything, and Ben Bratt as Bullock's chauvanist partner.
I:8380;1463;This was an idea done to death decades ago on countless network shows (Bionic Woman, Wonder Woman, Charlie's Angels) but it works here.
I:8380;1464;I watch this movie all the time.
I:8380;1465;It's funny and pretty safe for most people.
I:8380;1466;Although I have more respect for my battered Strats than I do for Hollywood stars, I, like most decent human beings, am moved by your profoundly generous gesture in the wake of the staggering Asian tsunami tragedy.
I:8380;1467;from now on, I'm going to make an extra effort to appreciate your work, especially this swell comedy which reflects your fabulous personality more truly than you could possibly know.
I:8380;1468;This is an older movie, but it's a cute comedy.
I:8380;1469;It's great on day when you need to just watch something mindless.
I:8380;1470;This was a gift for my brother who has a thing for Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;1471;I enjoyed the movie myself, and reviews I read prior to ordering were favorable.
I:8380;1472;The movie arrived in good time and in good condition.
I:8380;1473;Very enjoyable movie causing me to laugh out loud several times.
I:8380;1474;Sandra Bullock is perfect as the gungho FBI agent and the gorgeous contestant .
I:8380;1475;Sandra Bullock is one of the few gorgeous actresses I've seen who can pull off the homely girl next door look.
I:8380;1476;the rest of the cast is excellent, too.
I:8380;1477;Michael Caine, Benjamin Bratt, Candice Bergen, and William Shatner all do wonderful jobs with their roles.
I:8380;1478;You also get to know the beauty contestants and (gasp!)
I:8380;1479;this is a great feel.
I:8380;1480;If laughter is the best medicine, this movie is good for you!
I:8380;1481;This is one of those kind of movies that you want to sit back and enjoy.
I:8380;1482;Very light movie with a good story.
I:8380;1483;Sandra Bullock's acting is as always very good.
I:8380;1484;It has finally been done!
I:8380;1485;This movie has enough action and adventure to keep the males happy, and enough of a plot, and deep enough characters to keep women happy.
I:8380;1486;When they are busy on character development, the men are distracted by the great array of beautiful women on the screen that they won't notice that the movie has a plot.
I:8380;1487;michael Caine is absolutely hysterical as a Henry Higgin sort of fellow.
I:8380;1488;He does such a splendid job, and is horrified at what he must accomplish, and with what.
I:8380;1489;Sandra Bullock did a good job in a comedy.
I:8380;1490;"It was fun to watch
I:8380;1491;She is always so believable in her roles and brings a natural sass she can't hide.
I:8380;1492;Cute chick flick with comedy and romance and enough to keep your guy entertained for a cuddly movie night !!
I:8380;1493;It was kind of funny, but I expected better from her.
I:8380;1494;Sandra Bullock starred in many excellent movies like 28 days,practical magic and hope floats which made her famous.
I:8380;1495;Sandra Bullock played a piggish type FBI agent that has to go undercover for a beauty pagent.
I:8380;1496;I never laughed during this movie.
I:8380;1497;While I love most Sandra Bullock movies, this is one of my favorites!
I:8380;1498;Great humor and lovable characters.
I:8380;1499;I especially love that they play into some stereotypes while breaking out of others.
I:8380;1500;Sandar Bullock is a fantastic actress.
I:8380;1501;I can see why they rated it PG.13 (a few references, some foul language, some violence), but for the most part it's really just a fun movie
I:8380;1502;It's a very entertaining comedy.
I:8380;1503;It would even be OK for the whole family to watch.
I:8380;1504;FBI agent Gracie Hart (played by the fantastic Sandra Bullock) is a real tomboy.
I:8380;1505;"She becomes Miss New Jersey, the FBI finding out and ready to expose the original winner because of her appearance in an ""adult film""."
I:8380;1506;"Miraculously, Victor accomplishes his task, muttering to himself, ""My God, I'm good!"""
I:8380;1507;the cast of 'Miss Congeniality' is what makes the movie such a success.
I:8380;1508;Bullock and Caine work well together, each delivering superb performances.
I:8380;1509;The humor is light and frequent, so the show keeps you laughing all the way through.
I:8380;1510;This is one of my favorite comedies, being a hardcore Sandra Bullock fan.
I:8380;1511;This is a hilariously funny movie with a sweet touch of innocence, yet it manages not to become saccharine.
I:8380;1512;Gracie is a piece of work.
I:8380;1513;As far from a Beauty Pageant contestant as any woman can be, or is she?My Opinion: A fun movie, but it completely lacks any depth what so ever.
I:8380;1514;I loved Shrek and Spy Kids both of which did a great job balancing silliness with a great story and some serious points (serious being a relative term here).
I:8380;1515;This film always makes me laugh.
I:8380;1516;The transformation Sandra goes through both physically and mentally is amazing and she is very believable in both characterizations!
I:8380;1517;The cast is excellent .
I:8380;1518;A great film to watch time and time again.
I:8380;1519;well, a hot babe cop going undercover in a beauty pageant.
I:8380;1520;Kudos to Bullock's makeup assistant as he is the hardest working man in show business insuring that she stays hot so her audiences keep coming so they can instant message and chew bubblegum all the way through.
I:8380;1521;With Melling's help, Gracie manages to beautify herself and learn to compete, thus proving to herself and others, she 'has what it takes' to be Miss America.
I:8380;1522;i found Miss Congeniality to be a entertaining, funny light drama, despite its obvious message: You must be beautiful to be someone.
I:8380;1523;Despite this obvious misogynistic overtones, I really did liked this flick.
I:8380;1524;Bullock did a great job of portraying Gracie in both the 'before and after' phases and it was fun to see William Shatner co. star as the contestant host.
I:8380;1525;if you don't read too much into this movie, it was pleasantly entertaining, flick, perfect to watch on a rainy day.
I:8380;1526;I like this movie and not for the beautiful and amazing Sandra Bullock,but it was a fun and feel good movie!!!!!
I:8380;1527;The actors were amazing and it was nice to see William Shatner be in a funny movie rather then seeing him in his old days when he was on Star Trek the series!!!!!!!
I:8380;1528;I do recommend seeing this funny movie and trust me it will make you feel good too!!!!
I:8380;1529;This is one of the best clean comedies of all time!
I:8380;1530;Sandra Bullock is amazing in this movie!
I:8380;1531;love itand the best of all free with prime!!!
I:8380;1532;this movie is always on my top, as my favorite movies.
I:8380;1533;I thought this film was hilarious!
I:8380;1534;The lead characters play their roles convincingly, and the plot is solid and funny.
I:8380;1535;miss Congeniality is a comedy that loves to make fun of itsself.
I:8380;1536;It mixes satire with light and dark comedy perfectly!
I:8380;1537;Very cheesy and predictable, but entertaining nonetheless.
I:8380;1538;Ending easy to guess but it was a fun movie to watch, recommended.
I:8380;1539;Sandra Bullock is a brilliant actor.
I:8380;1540;This is a hilarious spoof on beauty pageants.
I:8380;1541;This movie was an easy movie to watch.
I:8380;1542;Sandra Bullock does a wonderful job portraying the FBI agent stuck with the job of being a contestant at the Miss America beauty pageant.
I:8380;1543;She is funny and charming as she is introduced into the world of womanhood that she tries to avoid with all her might.
I:8380;1544;even when she tries to look bad, she looks beautiful!
I:8380;1545;LOL A fine, funny film .
I:8380;1546;I so enjoyed this movie.
I:8380;1547;True, I do really adore most of Sandra Bullock's work but this one made me laugh right out loud continuosly.
I:8380;1548;I actually believe it is her best effort at comedy thus far.
I:8380;1549;I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did!
I:8380;1550;This is a perfect movie for a girls sleepover or to watch with the family.
I:8380;1551;It's mostly clean and a lot of fun.
I:8380;1552;I didn't have very high hopes for this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.
I:8380;1553;It was entertaining, funny and at the same time touching.
I:8380;1554;Sandra B is just darling and funny.
I:8380;1555;This is classic for all friends of the light hearted and funny movies starring Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;1556;If you are a Sandra Bullock fan you are going to love her in Miss Congeniality.
I:8380;1557;Bullock shines in some of her best work as the FBI agent gone undercover as a beauty pageant contestant.
I:8380;1558;The suppporting cast is also great, led by William Shatner who makes you laugh out loud with his portrayal of the dumb.
I:8380;1559;Lot's of laughs and good, clean, family fun!
I:8380;1560;I'm going to watch the sequel as well because I really enjoyed this movie.
I:8380;1561;I thought it was really funny.
I:8380;1562;Well directed and edited, good acting.
I:8380;1563;Overall fun to watch, you will not go wrong, will enjoy
I:8380;1564;Sandra is one of the most attractive woman in the Hollywood not just because she is a beautiful woman but also because her radiant personality and this lovely sparkles in her eyes.
I:8380;1565;This is my favorite movie starring Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;1566;She has to actually do girlie things.
I:8380;1567;The scene where Eric (the handsome Benjamin Bratt) has to convince Gracie she is perfect for the assignment, and they fight is hilarious!!!
I:8380;1568;He changes his mind and gives it a go.
I:8380;1569;He brings in a team that would make Extreme Make over look like play time.
I:8380;1570;Gracie is transformed from an ugly duckling to a beautiful swan.
I:8380;1571;Sanda Bullock is so beautiful, but she plays frumpy quite well.
I:8380;1572;Another really funny moment was how she ate the steak.
I:8380;1573;I laughed, but cringed at the same time.
I:8380;1574;She would eat and talk.
I:8380;1575;When Gracie is surrounded by her fellow contestants that's when the fun really starts.
I:8380;1576;the reason this movie is so funny is it has a slapstick appeal.
I:8380;1577;the other female contestants in the movie were also funny.
I:8380;1578;Gracie's jumping off stage to tackle a guy with a gun is hilarious.
I:8380;1579;The romance between Gracie and Eric was really cute.
I:8380;1580;This is a must watch movie for sure.
I:8380;1581;One of my favorites that I love to watch over, and over again.
I:8380;1582;"Always funny, stands the test of time
I:8380;1583;A family movie you can enjoy without foul language and explicit sexual content!

I:8380;1591;Definitely something you can watch with your family.
I:8380;1592;I would recommend to others.
I:8380;1593;Awesome and awesome and awesome and really amazingly awesome.
I:8380;1594;I cant even describe it.
I:8380;1595;I must have seen this movie a hundred times and I still love it :) Sweet, funny, and loveable.
I:8380;1596;Sandra Bullock is a great actress, either in comedy or drama
I:8380;1597;It oozes suphistocation, sassy, sex appeal and great comedie!
I:8380;1598;Sandra Bullock totally fitted this part to a T.
I:8380;1599;It proves that beauty can be found in everyone :.)
I:8380;1600;Sandra Bullock portrayes a strong female character who kicks ass and looks good doing it :.)
I:8380;1601;I recomend this movie to peeps of all ages!
I:8380;1602;This film has got to be one of Sandra's best films to date.
I:8380;1603;This film is very funny and full of gags all the way from showing that Sandra is an excellent actress and can adapt to all roles
I:8380;1604;good for a laugh .
I:8380;1605;Sandar Bullock is a good actress .
I:8380;1606;If you like Sandra you will like this movie.
I:8380;1607;Just sit back, eat some popcorn, and have a good evening with a good movie.
I:8380;1608;Awesome classic that all people should see.
I:8380;1609;Brought back a lot of good memories.
I:8380;1610;But in the middle of the story, she brings her only love.
I:8380;1611;In order to even accept this scene as mildly humorous you have to believe that violent sexual abuse is cute and funny.
I:8380;1612;This is a really funny movie.
I:8380;1613;"Sandra Bullock plays a ""Cinderella"" FBI agent and is perfect for the role."
I:8380;1614;"The supporting cast are ""over the top"" but that just adds to the enjoyment."
I:8380;1615;Shakespeare it's not, but entertaining it is.
I:8380;1616;The plot was a little imaginative but it was well thought out and the acting was good.
I:8380;1617;would recommend this movie to all.

I:8380;1625;This movie is an old classic and I enjoy it every time I watch!
I:8380;1626;I love this girl power film!
I:8380;1627;I think that I was able to tolerate her sweet nature in this film due to her part.
I:8380;1628;She played someone that I could see her as in real life and that is what changed it all for me.
I:8380;1629;The storyline was great and the characters were well developed.
I:8380;1630;Everyone in this film did a great job in performing their parts.
I:8380;1631;Michael was superb as the person called in to change over Sandra's rough character, so that she could be in the pagaent.
I:8380;1632;A fun film that will please over again and again.
I:8380;1633;A great Chick Flick, but guys won't like it at all!

I:8380;1639;I think this movie is great.
I:8380;1640;She is a great actor.
I:8380;1641;I watch a lot of her movies.
I:8380;1642;The movie is full of gags and will keep you laughing the whole time.
I:8380;1643;Best of all, the humor isn't dirty or gross, a welcome change after the Austin Powers type movies that seem to be dominate lately.
I:8380;1644;It's funny, not gross, and things even blow up.
I:8380;1645;This is a great cast and although the story is shallow they bring it off in great style.
I:8380;1646;I watch it when I want a good laugh and a movie with a snappy pace.
I:8380;1647;It was entertaining and funny.
I:8380;1648;They did a good job with the transformation of Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;1649;Although it lacked the depth and plot build up, I still laughed on many occasions and it kept in the movie to the end.
I:8380;1650;Our family really enjoyed this movie.
I:8380;1651;old son put up a good fight against watching it, but I think he enjoyedit the most.
I:8380;1652;:)I love anything with Sandra Bullock in it!
I:8380;1653;It is a cute film and I'm glad we own a copy.
I:8380;1654;Would they ever be able to clean her up in time to make her a believable top 10 contestant?
I:8380;1655;Whether you love 'em or hate 'em, beauty pageants are an American cultural phenomena .
I:8380;1656;It has a following, some people take it very seriously, and some people mock it.
I:8380;1657;The genius of the film is in the absolutely hilarious timing and ironic circumstances.
I:8380;1658;The riotous finale had me in tears, it was so funny.
I:8380;1659;additionally, the casting was excellent.
I:8380;1660;consultant who works miracles with the incorrigible Gracie .
I:8380;1661;I absolutely loved this movie!!!!!!!
I:8380;1662;Sandra Bullock is the best candidate for Gracie Hart.
I:8380;1663;Sandra Bullock fit the role perfectly.
I:8380;1664;up people did a great job in presenting her in the role.
I:8380;1665;It was lot's of fun to watch.
I:8380;1666;Okay, I admit, I laughed out loud watching this surprisingly good movie.
I:8380;1667;Dumb jokes for sure, but still very funny.
I:8380;1668;rated and over her head as a star.
I:8380;1669;Sandra was great in it.
I:8380;1670;Sandra Bullock played her part well.
I:8380;1671;Sandra Bullock has always been my favorite actress.
I:8380;1672;She is very cute and funny.
I:8380;1673;After a string of dramatic, deep, and comedy.
I:8380;1674;The cast, combined with the witty premise, and Sandra Bullock's brilliant Acting and Producing ability, makes Miss Congeniality one of the best films Sandra Bullock has ever pulled off.
I:8380;1675;The movie was very entertaining, even for my kids.
I:8380;1676;The script was very kid friendly, but also kept it interesting and funny enough for the adults.
I:8380;1677;A very enjoyable movie with Sandra Bullock who had a change of life style.
I:8380;1678;Michael Caine was great as her Coach.
I:8380;1679;Candice Bergen was fun as the counterpoint to Bullock's character.
I:8380;1680;William Shatner was a welcome surprise in the movie.
I:8380;1681;If you are looking for a light movie that is funny.
I:8380;1682;this is a good one.
I:8380;1683;It is also appropriate for most in the family.
I:8380;1684;I laughed lots and that was worth the money to replace a broken disc.
I:8380;1685;Sandra Bullock is perfect for this role and while the premise sounds a little lame before you see the movie after seeing it I think anyone will be pleasantly surprised.
I:8380;1686;If you are expecting an Oscar style movie.
I:8380;1687;This movie is totally delightful and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:8380;1688;It is funny, light, laughable.
I:8380;1689;I loved it and I think anyone else will too if you allow yourself to jsut be entertained.
I:8380;1690;Bullock is so funny and so great at this type of movie and she learns allot about herself throughout the film so there is character growth too.
I:8380;1691;It will also give you a new appreciation for what the women in beauty pageants put themselves through.
I:8380;1692;Sandra Bullock was perfect for the part.
I:8380;1693;The ending was good and the acting was great.
I:8380;1694;A better movie than I expected.
I:8380;1695;i will share share this with other people because they going to love it like i did.
I:8380;1696;I can watch it over and over again and laugh each and every time!!
I:8380;1697;Her timing is fantastic and she looks great with Benjamin Bratt.
I:8380;1698;Michael Cain is so funny it kills me each time I watch it.
I:8380;1699;I hope they do a part two for this one.
I:8380;1700;I would go see it on opening day!
I:8380;1701;And this is my all time favorite movie of hers.
I:8380;1702;Her personality just makes this movie.
I:8380;1703;I love Sandra Bullock, she is so entertaining and funny.
I:8380;1704;Very entertaining movie, fun to watch.
I:8380;1705;This is a great family movie and has lots of laughs.
I:8380;1706;This movie has a good story, cute and hillarious parts, good actors, and.
I:8380;1707;well, everything seems to come together.
I:8380;1708;this is a terrific movie.
I:8380;1709;This was a hilarious film!
I:8380;1710;I thought this was a fun movie to watch.
I:8380;1711;It didn't have a whole lot of depth but I certainly enjoyed watching it.
I:8380;1712;she needs a fast job of coaching and preparation so that she will be able to pull off the job of a beauty contestant as she is absolutely unsuited for it.
I:8380;1713;He is the coach and mentor and he is spectacular!
I:8380;1714;I thought that Julia and Michael were superb in their parts.
I:8380;1715;if you want a good light.
I:8380;1716;hearted comedy to entertain you, then this movie should fit the bill.
I:8380;1717;As we were thinking that she might be living a gloomy acting life, she surprised us and rocked us with this hilarious and witty Miss Congeniality!The story was a very basic and sometimes headless one, but it managed to incorporate stuff that were important to make the storyline move on tightly and in an interesting manner.
I:8380;1718;The cast was very good, this not only applied to Sandra, Michael and Benjamin, but also to all the girls in the pageant or the scholarship program as it was put in the movie.
I:8380;1719;Sandra Bullock tried hard to destroy her image of the girl next door and it was very successful.
I:8380;1720;But watching a well imaged and dressed up Sandra behaving like a man was even funnier.
I:8380;1721;michael Caine was as usual good.
I:8380;1722;He was the next most important character in the movie and you can see that he really played his role with the exact amount of precision.
I:8380;1723;They are fabulous and they are really the spice of the dish.
I:8380;1724;in all, if you are looking for a funny movie that you could watch again and again and still have a good laugh, Miss Congeniality is a very good choice.
I:8380;1725;One of my favorite Sandra Bullock movies.
I:8380;1726;Sandra Bullock is a very charming, charismatic, engaging actress.
I:8380;1727;She's got that very special something which makes you instantly like her.
I:8380;1728;co. produced by Sandra Bullock, this film certainly has its moments.
I:8380;1729;along for the ride are a very funny Michael Caine as a pagent consultant and a perfectly wonderful Candice Bergen.
I:8380;1730;They both are talented comedic actors.
I:8380;1731;It's got some genuine laughs, but they just don't come frequent enough for this to be a real laugh.
I:8380;1732;This commentary is funnier than the entire movie.
I:8380;1733;It truly shows off the sense of humor that Sandra Bullock has.
I:8380;1734;This movie's pretty bad and all, but every once in a while, someone will say or do something that's really funny.
I:8380;1735;And while most people are driven to the brink of insanity by William Shatner's singing, I find it amusing.
I:8380;1736;The title to this film fits Sandra Bullock perfectly in more ways than one.
I:8380;1737;Anyway, the movie is a great showcase for Bullock's comedic talents.
I:8380;1738;Caine steals every scene he is in and Shatner should have done more comedy in his career because he's so funny.
I:8380;1739;overall, not too bad of a movie that is enjoyable to watch because of Bullock, Caine, and Shatner.
I:8380;1740;i got this as a gift for my mom she loved this movie because its so funny.
I:8380;1741;it has 3 deleted scenes and a fun quiz fan of the movie will love
I:8380;1742;Sandra Bullock's movies are always the best.
I:8380;1743;She is a great actress!
I:8380;1744;Always fun to watch even though it is pretty old.
I:8380;1745;Sandra Bullock does a great job of the tomboy gone glam.
I:8380;1746;I recommend it to all of my friends!
I:8380;1747;Miss Congeniality is such a cute movie starring Sandra Bullock.
I:8380;1748;It is definitely a movie made for Sandra, and she does a wonderful job in her role which is a typical Sandra Bullock movie.
I:8380;1749;I have always enjoyed her movies.
I:8380;1750;I really enjoyed this film.
I:8380;1751;It will leave you smiling for the rest of the day.
I:8380;1752;Sandra Bullock is a very talented actress,I like all the movies with her.
I:8380;1753;it is so funny and entertaining!
I:8380;1754;the chemistry between her and The other actors was so natural.
I:8380;1755;I recommend this movie for all age groups.
I:8380;1756;I like Sandra Bullock's works in general.
I:8380;1757;I have found her characters likeable and watchable, and I haven't felt intellectually insulted by her movies (though I haven't seen Speed).
I:8380;1758;For this movie to be a gem the actors needed to be more convincing as FBI agents.
I:8380;1759;it was a good decision to make the Pageant contestents privately smart and with their own sense of honor.
I:8380;1760;william Shatner delivered a great camp.
I:8380;1761;performance, which is a compliment because that's what he was tasked to do.
I:8380;1762;so this film is clearly camp and that is the two edge sword, since it's clearly not camp.
I:8380;1763;however, I found the film to be an enjoyable ha.
I:8380;1764;enjoyable movie and you will all be ok.
I:8380;1765;Everyone acted their role quite well.
I:8380;1766;I v always liked her screen presence and this movie has all the moves.
I:8380;1767;Enjoyable script with witty dialog and an outstanding performance by Sandra Bullock makes what would otherwise be a dead.
I:8380;1768;water predictable comedy into a genuinely enjoyable film.
I:8380;1769;I've actually seen it before and decided to watch it again because I knew it would be light and funny and that was what I wanted!
I:8380;1770;hearted Sandra Bullock flick, has proven to be one of the funniest movies ever produced.
I:8380;1771;I personally saw it 5 times in theaters because I enjoyed it so much, and I noticed each time that there was a wide range of audience (from ages 5.75, and both sexes).
I:8380;1772;It is definitely NOT a chick flick.
I:8380;1773;"** From the lyrics to Tom Jones' hit song ""She's a Lady"" (played over the closing credits):Well, she's all you'll ever wantShe's the kind I'd like to flauntAnd take to deener."
I:8380;1774;well she always knows her placeShe's got style, she's got graceShe's a wiener!I put off watching this movie for a long time, as I generally don't laugh at the comedies Hollywood produces these days.
I:8380;1775;bullock is charming, as is the entire supporting cast .
I:8380;1776;all in all, a very enjoyable way to spend an evening.
I:8380;1777;Congratulations to everyone involved in making a light and fun piece of entertainment.
I:8380;1778;Miss Congeniality is a real wiener!

I:8380;1783;Truly mature viewers will find it thought.
I:8380;1784;Is life really a beauty pageant, are we all like Sandra Bullock, and how much does a nice gown contribute to self.
I:8380;1785;These are the kinds of important questions addressed here, with style and aplombe galore.
I:8380;1786;Sandra is the best actress in the business, I love her in all movies.
I:8380;1787;The plot was great for her and gives a brightness to the art.
