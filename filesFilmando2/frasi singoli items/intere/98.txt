I:1982;1;This is one of the best and truest comic book to movie adaptations ever.
I:1982;2;Robert Downey is absolutely perfect as Tony Stark, and the supporting cast was all on the money as well.
I:1982;3;I have to say I enjoyed them much more in my home theatre than in the movie theatre.
I:1982;4;I feel the fan boy coming back and I love it.
I:1982;5;finding the enemy is well armedBy weaponry he never meant to have harmedOur own side by enemy forcesTrickling in by unknown sources.
I:1982;6;with a humanitarian touch, not based on moneyAnd Pepper Pots, his helper, proves to be a real honey,They face a greedy nemesis found in Stane,Board.
I:1982;7;directors' man keeping investors sane.
I:1982;8;(The snappy dialogue and the awesome flying shots go well with the funny, slapstick test flight scenes from Tony Stark's Malibu laboratory.
I:1982;9;"Gwyneth Paltrow is alluring and likable as his caring, but witty assistant, Pepper, and Jeff Bridges makes a welcome return as ""Oby"" Stane."
I:1982;10;Terrence Howard is believable as gung ho Colonel Rhodes.
I:1982;11;I'm usualy pretty pick when it comes to movies but I was unexpectedly impressed with this movie.
I:1982;12;It's an action packed movied with a good story line.
I:1982;13;Great movie to watch with buddies, family, etc.
I:1982;14;great movie but you can't watch it unless you own a kindle fire!i cant use it for anything not my Ipod, or the crapy ultraviolet.
I:1982;15;It is the best way to save money, and I have always got EXACTLY what I ordered UNTIL NOW!
I:1982;16;The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over.40 to be a superhero.
I:1982;17;I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene.
I:1982;18;I watched this movie because my BF is a huge marvel comics fan and had seen all the marvel movies and was tired of explaining all the avengers to me.
I:1982;19;i actually really enjoyed this movie and Downey, Jr was perfect in this role.
I:1982;20;So funny and really brought this character to life.
I:1982;21;For a chick who normally doesn't like action (bang, bang shoot em up) movies, I thoroughly enjoyed Iron Man.
I:1982;22;I am a fan of Marvel Comics and this is just another enjoyable movie within the franchise.
I:1982;23;"delivered on time
I:1982;24;He holds it on his shoulders ably.
I:1982;25;the only question : Is the movie entertaining .
I:1982;26;yes it is, in fact is for that reason that I give it 5 stars.
I:1982;27;this movie is a master class in acting from Robert .
I:1982;28;of course the supporting cast are right there with him .
I:1982;29;the last line of the film is delivered perfectly by Robert and leads in to the next movie.
I:1982;30;the last line is perfect because everything previous to it leads there logically .
I:1982;31;perhaps one day we will see a Director's Cut of this, though I won't be surprised if we don't, as it is perfect.
I:1982;32;If you liked Robocop, you definitely love IRONMAN.
I:1982;33;but at the same time, this movie tells the story of a few things that are true and going as we breathe.
I:1982;34;also, this movie proves to me that the government(certain politicians and leaders) is good at only one thing.
I:1982;35;covering up lies, cheating, killing, stealing, and manipulating.
I:1982;36;"This might be more of a ""guy's movie"" but I'm a female and I loved it."
I:1982;37;Although the sets are sometimes a bit contrived (especially the Afghanistan parts), you just want to believe in this guy and it's easy to overlook them.
I:1982;38;If you like science, dry humor and superheroes, you will want to watch this movie!
I:1982;39;The movie is great, but the customer service was not.
I:1982;40;Movie came as described in a timely fashion.
I:1982;41;This was definitely a good movie.
I:1982;42;it is suitable for all ages, though some little kids would likely get scared.
I:1982;43;Basically I absolutely love Marvel, and my friend absolutely loves Robert Downey Jr's character of Iron Man.
I:1982;44;And he wanted to help people, which is always a good sign.Yes, Tony Stark was played by Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;45;Robert did an awesome job at portraying Tony.
I:1982;46;It was really incredible, what made the movie so great.
I:1982;47;"Yes, it was the director
I:1982;48;Congratulations, Robert!All in all, Iron Man was a fantastic movie.
I:1982;49;But Iron Man is definitely worth watching at least once.
I:1982;50;Loved the visual effects, the idea of story, and the fact that there is a sequel!!
I:1982;51;Iron Man is the biggest disappoinment so far this year.
I:1982;52;This is one action film I won't be seeing twice, yuck!
I:1982;53;Everything from acting to graphics to the story is wonderful.
I:1982;54;I have been very happy overall with Amazon.
I:1982;55;The 2 disk edition is good, but I think if your going to picture what your selling.
I:1982;56;The disks are great, and I made my own sleeve cover, that depicts the original cover shown on the Amazon page.
I:1982;57;"provoking
I:1982;58;With superb special effects, amazing gadgets, and stunning visual effects .
I:1982;59;It is very subtle but it is there.
I:1982;60;"In the pursuit of perfection as viewed in ""The Making of"", the personalities of the characters got nixed."
I:1982;61;Even thought it contains violence, it was an action packed movie where goodness prevails.
I:1982;62;On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better.
I:1982;63;I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better.
I:1982;64;Instead he builds his Iron Man suit.
I:1982;65;Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job.
I:1982;66;The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies.
I:1982;67;The plot has its share of intriguing twists.
I:1982;68;I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion.
I:1982;69;I rate this movie 10/10.
I:1982;70;I'm a Batman girl myself, but if they continue to make Iron Man films as good as this one then I'll become a fan.
I:1982;71;robert Downey Jr. does a really good job in this film.
I:1982;72;His ability to make the one liners snap really works, and I was laughing at plenty of them.
I:1982;73;He was also really convincing as a genuis billionare weapons manufacturer.
I:1982;74;He almost made it look like a really cool and fun job.
I:1982;75;But instead of doing that he invents a suit that turns out to be an awesome piece of technology.
I:1982;76;the special effects are really cool in this movie.
I:1982;77;the movie flows along at a pretty good pace.
I:1982;78;the entire cast I felt was really good in this.
I:1982;79;The action was perfect, the imaginative weapons and gadgets on the suit were hot.
I:1982;80;my family loves all the Iron Man movies.
I:1982;81;this movie has great action and it is fun to watch.
I:1982;82;let's face it, how can one seriously knock a film that is based on a comic book character?
I:1982;83;"rich defense contractor Tony Stark, played very nicely by Robert Downey, Jr., just happens to have had a ""conversion"" experience in of all places, modern day Afghanistan (if one can accept that as a correct term in that benighted country) as a result of a very close call with the results of his own weaponry at the hands of a Taliban."
I:1982;84;fashioned chaste romance with his fair damsel, oops, Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and you have the makings of a very good.
I:1982;85;The comic books, and their very appealing characters, are of no use for use on that proposition though.
I:1982;86;robert Downey, Jr. is an incredible actor and never disappoints.
I:1982;87;This is a very good movie and the packaging is very sharp.
I:1982;88;If you like any of the Marvel Comics Movies I recommend that you see them all.
I:1982;89;The movie came quickly, and was an amazing price because of the lightning deal.
I:1982;90;The timing of shipping and delivery was good.
I:1982;91;So I got it and watched it yesterday and was pleasantly suprised!
I:1982;92;It was action packed, funny, and even had a little love story weaved throughout!
I:1982;93;Plus if you are a Robert Downey Jr fan this movie is for you
I:1982;94;it came in great condition and received it on time.
I:1982;95;Fun story with a good plot and.
I:1982;96;Good first part of the trilogy.
I:1982;97;I really enjoyed iron man!
I:1982;98;He fashions himself a new and improved armored suit, with all the trimmings, bells and whistles, plus the obligatory arc reactor which is the heart of the design9.
I:1982;99;"Two sequels are plannedThe movie takes a while to get to the really cool stuff, and while I enjoyed the whole thing, my son didn't get into it until ""suit time."""
I:1982;100;Highly entertaining and energetic film.
I:1982;101;Acting by Robert Downey, Jr. is great.
I:1982;102;Other actors, including Gwyneth Paltrow, are terrific.
I:1982;103;The story and special effects are wonderfully blended to add excitement and entertainment in a film that becomes memorable and requires frequent viewings.
I:1982;104;It has great acting and a fantastic plot.
I:1982;105;I enjoy the humor in this movie.
I:1982;106;I'm a huge fan of all of the Iron Man movies.
I:1982;107;This is one of the few movies I've seen in theaters in recent years.
I:1982;108;I was entertained and impressed by the level of story, bringing back much of the joy of the Iron Man comic books I read when young.
I:1982;109;"The action and CGI use wasn't merely there because they could do it
I:1982;110;Great for family movie nights.
I:1982;111;Well known actors and entertaining story line.
I:1982;112;otherwise, downey is awesome, the dialog is fun, etc.
I:1982;113;I love Robert Downey Jr., he is fantastic as Iron Man!
I:1982;114;Great action filled movie for the family to watch.
I:1982;115;The grandkids really loved it.
I:1982;116;Husband and grandkids watch it all the time.
I:1982;117;I thought it was enjoyable and look forward to wathcing Iron Man II.
I:1982;118;LOL Great movie looks great on my new TV and is fun!
I:1982;119;It's still fun watching it for a second time (and knowing what will happen).
I:1982;120;Gave this as a gift, the recipient was impressed!
I:1982;121;tRULY hope they don't dissappoint!
I:1982;122;kindle the comic book market for this hero as well.
I:1982;123;Instead they went all out with a rock solid plot that is real, gritty, and believable.
I:1982;124;the casting was right on and the actors did a great job bringing the characters to life.
I:1982;125;Downey just nails the part in every way.
I:1982;126;I have never been a fan of his actually as he has always irritated me but he has redeemed himself in Iron Man and I totally rooted for his character.
I:1982;127;Everyone else from major parts to even the smaller parts did a wonderful job.
I:1982;128;the art work and effects were also just amazing.
I:1982;129;The attention to detail just blows my mind.
I:1982;130;The suit in particular and how he puts it on made perfect sense and it was great to share the joy of his discoveries with Iron Man.
I:1982;131;"The level of detail on the suit in particular just made me constantly say ""WOW'."
I:1982;132;in the end I highly recommend this movie to anyone as it is one of my favorite movies now.
I:1982;133;The whole family loves this movie.
I:1982;134;but this movie is very well made.
I:1982;135;He brings a sense of humor to a character that I did not think had a sense of humor.
I:1982;136;Unlike other films of these gender the producers tried to make this a believable film like the Japanese Summari Movies.
I:1982;137;Robert Downey Jr. is excellently sarcastic and hilarious in such a nonchalant way.
I:1982;138;The humor is excellently timed and the special effects are fantastic.
I:1982;139;And, unlike some superhero films, the plot is marvelous.
I:1982;140;ray is the perfect way to experience the film.
I:1982;141;Got a great price too!
I:1982;142;Great movie to own on Blu.
I:1982;143;There is some graininess to the picture, but it is still sharp, clear, colorful, and vivid.
I:1982;144;"*Includes a vast number of great special features
I:1982;145;*Smashing special effects and action scenes.
I:1982;146;A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth.
I:1982;147;*Very good, sleek production designs and costumes.
I:1982;148;Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance.
I:1982;149;*Good themes and imagery reflecting modern.
I:1982;150;"day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to ""Lord of War"", but not as serious)."
I:1982;151;"*Pretty good characters
I:1982;152;In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be.
I:1982;153;once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie.
I:1982;154;Much of the action and effects are quite memorable.
I:1982;155;The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening.
I:1982;156;Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern.
I:1982;157;"It is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than ""The Fantastic Four."""
I:1982;158;It was great to see the movie that started the Avengers franchise off so well!
I:1982;159;enjoy, kids will want to see this more than once to get all the action.
I:1982;160;My whole family loved the movie.
I:1982;161;He is enjoying as we speak.

I:1982;165;This action all takes place in the first few minutes of the film.
I:1982;166;The Tony Stark character has many complex qualities.
I:1982;167;He is intelligent, quirky, egocentric, stubborn, charming, funny and spoiled.
I:1982;168;More importantly, Downey's comedic talents keep the film fun and fresh.
I:1982;169;The supporting cast, including Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow, also turn in strong performances.
I:1982;170;The way Jon Favreau captures the action is stronger still.
I:1982;171;Combat sequences have an intensity and realism that bring the story to life and pay off the plot.
I:1982;172;The special effects are top notch.
I:1982;173;Motion and flight are captured very well.

I:1982;175;Audiences were thrilled with the film's original film release and they will be thrilled again with this awesome Blu.
I:1982;176;ray is far cleaner and clearer and definitely nearly noise.
I:1982;177;It's just that an incredible amount of material is assigned to the subwoofer, which effectively shook the room.
I:1982;178;The audio engineering is overall excellent, with live action appearing wide and powerful while noises coming from the plasma screens in Tony's home, for example, sounded narrow and constricted.
I:1982;179;It was an interesting mix and one that works very well with the film's style.
I:1982;180;ray Special Features and Extras:Blu.
I:1982;181;disc package available on Blu.
I:1982;182;Robert Downey, Jr. and the special effects give Iron Man a fresh, unique vibe that sets it apart from most action or superhero films.
I:1982;183;"There are enough surprises and plot twists to keep any audience on their toes
I:1982;184;Iron Man gets my highest recommendation and Paramount, a studio that not long ago snubbed Blu.
I:1982;185;ray consumers, gets my thumbs up on a job very well done.
I:1982;186;ray releases and now I am totally delighted with what I now own in my Blu.
I:1982;187;ray Collection and if you like totally action packed films with a hint of comedy, then you will not go wrong in owning this amazing Marvel Comic Action Hero.
I:1982;188;It was full of action, good story, funny, and I really enjoyed it.
I:1982;189;I'm 11yr old, and liked Ironman better than Man of Steel
I:1982;190;From the moment that `Iron Man' began I knew that this was going to be a fun ride.
I:1982;191;While `Iron Man' may lack the moral dilemmas that made `The Dark Knight' one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, it definitely earns a spot next to `Spider.
I:1982;192;man 2' as one of the most exciting and most watchable superhero movies in recent memory.
I:1982;193;"He was funny, he was touching, he was bold, he was confident, he was vulnerable, he was angry
I:1982;194;Instead, he builds himself a supersuit that enables him to escape with his life.
I:1982;195;After witnessing the atrocities that his company has helped create (he builds weapons for war) he decides that he doesn't want his legacy to be mere death but he wants to do something meaningful with his life.
I:1982;196;His decision to stop making weapons comes as a blow to the company and to his partner, Obadiah Stane, and it places him on a rocky path with his friend Rhodey, so Stark finds himself secluded and alone as he attempts to create something huge from his very noble idea.
I:1982;197;the performances here are all wonderful, each and every one.
I:1982;198;Downey Jr. owns this movie (this was such a great year for him) but he is helped along by a wonderfully talented cast.
I:1982;199;This man is gold to me, and here he is just brilliant.
I:1982;200;Not only is he dashing in every scene (I really want his wardrobe) but he is also engaging and intriguing (and he has the best character arc).
I:1982;201;Gwyneth Paltrow is luminous here as well.
I:1982;202;She has received lots of good press for this performance, and rightfully so.
I:1982;203;She is the typical conflicted best girl to the hero, but she plays it with such fresh spunk.
I:1982;204;Terrence Howard is also very good here.
I:1982;205;Director Jon Favreau (who also co. stars) does a splendid job of making every scene bounce, giving it this vibrant energy that keeps the audience hooked from the very beginning.
I:1982;206;This is a truly enjoyable and memorable superhero movie, filled with effortless charisma, engaging action and truly inspired performances.
I:1982;207;this has been a great year for superheros.
I:1982;208;it stayed pretty true to the comic book.
I:1982;209;the supporting cast was wonderful (I really enjoyed Jeff Bridges in his role).
I:1982;210;but overall, it was a very, very entertaining film.
I:1982;211;oh, and the line before the credits rolled (I'm pretty sure it was the last line of the movie) was great!I still believe that The Dark Knight was the best summer movie to be released this year, and for that matter, the best superhero movie ever made, but I think Iron Man is right up there with the best.
I:1982;212;Best Movie of 2008, Robert Downey Jr shows his wide range playing Tony Stark.
I:1982;213;Let me say: A lot of times I go to a movie with high expectations and, though the movie may be good, come out disappointed.
I:1982;214;He positively owns the part, stealing the show in pretty much every scene he is in.
I:1982;215;The acting is excellent, partly due to the screenplay, which is well paced and funny.
I:1982;216;Robert Downey Jr. is so good as the title character.
I:1982;217;This one goes even farther in that way: This film is actually set in the real world.
I:1982;218;iron Man is my new favorite superhero, and he may very well become yours.
I:1982;219;If you enjoyed The Dark Knight, you'll love Iron Man.
I:1982;220;It's entertaining, funny, action packed, and tons of fun to watch.
I:1982;221;His captors make a deal with him, build them his new missile system and they will give him his freedom.
I:1982;222;So Tony Stark does what any smart alec, fashionably hip genius would do.
I:1982;223;Once back on home soil he finds he has a new purpose in life and uses his weapons and inventive genius to target and torment those who are using his weapons for their evil gain.
I:1982;224;Once Stark's chest mounted arc reactor is powered up the movie blasts off and you're on the edge of your seat for the ride.
I:1982;225;Love, allegiance, and morals aren't even enough to stop Iron Man from rocketing from zero to awesome.
I:1982;226;i wouldn't normally refer to a movie as a must see, but if you enjoy action then this one is for you.
I:1982;227;The acting is fantastic (especially Robert Downey Jr), the action thrill ride punches you square in the chest (hopefully not in your arc reactor), and the entire film just drips with style.
I:1982;228;Robert Downey Jr. just brings the character of Tony Stark / Iron Man to life, and the whole cast works together really well.
I:1982;229;Robert Downey adds the necessary personality to make it more than just a special effects movie.
I:1982;230;new and never opened as promised.
I:1982;231;And the price was very reasonable.
I:1982;232;I had not seen any of the Iron Man movies and this was a great start!
I:1982;233;Humorous, action and an all around good escape from reality film.
I:1982;234;and Robert Downy Jr is perfect in his role.
I:1982;235;He has really changed for his first appearance in the movies'
I:1982;236;good acting, nice storyline, super graphic scenes.
I:1982;237;Movie plot was great and special effects even better.
I:1982;238;Lots of action and fun.
I:1982;239;Great for a home movie night with friends or family.
I:1982;240;Iron Man has been a favorite of mine since childhood and they got this one right.
I:1982;241;Marvel's best superhero movie to date (yes Spider.
I:1982;242;2008 saw 2 great superhero movies (Batman: The Dark Knight was probably the best movie in 2008) that did not disappoint.
I:1982;243;robert Downey Jr. was marvelous.
I:1982;244;I saw the movie just recently, and I have to say, it is the best one I have seen yet.
I:1982;245;Good effects, storyline, everything is perfect and there are funny moments ever so often.
I:1982;246;Downey is great in this movie you love to hate him at times.
I:1982;247;The obviously good since it launched the series.
I:1982;248;Thanks amazon you have come true again!
I:1982;249;It's about as epic as it sounds.
I:1982;250;This movie has everything from comedy to action.
I:1982;251;Iron Man opens with a breathtaking view of a desert.
I:1982;252;That scene in the car with Dowry Jr. is probably one of the best scenes in the movie.
I:1982;253;The director does a good job of easing you into the movie and then he hits you with an explosion.
I:1982;254;Iron Man is warm, funny, action.
I:1982;255;Whoever came up with the costume design for the suit is a genius.
I:1982;256;If you have a chance I would definitely recommend this movie.
I:1982;257;Downey is great in the movie with great action.
I:1982;258;Iron Man is one of the more successful Marvel adaptations and Robert Downey Jr captures the carefree Tony Stark very well.
I:1982;259;his literal heart has some problems, which reflects the virtual heart that he develops during the course of the movie.
I:1982;260;He fully inhabits this character and those familiar with his work will find him at first nearly unrecognizable, yet his acting talent is displayed to excellent effect.
I:1982;261;The ending news conference is somewhat surprising, but on reflection, totally in character for the reckless Iron Man.
I:1982;262;The move was great and loved that I could watch it immediately after purchasing it.
I:1982;263;Definitely recommend using Amazon Instant Video.
I:1982;264;This was a fabulous movie.
I:1982;265;If you like the Comic book genre, this is one of the best out there.
I:1982;266;Robert Downey Junior delivered the character incredibly.
I:1982;267;I would definitely see it repeatedly, loved it.
I:1982;268;It is a great movie theater film.
I:1982;269;Robert Downey Jr. is awesome as Iron man.
I:1982;270;I really enjoyed this film.
I:1982;271;Its production is awesome to look at and Downey JunioVoice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breathr brings great fun to the Iron man character!
I:1982;272;Good action, fair story line, great animation and special effects.
I:1982;273;I had doubts about Robert Downy, Jr. in the lead role, but his performance was very good.
I:1982;274;An interesting update from the original Marvel story where Stark was injured in Viet Nam.
I:1982;275;man, X. men, or Batman comic in existence.
I:1982;276;so I like superhero movies.
I:1982;277;man and X. men films and I, to this day, still don't understand what's so good about the new Superman movie (but then again I always thought that character was silly).
I:1982;278;On the one hand, the previews looked good, the ratings from critics were astounding (the best rated film this year!)
I:1982;279;So I had high expectations.
I:1982;280;surprisingly, given the fact that the script wasn't finished at the time of filming, the story is one of Iron Man's strongest points.
I:1982;281;the story of Tony Stark's transformation from billionaire to superhero is handled alot better than many origin stories, which often come off as what they are .
I:1982;282;preludes, prologues, promises for a bigger story.
I:1982;283;But Iron Man, like Batman Begins delivers a story that both promises more (particularly in the last scenes of both) but at the same time delivers a fun and complete story in of itself.
I:1982;284;tony Stark, of course, steals the show and not least because of the acting behind him.
I:1982;285;But he also stands on his own as a wry, egotistical, and intelligent superhero who stands out from just about every other superhero.
I:1982;286;It's a nice juggling act and done well here.
I:1982;287;Thankfully they figure that out and moved on, turning him once again into a super.
I:1982;288;soldier, though one with a strong set of moral boundaries.
I:1982;289;Although near the end of the film his character declines into cliches throughout about 80% of the film he's as engaging as Stark himself.
I:1982;290;And that's how it's meant to be and that's how it should be.
I:1982;291;Why is it that superhero girlfriends have always got to be absolutely unmissable?The special effects in Iron Man are pretty good .
I:1982;292;But, Robert Downey Jr. (as the titular Iron Man / Tony Stark) and Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane) are the true stars of this film and fill out their roles wonderfully, bringing wit and life to the characters they play.
I:1982;293;overall, Iron Man is a brilliant superhero film that, alongside The Dark Knight, has helped to reinvigorate the genre.
I:1982;294;Robert Downey suprises everyone in this one.
I:1982;295;But he shines in this onewhich is the better of the two Iron Man movies I have seen.
I:1982;296;for a couple of hours of fun get this on right away.
I:1982;297;I love Robert Downy Jr. so this is a plus for me.
I:1982;298;this is one of his best performances.
I:1982;299;Somewhere between the genius of Batman and Spiderman essence and the extreme ComicBookesqueness of Starship Troopers.
I:1982;300;Downey is a bit clownish and never really a convincing character in his minimal dialogue, slapstickish role .
I:1982;301;In rank with the hulk and fantastic four but not quite the 'man' enough to keep pace and face with the spider, bat, and super.
I:1982;302;It was a great entry into the series, and Robert Downey Jr. is the ONLY person that can play Iron man to its full potential.
I:1982;303;"I also love Gwyenth Paltrow (Mainly because of Coldplay
I:1982;304;Action packed, funny, and fun to watch!
I:1982;305;On a trip to demonstrate a new missile, the Jericho, which knocks out a wall of defenses with many small bombs deployed from a single shot, he is captured.
I:1982;306;He secretly builds the Iron Man suit and gets back home.
I:1982;307;Yinsen gives his life to save Tony's.
I:1982;308;Not only is he a new man with his morals, but, with his view about weapons.
I:1982;309;His partner, Obadiah Stane, is in cahoots with the enemy.
I:1982;310;He sanctioned Stark's capture, and is the one selling Stark products.
I:1982;311;He double crosses the enemy, and acquires the Iron Man prototype suit and plans.
I:1982;312;He's the Hugh Hefner lookalike.
I:1982;313;the acting is solid, with Downey spot.
I:1982;314;the movie's messages: heroes are men who do the right thing even if it means sacrifice, and, bigger guns do not necessarily lead to peace.
I:1982;315;having purpose and vision .
I:1982;316;This brings the movie from sheer pulp to something with depth.
I:1982;317;He is, though, a man on a mission.
I:1982;318;That's a pretty good idea for all of us.
I:1982;319;the terrorists here are put in their proper light, but as they murder, it is very realistic and frightening.
I:1982;320;Best of the three movies.
I:1982;321;Okay, now this is a comic book superhero movie done right.
I:1982;322;While I've had issues with Marvel movies in the past,his time they hit the nail on the head.
I:1982;323;The casting of Robert Downey Junior as Tony Stark was an excellent choice, considering his own troubled past with alcohol and drugs.
I:1982;324;The custome design on the suit is also spot on.
I:1982;325;Gwyneth Paltrow is great as the feisty personal assistant Pepper Potts.
I:1982;326;The action scenes were intense and everything you'd expect out of a comic book based property.
I:1982;327;You can tell the director and cast had a lot of fun as it shows in the on screen chemistry.
I:1982;328;This is a good, fun time and a definite must.
I:1982;329;Hopefully they can carry the moment of this on throughout the series
I:1982;330;The entire movie doesnt rest on special affects alone to carry some weight.
I:1982;331;the best parts of this movie are when Tony Stark first tests out his revised Iron Man suit design.
I:1982;332;These scenes have the joy of discovery and flight I have not seen since Flight of the Navigator and are absolutely some of my favorite Iron Man scenes between this movie and The Avengers.
I:1982;333;if you are interested in watching any of the Avengers Movies, please watch this one first.
I:1982;334;It is a lot of fun.
I:1982;335;Keep up the good work and thank you Amazon and the company that sent me my item.
I:1982;336;rich genius engineer and unstoppable womaniser who builds extremely lethal weapons for the US military.
I:1982;337;hour video surveillance, is able to build a massive robot suit armed with flamethrowers and a jetpack instead of the promised missile, and is able to effect an escape, although sadly not to the theme tune from The A. team.
I:1982;338;His portrayal of Stark works excellently, despite the highly dubious writing, and I suspect his best moments were all ad.
I:1982;339;There's also a lot of guff about a new energy source Stark spontaneously created in his Afghan cave that dozens of the finest scientists in the world cannot replicate in their state.
I:1982;340;written film I've seen since Pearl Harbour, but it's also a lot of fun, as long as you strictly remember to put your brain in neutral before watching it.
I:1982;341;I admit that growing up I was more of a DC than Marvel kid, but I still knew about the big names on the other side.
I:1982;342;Trailers to this movie looked interesting so I watched and was impressed.
I:1982;343;Great movie even if you're not a comicbook fan, and is fine for the whole family.
I:1982;344;The feature film is an outstanding example of a concise and focused plot, believable and impressive visual effects and masterful performance from the main lead.
I:1982;345;ray release is well worth the wait.
I:1982;346;I'm watching it on my PS3 and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.
I:1982;347;on to the special features, i especially enjoyed the tie.
I:1982;348;Getting to know the origin and the artist and writers that have been involved with Iron Man is rather fulfilling.
I:1982;349;Also, the detailed approach in explaining the effects and such contributed much to my enjoyment.
I:1982;350;Robert Downey Jr's screen test, the theatrical trailers, hall of armors is a nice and welcomed edition.
I:1982;351;ray releases in the future.
I:1982;352;I wholly recommend Iron Man (Ultimate Two.
I:1982;353;The movie had lots of pretty visuals.
I:1982;354;If you are oblivious to propaganda and advertising, then you may enjoy this movie.
I:1982;355;The comic book used to be much more cult and intelligent than that.
I:1982;356;This was a great introduction to Iron Man and how the character came about.
I:1982;357;This movie is fun, full of action.
I:1982;358;Downey as Tony Stark is perfect.
I:1982;359;He is naturally quick with the one liners and hilarious comebacks.
I:1982;360;The copy I got is the widescreen version, which I prefer .
I:1982;361;I hate those kinds of surprises.
I:1982;362;"i love the movie, but then, I am a fan of this type movie
I:1982;363;I believe she did an outstanding job in the supporting role as his secretary/confidant/almost love interest.
I:1982;364;The photography and computer generated flying sequence with the 2 USAF fighters is really good, in my humble opinion.
I:1982;365;This is a great action movie that brings you laughs, sighs, gripping edges of the chair, cheering, .
I:1982;366;I just wished that they had kept his friend played by the same actor in all three films as well.
I:1982;367;"Anyway Robert Downy Jr. is terrific as ""The Iron Man""."
I:1982;368;Hope to see more sequels with equally great performances.
I:1982;369;Still, I love this movie and would suggest to anyone to get this ultimate 2 disc edition.
I:1982;370;The loads of extras make it worthwhile.
I:1982;371;ray version of this film, but the FX are great and the story is good too.
I:1982;372;Children should enjoy seeing Iron Man transform and develop his costume as he makes improvements to make it bettter and better.
I:1982;373;Having read some of the Iron Man comics, this movie is spot on.
I:1982;374;This is a fun movie
I:1982;375;My wife even liked it, and she doesn't usually like my action movies.
I:1982;376;He saves the world, and brings energy independence to the USA
I:1982;377;One of the Best movies, Great Blu.
I:1982;378;ray with lots of Extras.
I:1982;379;In the process he inadvertently gives the world a new weapon.
I:1982;380;for people that are more music orientated, among the popular background songs they included the original theme from the animated series.
I:1982;381;it has all the formula and characters for today's super hero movies.
I:1982;382;with a neat twist to the comic book top gun, Robert Downey Jr. portrays industrialist Tony Stark, who creates the power armor that ultimately becomes the Iron Man power suit while being held captive by terrorists.
I:1982;383;ray edition is an outstanding way to start on the adventure or to see it again.
I:1982;384;I love Robert Downey Jr's acting in this movie, he really is iron man.
I:1982;385;I enjoyed every moment of this movie.
I:1982;386;Great movie, lots of action with some funny parts too.
I:1982;387;I really liked that they kept the language clean and you could let older kids watch with out much worry.
I:1982;388;It is still a fun movie and worth seeing.
I:1982;389;The extra material is interesting and fills in a lot of the back story that is not seen in the feature.
I:1982;390;Action scenes are well done and there is enough comic relief to keep it fun.
I:1982;391;The actors totally sell their characters.
I:1982;392;This is a great movie!!!
I:1982;393;I'm very pleased with Robert Downy Jr., his performance was the best!!!
I:1982;394;Bases on box office returns and great reviews, the public loved this movie.
I:1982;395;The critics got this one right.
I:1982;396;This really is a good movie.
I:1982;397;the strength of the movie starts with the cast.
I:1982;398;You have Oscar winners Robert Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow.
I:1982;399;Downey is excellent as Tony Stark, the rich industrialist weapons manufacturer.
I:1982;400;Perhaps the best thing about Bridges' performance is his bald head and huge beard.
I:1982;401;The rest of the cast is stellar.
I:1982;402;The sountrack is great and the set designs (like Stark's house) are incredible.
I:1982;403;This is a fun movie and I know I'll never read an Iron Man comic book, but I can't wait for the next movie.
I:1982;404;Ironman is a top notch superhero movie!!
I:1982;405;Do yourself a favor and go see it in theaters!
I:1982;406;The movie had a wonderful cast including:Terence Howard .
I:1982;407;personally I thought Gwyneth Paltrow was great in her role.
I:1982;408;The movie itself has a great story, great back story and outstanding ending.
I:1982;409;the Spiderman trilogy was good, Iron Man is on a whole other level!See this one!
I:1982;410;With movies like Iron Man, I can see why.
I:1982;411;If you've read enough of my reviews lately, you'll see I'm quite a big comic book fan myself so it is great news for me.
I:1982;412;Instead of building the weapon for the enemy, he builds a fantastic suit of armor to escape by.
I:1982;413;Even though I actually loved The Dark Knight and know that some things in that movie could actually happen, this movie made it more believable for me.
I:1982;414;all in all, Iron Man is a wildly believable and fun ride.
I:1982;415;I found this to be entertaining.
I:1982;416;I liked it better than Fantastic 4 part 2, and Spiderman 2 and 3.
I:1982;417;Robert Downey Jr. is as charming as he is funny as ever.
I:1982;418;"Although ""Iron Man"" may be known best as an iconic piece of machinery in the Marvel universe, it is Downey's solid performance that captivates us the audience, making this film very enjoyable to watch from beginning to end."
I:1982;419;I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater.
I:1982;420;It has great action, a good cast, and cool special effects.
I:1982;421;I liked this movie very much, love to see RObert D, and the other characters.
I:1982;422;use the 'first California flight' scene for the Wow!
I:1982;423;one of the best BD superhero movies to own .
I:1982;424;popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.
I:1982;425;to start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character.
I:1982;426;Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good.
I:1982;427;Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges (Tideland), I found myself repulsed by his money.
I:1982;428;kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic.
I:1982;429;another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI.
I:1982;430;It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).
I:1982;431;"i also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue:Stark: ""Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial."
I:1982;432;Stark: Good god, you're a woman!
I:1982;433;Stark: Well you actually have excellent bone structure there.
I:1982;434;This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.
I:1982;435;"deserving of the title ""blockbuster."""
I:1982;436;You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.
I:1982;437;Absolutely excellent movie IMO and the Blu.
I:1982;438;He was the best choice I think they could have made to play Tony Stark, and the movie benefits greatly from his presence.
I:1982;439;I am a big fan of the comic series and was also happy to find that this was one of the better ones made, so far.
I:1982;440;A movie that blows away the competition and leaves the viewer wanting more.
I:1982;441;Robert Downey Jr is definitely at his best, Jeff Bridges performance is equal as well.
I:1982;442;It was good, But I would have prefere it to be lighter in the background of the movie it was dark.
I:1982;443;The rest of the movie was good.
I:1982;444;For me, Iron Man is the best origin movie ever made.
I:1982;445;It doesn't just manage to deliver a little bit of everything but it does it with style and integrity.
I:1982;446;Iron Man is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front.
I:1982;447;The mega talented cast fit each main character perfectly and the story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner.
I:1982;448;The dialogue is witty and what humor there is works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story.
I:1982;449;What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult.
I:1982;450;This is truly moviemaking of the most entertaining order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike.
I:1982;451;this is a great movie for all ages.
I:1982;452;when good triumphs over evil it's always a good thing!
I:1982;453;This is a really wonderful movie .
I:1982;454;visually stunning, and full of excitement and fun.
I:1982;455;Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job with this leading role, and his supporting cast is excellent.
I:1982;456;It's nice to see Jeff Bridges in this movie.
I:1982;457;"i'm not much of a comic book fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed ""Ironman"" from start to finish."
I:1982;458;make sure you sit through ALL of the credits in order to see a fun bit at the end of the film.
I:1982;459;love it, love it, love it .
I:1982;460;Not only is it thrilling and fun Robert D is perfect and fits the roll to a T!
I:1982;461;great acting, good start of story like the graphic , now will see the remaining one .
I:1982;462;The movie from amazon was flawless , great picture
I:1982;463;Spiderman was fine, but all the rest of the lot were.
I:1982;464;Iron Man is well casted, well played, and indeed, well made.
I:1982;465;The humour works, for a change, and although this film absolutely is sci.
I:1982;466;It is made believable, or at least acceptable.
I:1982;467;So you have a superhero who tells everyone who he is.
I:1982;468;the Suit though was cool and sleek.
I:1982;469;A very good interpetation of the Iron Man Comic Uniform.
I:1982;470;An Ok film with a defeatist ending imho.
I:1982;471;The Iron Man bust is small at about 1:6 scale, but has a solid weight and attention to detail that even non.
I:1982;472;The $50 gift card is good through 2009, and more then covers the extra cost for the set.
I:1982;473;"One
I:1982;474;This isn't some cheap bit of molded plastic, it's a genuine collectible.
I:1982;475;This was the best movie of 2008, in my opinion.
I:1982;476;Great movie, great acting, and it is a lot of fun to watch.
I:1982;477;Robert Downey is at his best, and so are the other actors.
I:1982;478;A must see and should be part of anyone's BD collection.
I:1982;479;Many good in depth reviews here, but plainly put this is a well scripted movie with a cast to pull it off.
I:1982;480;I love the storyline and Robert Downey Jr., in all very well he play this character.
I:1982;481;I look forward to the sequels and many more stories from the marvel comic books.
I:1982;482;Robert Downy is the best and getting better!!
I:1982;483;I hope he will stay on the track he's on and keep the great Avengers, and Ironman stories.
I:1982;484;One of my favorite movies.
I:1982;485;It is fun to watch and keeps the idealistic idea from the comic books alive.
I:1982;486;Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie.
I:1982;487;I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can.
I:1982;488;Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film!
I:1982;489;This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level.
I:1982;490;"Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable."
I:1982;491;He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality.
I:1982;492;I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity.
I:1982;493;Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods.
I:1982;494;It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.
I:1982;495;the amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish.
I:1982;496;What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects.
I:1982;497;As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot.
I:1982;498;in Iron Man , he elevates what could have been just another comic book hero movie with his completely engaging performance.
I:1982;499;Let's face it, even tho I was a comic book fan, and like these movies, their numbers in recent years has approached overkill.
I:1982;500;When he has troubles with the suit, his alarm infuses us as does the slapstick of his early mistakes.
I:1982;501;i hold back one star because the story REALLY could have used a lot more imagination.
I:1982;502;This Film is a winner i've seen it twice, it's a must see this summer.
I:1982;503;now they actually made a good apt from a comic book finally .
I:1982;504;spidey was good but this one has a better balance of being light and funny plus dramatic for all around fun treat.
I:1982;505;The cast is just excellent, props to the person that did the casting for this picture.
I:1982;506;the most enjoyable film i've in quite sometime.
I:1982;507;robert Downey Jr. really made this movie shine.
I:1982;508;He completely owned every scene he was in.
I:1982;509;Iron Man successfully walked the fine line of taking itself seriously enough that you actually care about what happens without becoming so serious that the whole movie collapses under its own weight.
I:1982;510;"And Favreau does a great job of keeping ""Iron Man"" moving."
I:1982;511;ray transfer is excellent, and the special features are enjoyable.
I:1982;512;"Perhaps the most special feature is after the end credits, a la Ferris Bueller
I:1982;513;Well, I guess I'm going to jump on the `Iron Man' bandwagon and admit that I loved the film from beginning to end.
I:1982;514;Michael Downey Jr. delivers a masterful performance in the role of Tony Stark, former weapons prodigy and multi.
I:1982;515;His call to action takes the former of Iron Man, a metal clad crusader who's all but impervious to conventional weaponry, has the ability to fly at supersonic speeds and comes equipped with the best technology of the day to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible.
I:1982;516;I also enjoyed Gwyneth Paltrow as his long.
I:1982;517;time executive assistant and future love interest.
I:1982;518;"The chemistry between the two was palpable and believable.Yes, `Iron Man' receives high marks across the board
I:1982;519;A number of previous reviews have made the statement that the special effects don't live up to expectations.
I:1982;520;I loved Iron Man comic books when I was a kid.
I:1982;521;I always wanted to see what Iron Man looked like moving, flying and punching in real.
I:1982;522;"This is my all time favorite movie, right next to ""The Lincoln Lawyer""."
I:1982;523;I also enjoyed the sophisticated voice activated and control machinery and computerized technology of his workshop.
I:1982;524;It would be great to see a continuation of this movie like a sequel.
I:1982;525;i tried to watch this with an open mind.
I:1982;526;ok, let's be brutally honest here.
I:1982;527;what's good?The acting, the script, the FX of course.
I:1982;528;A great way to spend an evening and yet another movie I wish I had taken the time to see in the theater.
I:1982;529;love the movie, love the song.
I:1982;530;Sometimes you get a good one that captures the heart of what made the comic book popular (Spider.
I:1982;531;Iron Man has captured that perfect feel for a comic book movie.
I:1982;532;He has this smirky personality yet he manages to stay down to earth at the same time.
I:1982;533;You actually feel for this character and laugh in the moments he's creating the armor (the jet boot sequences are hilarious).
I:1982;534;It's a perfect origin story that remains true to the comics while still giving us something new.
I:1982;535;There's a hint in the movie).
I:1982;536;perhaps the biggest and greatest fanboy moment of all comes after the credits have finished rolling.
I:1982;537;The final one minute sequence sets the stage perfectly for where Jon wants to take the movies in the future.
I:1982;538;Just like Sam Raimi captured the essence of Spider.
I:1982;539;Finally bit the bullet and ordered this gem!
I:1982;540;I tried cycling the power and discovered that it played.
I:1982;541;"I was able to see the movie, but I'll have to exchange the disc for a ""fixed"" one."
I:1982;542;live content will be once I'm able to view it?The graphics/composition of the menus is very cool .
I:1982;543;the best I've seen in a sci.
I:1982;544;Cheers and Good luck, Brian
I:1982;545;This movie continuously provides so much suspense and adventure that it's impossible for you to take your eyes off the screen.
I:1982;546;One of the best movies I've seen!
I:1982;547;Hands down, one of the best superhero movies I seen in the last 10 years.
I:1982;548;No matter how often I see this movie, I always enjoy it.
I:1982;549;One of the best superhero movies I've seen!
I:1982;550;And the convenience of Amazon instant is great.
I:1982;551;ray player, and I popped Iron Man in and it played perfectly, with NO playback issues.
I:1982;552;Good sound and special effects.
I:1982;553;This is a good movie, a little scary for littler children who want to see it because its about a Superhero.
I:1982;554;Hands down, the best movie of the year!!!
I:1982;555;Clean but very exciting, kinda like the Bourne movies.
I:1982;556;This has to be the best Marvel movie so far.
I:1982;557;It is like reading a well written classic novel.
I:1982;558;The movie is well structured from start to finish.
I:1982;559;What I want to say is that the Ego, Super.
I:1982;560;live never works with my PS3.
I:1982;561;overall, this is a great movie.
I:1982;562;"disc Special Collectors' Edition)One of the top 5 superhero films ever, right up there with ""The Dark Knight"", ""Spider."
I:1982;563;You can really witness how much love Jon Favreau has for the source material.
I:1982;564;The film is well made, brilliantly paced, and has terrific performances throughout.
I:1982;565;scenes documentaries to keep you occupied.
I:1982;566;It's am awesome movie with great special effects.
I:1982;567;Robert Downey Jr. plays the part of the millionaire playboy/genius/iron man very well in my opinion.
I:1982;568;I was completely satisfied with this product.
I:1982;569;Robert Downey Jr. without a doubt made this film what it is, he delivers his very special brand of charisma and acting talent to a very cool and charismatic character.
I:1982;570;He manages to break out, but comes to realise what he's been doing has been the main force in a lot of innocent killings, so he designs a better version of the suit which he will use to help those in need.
I:1982;571;downey Jr. has always been known as one of those special actors that will constantly put on amazing performances in little known movies, and very rarely gets a chance at a big time role.
I:1982;572;all in all a great movie with some spectacular special effects, great action and actually a great message.
I:1982;573;When I was a kid Iron Man was my favorite comic book so I was happy about this transition to the screen.
I:1982;574;The story, acting, directing, effects, and music were excellent.
I:1982;575;I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy action movies.
I:1982;576;"If you enjoyed this catch ""Batman Begins"" and ""Hellboy""."
I:1982;577;It is a good rendition,of the character.
I:1982;578;All the actors and actresses did a excellent job.
I:1982;579;Timing was very important, they held up good considering a few weak moments but, over all a very good job.
I:1982;580;Big fan of Tales of supsense, also.
I:1982;581;I hope they do Just as good a job on Thor as well.
I:1982;582;Iron Man is a great flick.
I:1982;583;at least worth a four star rating.
I:1982;584;This is probably the best movie based on an Avengers character.
I:1982;585;I'd wager to bet it'll likely be best Marvel movie.
I:1982;586;kool movie Interesting how they developed the plot.
I:1982;587;Kids should love it especially small boys.
I:1982;588;I think it was a really good movie.
I:1982;589;It did have its rough moments but it was overall a fantastic movie.
I:1982;590;I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother.
I:1982;591;This is another one for one of my grandsons, but I found it to be a favorite of mine too.
I:1982;592;I usually don't care for Robert Downey, Jr., but he has made the Iron Man series most enjoyable.
I:1982;593;ray player is a Panasonic brand) got it right with the Blu.
I:1982;594;again, the movie is fantastic, but if you want the true theater experience, you have to watch it in Blu.
I:1982;595;The producers of this movie surely knew what a fan would enjoy.
I:1982;596;a delightful movie even if your not a comic book fan.
I:1982;597;Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast.
I:1982;598;A great story and a visually pleasing movie.You get alot for your money.
I:1982;599;This is a fantastic movie!
I:1982;600;I got it for an such an amazing price!
I:1982;601;Would recommend it to anyone that likes comic books or action movies.
I:1982;602;alot of people thought that it was goign to be just another crapy marvel movie like fantastic four it was actually really good.
I:1982;603;Great way to bring the story to life, effects off the hook.
I:1982;604;RDJ brings it as Tony Stark and just makes the character larger than life.
I:1982;605;wish it will have cc or subtitles in other languages, will help a lot when ur kids are sleeping and you are up for a movie night.
I:1982;606;Love the story, love the characters and the actors who fleshed them out and love the visual aspects of the film!
I:1982;607;This is one of the greatest Marvel movies i have ever seen.
I:1982;608;Also with great acting by Robert Downey Jr. (as always) and the beautiful Gweneth Paltrow.
I:1982;609;The story magnificently tells the story of Iron Man while sending a message about the war in Iraq.
I:1982;610;Dazzling special effects and action sequences that will blow your mind.
I:1982;611;Robert Downey Jr. is sooo great in this film.
I:1982;612;You will be intrigued from start to finish!
I:1982;613;A great movie for the whole family!
I:1982;614;Love this movie, it's a must.
I:1982;615;Any superhero movie is good!
I:1982;616;Saw this at the theater and had to have it!
I:1982;617;i am a huge fan of marvel movies.
I:1982;618;old little brother, the biggest ghostbusters fan ever, loves it too!
I:1982;619;he escapes, but his companion, yensi, is killed.
I:1982;620;"his best friend, James ""rhodey"" rhodes, finds him walking around in the desert and returns him to america."
I:1982;621;well thats all i can tell you you'll just have to see it yourself
I:1982;622;My whole family loves this movie!
I:1982;623;The price was great and this movie shipped really quickly.
I:1982;624;I would recommend this movie to everyone who like action movies.
I:1982;625;Good plot, good acting, cool computer animation.
I:1982;626;Definitely watch this before The Avengers, as it builds up Tony Stark's character quite nicely.
I:1982;627;The sound effects were great .
I:1982;628;Great Movie everyone else agrees!We let our children watch this movie and had to have them close their eyes in some VERY violent scenes (at times my husband was the only one watching) and we had to fast.
I:1982;629;watch all the credits you get a bonus!
I:1982;630;A gift for a friend.
I:1982;631;He likes Robert Downey very much and enjoyed this Edition of Iron Man.
I:1982;632;as an action movie with lots of explosions, fights, and great special effects.
I:1982;633;but also a sophisticated comedy poking fun at the genre.
I:1982;634;Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect choice to play bad boy/genius/arms merchant Tony Stark.
I:1982;635;It is great to see Robert Downey Jr. clean and sober after his well publicized bout with drugs.
I:1982;636;One more thing, there is a really clever reference to the game 'Operation' a generational touchstone familiar to those of Stark's generation, but one that went right over the heads of the young Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow).
I:1982;637;robert Downey Jr. did a lot of ad libs, and his quick quips and clever comebacks added quite a lot to Iron Man:.
I:1982;638;Can I ask you a couple of questions?Hogan: [whispers to Stark] She's cute.
I:1982;639;christine Everheart: I can see that.
I:1982;640;Jon Favreau did a great job of directing.
I:1982;641;Like I said, it works on many levels, much to his credit.
I:1982;642;He proved he could do a movie with a small budget, but Wow, look what he can do with a huge budget!
I:1982;643;This film reminds me a little bit of Transformers, what with the special effects and giant robotic battles, but that film also had compelling human characters to give meaning to all the sound and fury.
I:1982;644;'Iron Man,' thanks to clever direction by Favreau and the personality of Downey Jr. managed a similar feat.
I:1982;645;Favreau really 'got it' that as much as machines and technology fascinate us, it is still the human element that finally connects.
I:1982;646;The whole Tony Stark with a mechanical heart, and then when he puts on the Iron Man suit?
I:1982;647;oh, yeah, that reminds me.
I:1982;648;There is some cool music in 'Iron Man' but you keep waiting to hear the Black Sabbath tunage of the same name.
I:1982;649;Though just an instrumental version, it sounds fresh and I wondered if it was rerecorded for the film.
I:1982;650;After holding back and teasing us with it, Jon Favreau finally lets us hear it, and it sounds great.
I:1982;651;I was quite impressed with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.
I:1982;652;The whole cast did a great job as well.
I:1982;653;I enjoyed the special effects and pace of the film.
I:1982;654;This movie was fun and NEW.
I:1982;655;I love this series and loved her so very good in high definition action drama and comedy in one movie I can not ask for more
I:1982;656;It has quite a few funny dialogues.
I:1982;657;The special effects are so.
I:1982;658;This was the first movie we took him to the theater to see and he loved every second of it.
I:1982;659;I enjoyed the movie as did my family.
I:1982;660;I liked how characters were themselves throughout the movie and not morphing personality wise.
I:1982;661;Just another great movie to add to my Downey collection.
I:1982;662;Okay, so it is your standard super hero movie, but it is surprisingly entertaining.
I:1982;663;Downey plays the quirky and reluctant hero, the rich boy of a father inventor who is a mix of Walt Disney and Howard Hughes.
I:1982;664;I will have to spend time in line at the store tomorrow to return it.
I:1982;665;It is entertaining, but you need an acquired taste for the type of action presented.
I:1982;666;RDJr isn't my favorite actor, but he was perfect for this role.
I:1982;667;Paltrow played hers well, and Jeff Bridges really surprised me.
I:1982;668;One of the best combinations of story, action and SFX I know of.
I:1982;669;loved seeing the first one again
I:1982;670;These companies do the best the can to screw the consumer.
I:1982;671;The second concerns Stark's improvements of the suit as well as on the technology that is keeping him alive and how Stark tests out the suit.
I:1982;672;This is easily the most light hearted and thrilling part of the movie.
I:1982;673;All of these parts flow seamlessly into each other and overall the film is very cohesive.
I:1982;674;the acting was all first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed that the director and crew decided to bring out Paltrow's natural beauty rather than slather her face with makeup.
I:1982;675;"It really lent an edge of ""realism"" to her character."
I:1982;676;The soundtrack was also incredibly good and it all fit the movie well.
I:1982;677;I may rate it lower after rewatching it at home, but at the moment I have to say that I really enjoyed it.
I:1982;678;Robert Downey Jr. is a very talented actor and even though this was just a fun fluff piece for him to act, he did it with such finesse that it was a work of art.
I:1982;679;Iron Man is a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
I:1982;680;obviously this type of movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but the humor, action, and special effects keep the little issues way in the back of your mind.
I:1982;681;a very enjoyable movie, Highly Recommended!
I:1982;682;I found the movie funny with great special effects, and most of all I found it very refreshing to see a movie tastefully done without all the profanity that you see nowdays in movies.
I:1982;683;Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect choice for Iron Man.
I:1982;684;This is a great movie full of action and comedy (in the right spots not stupid/random funnny).
I:1982;685;I'd rate this in the top 10 movies I've seen, next to The new batman (one of the best) and the original Star Wars
I:1982;686;He may engage in ferocious battle with an equally ironclad baddie near the end of the film, but I'm going to go in a much more existential direction and say that his greatest enemy is himself.
I:1982;687;An elaborate escape scene leads to his rescue, which paves the way for a hilarious moment back in Los Angeles: as he sits in a limo refusing medical treatment, he demands that someone get him an American cheeseburger.
I:1982;688;stark's experience triggers a newfound sense of responsibility, one that inspires him to shut down the weapons division of his company and focus on more humanitarian uses for technology.
I:1982;689;he essentially got rich making and selling weapons, devices that kill and maim.
I:1982;690;This story may be pure comic book fantasy, but Tony Stark brings a realism to it that's refreshing, more so than anything ever seen from Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne combined.
I:1982;691;"It's essentially because of him that ""Iron Man"" transcends anything I've previously expected from a comic book adaptation."
I:1982;692;"He says at a press conference that he's not the superhero type, and that's really funny because I thought the same thing about Robert Downey, Jr. when I saw the first ads for ""Iron Man""
I:1982;693;A lot of cool digital effects weren't a bad touch, either.
I:1982;694;They try to force him to build a new weapon for them, and instead he builds it for himself, emerging in a suit of armor and becoming Iron Man.
I:1982;695;it's a simple plot, but it works very well.
I:1982;696;The film succeeds on several levels due largely to the good writing, excellent pacing and wonderful action.
I:1982;697;But what really brings it home is the great acting on the part of Downey, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow.
I:1982;698;Not a perfect movie, but certainly a stunning example of what the genre can do and easily the second best super hero film of 2008.
I:1982;699;Great to see Robert Downey Jr. soar as a Phoenix.
I:1982;700;All the Iron Man movies are great.
I:1982;701;ray and they are great!
I:1982;702;It said it was in excellent condition and it was not.
I:1982;703;love the tape and the place I ordered it from
I:1982;704;Awesome movie, I loved iron man.
I:1982;705;Every one out there should watch this movie, because it is so very awesome.
I:1982;706;I really loved how he caught his captors by surprise with that incredible armored suit.
I:1982;707;the things the suit is capable of is a blast to watch,in fact Fun,Fun,Fun is the most accurate way to describe this film,IMHO.
I:1982;708;highly recommended for a fun movie watching time.
I:1982;709;This is a great movie and Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect fit to play Iron Man.
I:1982;710;Robert Downey Jr. really makes the movie.
I:1982;711;But the rest of the cast is awesome, too.
I:1982;712;The actors and actresses did a wonderful job on there parts.
I:1982;713;Action flick fans will love this one.
I:1982;714;So, for one reason or another I got this item in the mail today.
I:1982;715;An awesome movie in its own right,but the combo of great acting,new superhero(to the big screen),along with excellent comic to movie transfer.
I:1982;716;Lots of action and keeps you involved the whole movie.
I:1982;717;This one, however, makes an amazing picture that has everything a superb movie should have: a good storyline, suspense, action, brilliant actors, advanced technology, great movie scores, etc. moreover, there is a sense of excellence to be felt throughout the entire movie that is recognizable in the way super.
I:1982;718;The idea of man and technology merging to form the perfect enhanced being is a core issue.
I:1982;719;The underlying theme of continuously confronting one's limits to eventually overcome them combined with the archetype of the superhero is of equal value.
I:1982;720;In fact, the protagonist presents a perfect embodiment of Iron Man which makes this movie a splendid screen adaption of the comic.
I:1982;721;This is great entertainment and I really enjoyed watching it.
I:1982;722;This is real fun and I'd recommend it.
I:1982;723;Very fast paced and fun movie ok for a family to watch with teen/pre.
I:1982;724;Nice adventure with overall decent language .
I:1982;725;Robert Downey is really good at playing the arrogant, obnoxious type of guy.
I:1982;726;The special features are very cool.
I:1982;727;I always love seeing behind.
I:1982;728;as for the movie, it's probably the best superhero movie ever.
I:1982;729;It is easily my favorite movie of '08 and I can't wait for the sequel.
I:1982;730;Marvel has done great work over the last 10 years.
I:1982;731;He plays the part well.
I:1982;732;Best action movie in a while.
I:1982;733;Movie that all ages watch and have enjoyed.
I:1982;734;I'm glad I bought this one and #2.
I:1982;735;Movie was enjoyable to watch.
I:1982;736;The action was good and the special effects were consistent with other movies in this genre.
I:1982;737;If you want the true theatre.
I:1982;738;home experience, this disc will definitely bring it to you!Downey is a great actor and a great portrayal of the troubled Stark, he comes off as a complete natural throughout the whole film.
I:1982;739;The supporting roles are all filled by extremely talented cast and that is what sets this movie aside from previous Marvel films like the Spiderman films or HULK, which rely too much on the superhero factor and don't seem to worry too much about the cast.
I:1982;740;oh and this definitely is not a movie that should be limited to any specific audience as it is something I would watch with anyone from a little brother to a friend, my mother or grandmother, it is an enjoyable, reasonably realistic film for just about anyone.
I:1982;741;Great acting, intense action, hilarious moments, just great through and through.
I:1982;742;Arguably the best one in the trilogy that is now out.
I:1982;743;"frame version for those of us who hate trying to see what's between the two black panels?The script is well written and the movie's well cast
I:1982;744;"i never thought, with technology being as good as it is today, that I'd be sitting back in a theater seat and thinking, ""Fake!"
I:1982;745;I received a replacement from amazon the next day, and it worked perfectly.
I:1982;746;"Now here is a ""comic"" book movie."
I:1982;747;Plus we got that real cool set up for the Avengers.
I:1982;748;It shows that you can stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film.
I:1982;749;It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron man.
I:1982;750;I underestimated Downey's skills and truly enjoyed him in this movie.
I:1982;751;Really good adaptation of another Marvel superhero.
I:1982;752;Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.
I:1982;753;despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good.
I:1982;754;It's all in good proportion.
I:1982;755;the most fun to watch.
I:1982;756;(If you have a chance, catch this on Blu.
I:1982;757;ray as the transfer is terrific).
I:1982;758;clone is fun to see, too.
I:1982;759;"some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special."
I:1982;760;it looks fantastic on Blu.
I:1982;761;Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer carrying on the legacy of his late father in designing bigger and better weapons to protect this great land of ours.
I:1982;762;The terrorists want Stark to build them one of his new missiles, but seeing them using his weaponry, devices he created to protect Americans, which there should be no way they could have, Stark has a figurative change of heart to go along with his literal one.
I:1982;763;Downey is totally committed and up to the game, giving Stark a roguish charm that is simply perfect, and he's not afraid to let the identity hiding armor take over when Iron Man shows up.
I:1982;764;man, director Favreau can cut to close.
I:1982;765;ups of Downey inside the armor, so we the audience still get to see all the emotions the actor's face can show without having to rip the hero's mask off in every scene.
I:1982;766;The casting is perfect down the line, with every actor and actress looking exactly like the comics' version, and that extends to the moment after the credits too many people will have missed, a fine bit that promises more fun to come AND ties this film directly to another summer release this year.
I:1982;767;All in all a fun flick I highly recommend to those so inclined.
I:1982;768;Iron Man is one of those all too rare big budget movies that actually delivers.
I:1982;769;Downey was born to play Tony Stark but the real hero of this movie is the screenplay.
I:1982;770;A well written story, great charactors and terrific special effects.
I:1982;771;The son of Howard Stark, also a genius.
I:1982;772;He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it.
I:1982;773;It holds Downey's best performance in a long time.
I:1982;774;"It is a fun, comic actioner that sure comes close to a ""perfect film""."
I:1982;775;I got hooked on Agents of SHIELD on TV and decided I needed to go back and start at the beginning.
I:1982;776;Iron Man was a pleasant surprise and it helped set the stage for some of the things I've seen on the TV series.
I:1982;777;I enjoyed seeing how it all started.
I:1982;778;Love Roberts humor and acting style.
I:1982;779;The kids really enjoyed it with us.
I:1982;780;Thanks for black friday i got it!
I:1982;781;I really liked this movie.
I:1982;782;Of all the comic to movie renditions this is one of the better ones.
I:1982;783;But, this one's a keeper.
I:1982;784;It's full of action and just plain fun!
I:1982;785;Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;786;In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.
I:1982;787;On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction.
I:1982;788;buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil.
I:1982;789;The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role.
I:1982;790;Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda.
I:1982;791;Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them.
I:1982;792;The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend.
I:1982;793;favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark.
I:1982;794;driving it, are realistic and at times amusing.
I:1982;795;The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable.
I:1982;796;My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice.
I:1982;797;Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.
I:1982;798;there is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun.
I:1982;799;The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative.
I:1982;800;The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.
I:1982;801;"the second disc starts off with the impressive ""I Am Iron Man,"" a 108 minute making of documentary that can be viewed in seven segments or altogether, taking us through various aspects of the production."
I:1982;802;It's amazing how much of the suit is practical and looks really good in person.
I:1982;803;This is due in large part to the genius of the late.
I:1982;804;great Stan Winston and his company.
I:1982;805;Also included is plenty of soundstage footage of scenes being filmed.
I:1982;806;The Invincible Iron Man is a six.
I:1982;807;part documentary on the comic book, tracing the history of the character.
I:1982;808;He also mentions that he was never fully satisfied with the look of the armor .
I:1982;809;This doc also covers various key characters and storylines in excellent detail with several people who worked on the title over the years talking about their contribution to the mythos.
I:1982;810;This is a very well done overview of the comic book.
I:1982;811;Director Jon Favreau says that he likes to use practical effects whenever possible, which is wonderfully refreshing to hear, and in this film he mixed the practical with CGI.
I:1982;812;The Actor's Process features fascinating footage of Jeff Bridges and Downey rehearsing a scene with Favreau.
I:1982;813;It's great to see these guys at work and offers insight into how they put together a scene from the film from an acting point.
I:1982;814;"length Film"" is a funny satire where a newscaster ""breaks"" a story of how the Iron Man trailer will be made into a film that pokes fun at the rabid nature of the hardcore fanbase of the character."
I:1982;815;"finally, there are ""Galleries,"" featuring concept art, technology stills, behind."
I:1982;816;scenes photographs, and poster art.
I:1982;817;Good movie, arrived fast, great price.
I:1982;818;I loved this movie and I would recomend this to any ironman comic fan or just any fan of the actors/actresses in this movie.
I:1982;819;"It will never win the ""O"" in EGOT."
I:1982;820;"There have been many good adaptations of comic book stories coming to theatres lately
I:1982;821;Iron Man is an enjoyable addition to this growing catalog of films, but it could have been truly outstanding with a few additions.
I:1982;822;the movie underutilizes its two best assets: Tony Stark, and the suit.
I:1982;823;Iron Man's combat suit is quite impressive, is equipped with a wide assortment of weapons, and seems to have enormous potential for elaborate action scenes.
I:1982;824;As for the man inside the suit, the character of Tony Stark is quite entertaining to watch when he's free to exchange verbal barbs with another character, or when he is let loose to adopt the larger.
I:1982;825;The daytime exterior shots are very nice, showing plenty of detail.
I:1982;826;ray that handled them perfectly.
I:1982;827;ray is quite good, similar to (and maybe just a touch better than) Spiderman 3.
I:1982;828;Downey certainly brings the right touch to a hero with flaws.
I:1982;829;Talk about popcorn, soda and excellent entertainment factor!
I:1982;830;This is a great movie and something that youreally should see.
I:1982;831;I really thought that themovie was enjoyable and totally fun to watch.
I:1982;832;It's writing at its best.
I:1982;833;"so it had cool gadgets
I:1982;834;This flick was worth more than the price of three admissions.
I:1982;835;The rah rah Americanism will please the hard line neo.
I:1982;836;cons and the gadgets and firestorm Fx will appeal to geeks and kids alike.
I:1982;837;best of all, this movie had heart.
I:1982;838;Downey/Stark represents the dichotomy that lives inside of each of us.
I:1982;839;Robert Downey Jr is perfection as Iron Man.
I:1982;840;Also Gwennyth Paltro is great as Pepper Potts.
I:1982;841;I love all 3 movies and most of these comic book films.
I:1982;842;Iron Man 2 is a very entertaining movie especially if you are a Marvel fan to begin with.
I:1982;843;As with all of the Marvel movies if you can sit through the credits you will find a little bit more of the movie which will set the stage for the next marvel movie.
I:1982;844;We loved it and would recommend it to anyone for family viewing.
I:1982;845;This is one of the best superhero movies ever made so far.
I:1982;846;iron Man the movie, is a fun ride.
I:1982;847;But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.
I:1982;848;A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.
I:1982;849;His company (created by his father, co. run by Obediah Stane) provides high.
I:1982;850;i am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.
I:1982;851;"Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder
I:1982;852;dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under.
I:1982;853;"The script is superb
I:1982;854;Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let.
I:1982;855;Of course, as good as the first two.
I:1982;856;"And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel
I:1982;857;"But overall, ""Iron Man"" is just a good time."
I:1982;858;It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.
I:1982;859;This is one of the best superheroes moives you will ever see.
I:1982;860;This was a big surprise for me.
I:1982;861;At first I wasn't too interested but after seeing the trailer and reading the good reviews I got interested and went to see it.
I:1982;862;Robert Downey Junior is excellent.
I:1982;863;The action scenes and special effects were great.
I:1982;864;man 2&3 but probably not as good as Batman Begins.
I:1982;865;"Based on Stan Lee's comic book, ""Ironman"" comes to the big screen."
I:1982;866;Ironman seems as an appealing superhero movie inasmuch as it has action sequences, a genuine script, and a pleasant acting.
I:1982;867;He has a playboy personality, that's why he is always surrounded by women (most of them models).
I:1982;868;a positive element in this film, directed by Jon Favreau (Elf, 2003), is the special effects which we can notice in the engaging action scenes, also the locations where these fights are being held are fantastic, and the high technology used in the movie is amazing.
I:1982;869;The concise and accomplished script is funny and engaging, too, we can understand well the personality of each character, it has some funny lines (typical of Marvel's films) and there is a contrastive variety of scenes and situations that are going to keep you glued to your seat.
I:1982;870;the most remarkable point in this movie is the main characters' awesome acting.
I:1982;871;One of the best performances is Gwyneth Paltrow's, starring as Pepper Potts, Stark's lovable and reliable assistant who has a fresh look.
I:1982;872;She is always taking care and worrying about him.
I:1982;873;"She also organizes his life
I:1982;874;Now, he is a super hero and it is a role that matches for him as well.
I:1982;875;The supporting roles are also remarkable: we got Terrence Howard as Stark's military buddy Rhodey and Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane.
I:1982;876;Overall, Iron Man is the best two.
I:1982;877;disc package available on Blu.
I:1982;878;Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job and the special effects give Iron Man a fresh, unique vibe that sets it apart from most action or superhero films.
I:1982;879;"There are enough surprises and plot twists to keep any audience on their toes
I:1982;880;Iron Man gets my highest recommendation on Blu.
I:1982;881;i give this show 5 out of 5 stars,I will rank it the highest because it deserves it,there is no better movie out there.
I:1982;882;Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect fit for millionaire play.
I:1982;883;I thought this movie was great.
I:1982;884;The acting was good, the plot flowed smoothly, and the set up for a sequel was perfect.
I:1982;885;The price is great on Amazon.
I:1982;886;what makes this 'comic book' movie great and one of the best adaptations of all time is 1 thing.
I:1982;887;robert Downey Jr. i had been a comic book fan since I was a kid, and while I mainly collected Spider.
I:1982;888;While usually the book is better than the movie, this is one of those rare exceptions where the real life version far exceeds the book.
I:1982;889;Yes the CGI is fantastic but the other people cast in the movie don't inspire the audience.
I:1982;890;Paltrow is fine, Howard I thought was good (bad move replacing a decent character who wanted to return for the sequel with Don Cheadle as good as he is), Bridges is very good but this movie belongs to Downey Jr. sometimes a basic script can be made exceptional when you find a definitive actor to play a role.
I:1982;891;Not only will this film make comic book fans happy, it is perfect for both genders, all ages, or anyone that likes movies in general.
I:1982;892;one of the greatest comic book movies of all time and a joy to watch that instantly ranks in the top 5 of said adaptations ever made.
I:1982;893;I thoroughly enjoy everything about this movie.
I:1982;894;Honestly if they stopped with this I'd be happy.
I:1982;895;Anyway fora well rounded film that give you everything you want and more get iron man.
I:1982;896;The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure!
I:1982;897;A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story.
I:1982;898;This story has absolutely zero imagination.
I:1982;899;It's at the intelligence level of a second.
I:1982;900;rate, Saturday morning cartoon!It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable!
I:1982;901;But only a rich and powerful U. s. weapons inventor and dealer can come to the rescue!
I:1982;902;What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world!
I:1982;903;It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday!I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots.
I:1982;904;They certainly could use the money!For those who think selling weapons is funny see:Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible,Lord of War (2.
I:1982;905;I've never heard of Iron Man before this movie, but this movie definitely made me a fan.
I:1982;906;Iron man is portrayed as witty, charming, and smart.
I:1982;907;His suit is an amazing work of art.
I:1982;908;Roberty Downey Jr's personality shines through naturally.
I:1982;909;All the cool gadgets and technology will keep the boys drooling.
I:1982;910;a good introducing of Iron Man to the movie audience.
I:1982;911;A remarkably excellently made, well written comic novel/movie.
I:1982;912;Really one of the must see movies.
I:1982;913;The BD Live feature is also very cool .
I:1982;914;Blu ray brings Iron Man to life and if you have a home theatre set up with your player, then get the popcorn and movie treats out and enjoy a more intense experience than you saw in the movie theatre!
I:1982;915;Now I've got to go get the Dark Knight Blu ray edition!
I:1982;916;I bought this for my oldest son.
I:1982;917;I am so glad that I found it at such a good price.
I:1982;918;hearted superhero movie with great action.
I:1982;919;One of the great pleasures of summer is the release of the big budget, popcorn films that feed the eye with amazing special effects and take the movie goer on an action.
I:1982;920;"Not all summer films achieve the goal of pleasing the masses but this new movie, based on the Marvel comic book hero, Iron Man, does just that!Robert Downey Jr., the talent and charismatic actor who received an Oscar nod for his turn in ""Chaplin"", takes on the role of Tony Stark, an extremely wealthy man whose fortune has been amassed by providing weapons to the world's warriors, good and bad."
I:1982;921;After escaping from his captors using an armor he creates during his abduction, Stark returns to the U. S. and begins working on an improved version that will allow him to fight the forces he has empowered with his own, technologically advanced weaponry.
I:1982;922;All three actors do a great job with their parts, especially Paltrow and Bridges.
I:1982;923;And, of course, there is the usual Stan Lee cameo, which is quite funny in this film.
I:1982;924;fans alike, considering its impressive take thus far, both domestically and internationally.
I:1982;925;Although I was a comic book kid growing up, I never read the Iron Man comic books but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
I:1982;926;I have to give kudos to Marvel for really making sure that their latest hero films are up to par.
I:1982;927;I like the development and action packed adventures.
I:1982;928;I really liked the story line.
I:1982;929;Robert Downey Jr really is iron man.
I:1982;930;My favorite visual and audio part is when Iron Man is flying in the sky and the 2 jets are chasing him.
I:1982;931;One of the better movies in Blu Ray.
I:1982;932;all the special features, BD live plus a digital copy to watch on your iPhone/iPod makes this a great deal!
I:1982;933;If you like these action yet funny movies, this one does not disappoint!
I:1982;934;Superfast shipping and in perfect condition.
I:1982;935;good Scifi needs villians and a lovely gal .
I:1982;936;Gwyneth filled that spot admirably.
I:1982;937;"regarded superhero movies, I feel ""Iron Man"" deserves the acclaim."
I:1982;938;It has some excellent action sequences, but also balances them with a fair amount of drama.
I:1982;939;The dialogue is witty throughout and the story has a positive message.
I:1982;940;Each cast member delivers a superb performance, led by the reinvigorated Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.
I:1982;941;The scenes with Pepper and Rhodes include many of the better moments, both dramatic and humorous.
I:1982;942;this movie works well because the action is well.
I:1982;943;done without completely overshadowing the drama and humor.
I:1982;944;The excellent writing, acting, and effects make it an enjoyable movie which loses little to nothing in repeat viewings.
I:1982;945;I just want to make it clear that I love the movie.
I:1982;946;{Like how did Obie manage to control that giant power suit so well when he had no time to practice his Ironman Kung.
I:1982;947;I found this very surprising.
I:1982;948;Certainly, such a recent master must have had many purely digital elements.
I:1982;949;Loved this intor movie and the introduction to Ironman and the other characters it introduces from the Marvel universe.
I:1982;950;I thought that Gweth did a great job as Pepper Pots.
I:1982;951;Great action and story line, now I have my kids acting like Ironman.
I:1982;952;Excellent acting as well by Robert Downey
I:1982;953;"The big screen was blessed this year with two superlative comic book adaptations, ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight""."
I:1982;954;Good acting, characters that are full bodied and make sense, good visual effects and edge.
I:1982;955;"It's like the makers of the ""Iron Man"" were so confident in it's success that they're setting you up for the sequel which, now with the film's success, is inevitable."
I:1982;956;I might elevate this film to five stars if the sequel's any good.
I:1982;957;iron man is one of my favorite superheroes.
I:1982;958;the origin of iron man is right on the spot.
I:1982;959;hopefully in iron man 3 they will finaly introduce the mandarin.
I:1982;960;This movie sets up how Iron man came to be.
I:1982;961;It is full of action and is okay for kids over 13 (in my humble opinion).
I:1982;962;I concur, it is a great, entertaining movie.
I:1982;963;robert Downey Jr. does a great job playing the playboy superhero.
I:1982;964;action packed, funny, and believable (for a comic book).
I:1982;965;Ironman is an excellent example of the power of blue ray, an extremely polished film and one that looks absolutely stunning on Blue Ray.
I:1982;966;as a movie I have found myself rewatching the first hour more than the second.
I:1982;967;The interesting thing with this film is that it is far stronger in its early stages when we are learning these facets of our hero than it is after the hero has been constructed (literally in this case).
I:1982;968;As an origin story though it is very engaging.
I:1982;969;here is hoping that ironman 2 gives us a more convincing nemesis.
I:1982;970;This is very good and the special efects are also top grade as they did not try to cut corners to save money.
I:1982;971;If you like action and drama it has plenty to give.
I:1982;972;This was a great Marvel superhero movie.
I:1982;973;but this movie was great .
I:1982;974;the plot was excellent and the CGI was VERY well done.
I:1982;975;Picture was top notch, sound was great and directing didn't get in the way of the story.
I:1982;976;this was nearly perfect .
I:1982;977;even the pacing was great.
I:1982;978;stay after the final credits to see more of the movie!
I:1982;979;Click a menu and get bonus features, sure.
I:1982;980;I was surprised how much I liked this movie.
I:1982;981;I approached it as a bit of action.
I:1982;982;There is some serious thematic material subtly woven in, for example the strength of the original heart.
I:1982;983;And our expectation about who the bad guys really are gets turned on its head.
I:1982;984;I also really loved the chemistry between RDJ and Gwyneth Paltrow.
I:1982;985;They smoked in a beautifully understated way.
I:1982;986;All in all, I found it a very satisfying 2+ hours, me who is pretty much the polar opposite of a 12.
I:1982;987;(But fear not, there is plenty in the film to satisfy that heart as well.
I:1982;988;It was the best movie i saw in the summer of 2008.
I:1982;989;acting is superbThis movie is straight up the best blu ray so far.
I:1982;990;This is one of the best if not the best Marvel Comics movie that they have made.
I:1982;991;It has great effects and great acting.
I:1982;992;Robert Downey Jr. is great in this movie.
I:1982;993;"Perfectly cast and executed tremendously with laid back ease, ""Iron Man"" is proof that Marvel still has what it takes to dish out the good stuff."
I:1982;994;robert Downey Jr. has done something with his Superhero that other actors have yet to try with theirs, .
I:1982;995;loosen up, have fun and add some humor.
I:1982;996;The screenplay does a wonderful job of adding issues that American's fear at this particular point in time, using the war on terror to make the film more realistic and envolving.
I:1982;997;The graphics are absolutely fantastic and the story line is excellent.
I:1982;998;The first Iron Man is one of the best comic book superhero movies ever made.
I:1982;999;started the Marvel movie franchise leading to the $1.5 billion Avengers flick but is also an excellent standalone film.
I:1982;1000;"Okay, the film has been out for a while so I'll start with four obvious points.1) The film is based on a Marvel comic and has been compared favorably with other comic book films
I:1982;1001;But an interesting difference between the hero in this film and the heroes of `Superman', `Batman' and `Spiderman' is that those heroes make great effort to avoid deadly force.
I:1982;1002;2) The cast is great.
I:1982;1003;Gwyneth Paltrow takes the role of Pepper Potts, the loyal assistant that could have been a clich and an offense to feminists, and makes the character into a charming blend of strength and vulnerability.
I:1982;1004;Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in the film.
I:1982;1005;It's fun to see a forty.
I:1982;1006;Downey plays the billionaire playboy munitions manufacturer as someone whose top concern is amusing himself.
I:1982;1007;Downey has given similar top drawer performances in such films as last year's Zodiac or A Scanner Darkly from the year before that.
I:1982;1008;In real life, Downey has struggled with abuse problems, and it's a pleasure to see him in such an entertaining breakout role.3) This movie is making a lot of money.
I:1982;1009;He uses the materials system to build a mechanical suit that allows him to escape.
I:1982;1010;When he returns home, he builds a bigger and better suit.
I:1982;1011;so let's take a look at how the armor of Iron Man compares to the armor of God described in Ephesians chapter 6.10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
I:1982;1012;11Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
I:1982;1013;13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
I:1982;1014;He then pursues the truth about how they obtained his weapons, knowing the exposure of the truth may have a great financial cost.
I:1982;1015;stark's whole suit is a shield.
I:1982;1016;His basic power is invulnerability.
I:1982;1017;With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.
I:1982;1018;Plenty of action and fun to watch.
I:1982;1019;I would recommend this to anyone who has seen The Avengers and wanted more.
I:1982;1020;Was really happy to find and even more happy that it got here before Christmas.
I:1982;1021;This witty, human, explosive action film sets a high standard, along with The Dark Knight, for the genre.
I:1982;1022;Iron Man emerges from this psychological low: a uniquely powered metal suit with jet packs, flame throwers, and brute strength that houses Stark.
I:1982;1023;A weapon, yes, but one designed to protect.
I:1982;1024;downey, Jr. is simply perfect for the role of Tony Stark .
I:1982;1025;he plays smarmy as well as he does brilliant, intense as well as he does comic, heartless as well as he does lovable.
I:1982;1026;"His facial expressions while ""inside"" the Iron Man suit remind us that a human we can empathize with is contained within the seemingly invincible armor."
I:1982;1027;Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet, if a little ditzy, as romantic interest Pepper Potts, but her performance stands up against Downey Jr's charismatic screen presence, not an easy feat.
I:1982;1028;the visuals are stunning, particularly on Blu.
I:1982;1029;ray, and the soundtrack is powerful.
I:1982;1030;"ray comes with two discs containing some special features of note: the creation of the special effects
I:1982;1031;This was a fun, action.
I:1982;1032;packed, and at times humorous superhero film.
I:1982;1033;Unlike some blockbusters, this film uses special effects to supplement the acting and the action, not the other way around.
I:1982;1034;I enjoyed every minute of it.
I:1982;1035;I honestly never saw or read anything about Ironman before this movie.
I:1982;1036;On the other hand, my hubby has been a comic fan for many years.
I:1982;1037;We both loved this movie.
I:1982;1038;"Robert Downey Jr puts in a cheeky performance as Tony Stark
I:1982;1039;Love to see this come to the big screen and to see the multi talented Robert Downing Jr back at his best!!
I:1982;1040;I love this movie and the series.
I:1982;1041;I will continue to watch movies like this.
I:1982;1042;Great movie for kids and adults alike.
I:1982;1043;Action packed, suspenseful, thrilling, sexy, an all around great movie!
I:1982;1044;sounds like a great system.
I:1982;1045;The streaming was fair at best.
I:1982;1046;Iron Man is one of the best movies of all times.
I:1982;1047;Just like to have these movies on hand when I want a no brainer but entertaining movie to watch
I:1982;1048;My first taste of Iron Man and I loved it.
I:1982;1049;I really loved this movie.
I:1982;1050;Robert Downey Jr. is such a good actor.
I:1982;1051;I love lot's of action in a movie and this does not disappoint.
I:1982;1052;So, suffice to say that I was quite happy with him being cast for the film.
I:1982;1053;while under captivity, Stark creates his first Iron Man uniform and uses it to escape his captors.
I:1982;1054;ray version packed with a lot of extras.
I:1982;1055;But the audio for this version is Dolby Digital 5.1 and video is widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.
I:1982;1056;minute documentary, a six part documentary and more.
I:1982;1057;ray version has received almost perfect stars for its amount of content and BD.
I:1982;1058;"ray version of ""IRON MAN"" is what is recommended."
I:1982;1059;after watching it, I definitely enjoyed the film but like any superhero film, as the first film always focuses on the origin, this series will be judged on its continuing storylines.
I:1982;1060;But with Don Cheadle replacing Howard for the next film, I hope that Cheadle can bring the attitude especially if he's going to be War Machine.
I:1982;1061;but definitely enjoyed this film.
I:1982;1062;"With ""IRON MAN"", unlike any other top tier Marvel superheroes, Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of inner demons to contend with and is such a complex character."
I:1982;1063;And of course, there is James Rhodes as War Machine and I look forward in seeing that character come to play in the films.
I:1982;1064;"but all in all, ""IRON MAN"" was an enjoyable film for the first version."
I:1982;1065;A lot of action, special effects but definitely would like to see where they go with the characters in the next upcoming film.
I:1982;1066;all in all, a very cool movie and enjoyed it so much, now I'm going to have to pick up the Blu.
I:1982;1067;It was serious and funny, as life can be.
I:1982;1068;Robert Downey Jr. is great in this film.
I:1982;1069;'Great tale and no hiccups during streaming.
I:1982;1070;I'm not a follower of comic books so found the Special Features section very informative and entertaining, adding to the enjoyment of this fine movie.
I:1982;1071;The product arrived in a very timely fashion.
I:1982;1072;I was surprised to see the product wasn't new but it was in excellent condition.
I:1982;1073;How can you hate Iron Man, Tony Stark is one of the most well constructed comic characters in the stables.
I:1982;1074;imaging of him does a great job to keep his essence while bringing him to a modern audience.
I:1982;1075;ray format brings the move even more to life with rich colors, awesome sound and crisp movement and depth.
I:1982;1076;The Bonus features are pretty nice as well.
I:1982;1077;My grandson loves this movie, I received it 3 days after I ordered it which was great!
I:1982;1078;We are very happy with the fast service
I:1982;1079;I always like Jon Favreau, but I think his real talent lies behind the camera.
I:1982;1080;I hope he stays there for years and continues to entertain us with wonderful film.
I:1982;1081;This is a great movie!
I:1982;1082;The bonus features are very entertaining.
I:1982;1083;I hope Hollywood makes more movies like this!
I:1982;1084;This is a good movie.
I:1982;1085;I'm an iron man fan anyway, so naturally I'm going to give the movie good reviews.
I:1982;1086;It was just as enjoyable as when I saw it at the theater.
I:1982;1087;This is a really good movie.
I:1982;1088;It has action and humor.
I:1982;1089;Definitely one of Robert Downey Jr.'s best characters.
I:1982;1090;I really love this movie.
I:1982;1091;Robert Downey Jr plays his part extremely well.
I:1982;1092;It is an almost believable story.
I:1982;1093;As always this is a great movie with lots of humor that keeps you laughing your way through.
I:1982;1094;The special features are great.
I:1982;1095;It's absolutely worth every penny if you enjoyed the film.
I:1982;1096;ray movies in this shipment were in perfect condition.
I:1982;1097;I have sent an email to the company and hopefully i will be able to exchange it for a non.
I:1982;1098;I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.
I:1982;1099;As advertised in very good condition.
I:1982;1100;Arrived quickly and the price was great too.
I:1982;1101;Keep up the good work!
I:1982;1102;A great movie to watch.
I:1982;1103;Special features are well above average and take you inside the movie.
I:1982;1104;But I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, and Downey's astounding performance in IRON MAN is the stellar exception to my disdain for this action hero genre.
I:1982;1105;"Downey brings a rich authenticity and ebullient eccentricity to every role he plays, and this is certainly the case here
I:1982;1106;Even rocketing through the skies in his IRON MAN suit Downey's Stark is funny, vulnerable, and pragmatic.
I:1982;1107;While demonstrating a new weapon in the Afghanistan wilderness before assembled Army VIPs he nonchalantly sips his drink while behind him chaos reigns supreme, and it's grand fun to watch.
I:1982;1108;"The special effects are terrific, the action sequences heartpounding, and the pacing fast and furious
I:1982;1109;Out of all the avengers separate movies, Iron Man is the best.
I:1982;1110;Intense action and some great laughing scenes to watch.
I:1982;1111;This is a super great film that makes you remember why we all love Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;1112;This film is so much fun.
I:1982;1113;Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreu have been more than confident they have a winner in Iron Man.
I:1982;1114;this is one great film, and sure enough one of the best of 2008 already.
I:1982;1115;There is almost a realistic feel throughout this film unlike some superhero films (but don't expect things to be believable sometimes).
I:1982;1116;In fact, the top four actors in the film have all had some big awards in their past.
I:1982;1117;This has a huge impact on Stark's life and the man he will become throughout the film (not just the superhero he becomes, but the person he becomes too).
I:1982;1118;Accompany that with great comic relief, great actors and characters, and an impressive story and you got one film you can't miss out on.
I:1982;1119;something is happening with Marvel.
I:1982;1120;Jeff Bridges was really good as the villain.
I:1982;1121;Did not think the DUDE could be a bad guy that was believable, but he was great!
I:1982;1122;iron man is quite possibly the best superhero movie of our generation.
I:1982;1123;It was a fun movie.
I:1982;1124;This is what I like to see.
I:1982;1125;I love all the marvel movie, it played great and had no problems with it.
I:1982;1126;Thank you for good savings.
I:1982;1127;It was a good action hero popcorn movie.
I:1982;1128;This is a great superhero film that the whole family can enjoy.
I:1982;1129;I've already viewed it a dozen times.
I:1982;1130;It's realistic with a fairly decent plot.
I:1982;1131;I think the all did such a good job.
I:1982;1132;Get it you'll enjoy it.
I:1982;1133;Was shipped very quickly and happy with transaction.
I:1982;1134;this movie was one hundred percent awesome I absolutely loved this movie the action was very good and I loved this movie Robert Downey JR gives an excellent performance as Tony Stark aka IronMan this has to be one of the greatest action movies since some of Robert Downey JR's other movies and I'm not insulting the guy at all I really enjoyed this movie the action in this movie was very good and I liked every second of it
I:1982;1135;Whatever the rest of the Empire can deliver in terms of entertainment (I have seen none of it), this movie was worth watching and can be recommended for pretty much all the family (old enough to know it's only actors who are being killed and they will get up to play again).
I:1982;1136;Downey and Bridges are admirable in their roles and Gwyneth Paltrow does as well as necessity to be a subdued character allows.
I:1982;1137;Audiences love, and perhaps need, that.
I:1982;1138;This was a good action packed movie but like many others I think this will be the end of Iron man.
I:1982;1139;This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where!
I:1982;1140;"Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a. k. a. Iron Man, ""ol' Shell head"" whatever you prefer."
I:1982;1141;I knew his career was about to take a very big turn for the better after this film!
I:1982;1142;man films, it's the characters who are the stars and that's what makes the FX and super hero stuff work so well.
I:1982;1143;This is one of the best Superhero films since any of the Spider.
I:1982;1144;man films with superb specials effect and witty dialogue.
I:1982;1145;i loved the little touches throughout for Marvel geeks like me.
I:1982;1146;i. e.: Tony Stark's cell phone ring was the theme song melody from the 1960's Iron Man cartoon,(totally cool)I love little things like this!
I:1982;1147;'Iron Man' takes the heart of the 'Spider.
I:1982;1148;man' films and the believable technical aspects from 'Batman Begins' and comes up with one entertaining knock out of a movie!A compelling story, a great cast, superb special effects and most of all it's FUN!
I:1982;1149;Iron Man is solid super.
I:1982;1150;hero fare which employs the traditional themes, tropes and symbols.
I:1982;1151;It should prove satisfactory to a broad audience, but could have been so much more satisfying, probing, or insightful if it used more clever storytelling.
I:1982;1152;robert Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges offer excellent performances.
I:1982;1153;Gwyneth Paltrow offers a convincing performance of a woman who sees beneath Stark's stark exterior and sees the man behind the jerk, and the suit.

I:1982;1155;up displays and Tony Stark's computers and droids were fantastic.
I:1982;1156;looking suit for a movie, but the possibility of such a suit in today's world is itself more believable.
I:1982;1157;The film is aware of this, as Stark even comments on the newspaper's characterization of him as an iron man.
I:1982;1158;The updating of the specific context from Vietnam (in the early comic books) to Afghanistan works very well, and shows that comic and superhero characters often reflect issues of their time and should be considered valuable forums for cultural dialogue.
I:1982;1159;Part of why Star Wars (Episode IV) was so engaging is that Lucas explicitly left out the explanations .
I:1982;1160;It is solid, though, and should please comic fans and general audiences.
I:1982;1161;ray disc that I watched has a nice special feature on the history of Iron Man, including interviews with Stan Lee and various other artists and writers who have worked on his stories.
I:1982;1162;Action a'plenty and I even liked the romantic tease between Paltrow and Downey.
I:1982;1163;"2008's ""Iron Man"" is a very good screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero."
I:1982;1164;Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts, his beautiful and very capable personal assistant, while a buff Jeff Bridges has a dark role as Stark's ruthless corporate deputy.
I:1982;1165;in a movie loaded with high tech and suspenseful action sequences, Downey is entirely convincing as the man in an iron mask.
I:1982;1166;I really liked this film.
I:1982;1167;It's the best Marvel Comics movie yet.
I:1982;1168;As a long time comic book fan, I find this movie fascinating for how it combines elements of the original comics with new takes on the character, all to perfectly capture his essence.

I:1982;1170;the early parts of the movie pretty much follow the 1963 origin.
I:1982;1171;Tony builds an armored chest plate that will keep the shrapnel from piercing his heart, and around that he and Yinsen design and build a crude suit of armor, somewhat paradoxically inset with all the cutting edge technological weaponry that a high.
I:1982;1172;level genius intellect, feverishly battling for freedom and against death, can invent when pushed to the edge under incredible time pressure.
I:1982;1173;stan Lee always felt that every good hero, no matter how powerful, should have a counterbalancing weakness.
I:1982;1174;Eventually this goes away when Tony's damaged heart is removed and replaced with a cybernetic heart of his own design.
I:1982;1175;Back to the early comic books, and the movie's storyline.
I:1982;1176;Up til this point, the movie is pretty much a well.
I:1982;1177;(Iron Man is always at his best when he's battling high.
I:1982;1178;They both work well as supporting characters in the movie.
I:1982;1179;the linchpin of the film is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark.
I:1982;1180;Downey Jr. can play an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high.
I:1982;1181;iQ addict (I've heard it said we'll get into Tony's alcoholism in the second film) because he is in fact an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high.
I:1982;1182;Robert Downey Jr owns this role with such aplomb that I don't think they will ever be able to find a replacement.
I:1982;1183;Great movie with a great cast!
I:1982;1184;I personally liked this better than Spider Man and every other superhero movie.
I:1982;1185;It is fun for adults and kids.
I:1982;1186;Robert Downey Jr. is awesome!
I:1982;1187;Thank you for bringing this movie into the world.
I:1982;1188;This definitely goes in my top 10 movies of the year already.
I:1982;1189;RDJ doesn't disappoint, and the supporting cast is very good.
I:1982;1190;Well the seller was very fast and professional very good description and very accurate to the condition of the blue ray video.
I:1982;1191;This movie is so fun to watch.
I:1982;1192;but it is fun at the same time, a little far fetch, but then, it is a comic book guy and the acting is good
I:1982;1193;It was great, and the fact that Blu.
I:1982;1194;A fun movie and the start of the series of flicks.
I:1982;1195;Loads of action so it kept your attention.
I:1982;1196;Iron Man is a funny and enjoyable action/comedy which will delight viewers.
I:1982;1197;on top of the original work by Stan Lee and his creative team at Marvel Comics.
I:1982;1198;this is smart, provocative entertainment that doesn't forget it's also a popcorn flick with plenty of special effects, nonstop action and an unsubtle sense of good versus evil.
I:1982;1199;Stark survives due to the quick.
I:1982;1200;Lots of carnage inevitably ensues, but Stark's miraculous escape sets the stage for the rest of the story.
I:1982;1201;"his military liaison and best friend Lt. Colonel Jim (""Rhodey"") Rhodes
I:1982;1202;with impressive agility, the often underappreciated Downey makes Stark's transformation palpable and brings surprising conviction to a role that must have seemed absurd on paper.
I:1982;1203;Playing the distressed female again after a similar role as Polly Perkins in Kerry Conran'sSky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much more to play here as Pepper Potts, but she makes the most of a mostly observational role and effortlessly delivers some of the film's more amusing lines.

I:1982;1206;This movie started the summer with a BANG, one of my favorite all time comic book movie.
I:1982;1207;Great cast and special effects.
I:1982;1208;This movie has everything lots of action, outstanding special effects and a good story.
I:1982;1209;I highly recommend this movie to anyone, I saw it by mistake and ended up loving this movie.
I:1982;1210;So good to drop in long after the 1st.

I:1982;1213;as most of my generation and the following two, I grew up reading comics.
I:1982;1214;It is a thrill each time a Marvel character is done justice.
I:1982;1215;In spite of today's grand cine.
I:1982;1216;tech, this is a seamless, superbly executed work of art.
I:1982;1217;"This film will show you what ""supporting role"" is supposed to mean."
I:1982;1218;Thanks to this, Downey got offered Sherlock Holmes, and IRON MAN really is his 'comeback'.
I:1982;1219;He reins in Tony Stark's pathos and gives us a strong, determined man who is not afraid to grow.
I:1982;1220;Jeff Bridges' villain shows the opposite side of that coin brilliantly.
I:1982;1221;i loved hearing Paul Bettany's sexy voice as Stark's computer Jervis, and the inventions, gadgetry, even weapons were a fantastic treat.
I:1982;1222;Stan Lee has always been 'political' marching to his own drummer's beat, and this movie reflects that better than any other I've seen so far.
I:1982;1223;Political can only take you so far: the rest had better be entertaining and just plain good.
I:1982;1224;Now that its sequel is floating around, get and enjoy this unique film.
I:1982;1225;"Samuel L. Jackson gives the perfect ""this."
I:1982;1226;which I can only hope has been delivered as well as this delivered.
I:1982;1227;iRON MAN will be a classic, mark my words.
I:1982;1228;"This might be the most excited I have ever been about a movie since seeing ""Star Wars"" nearly 32 years ago."
I:1982;1229;"Not even ""Lord of the Rings"" got me this stoked (and I love that series)."
I:1982;1230;He really has faith in his audience and it pays off tremendously.
I:1982;1231;We spend the next 3rd of the film watching him transform technically and personally, and it is a joy.
I:1982;1232;We get to laugh at his failures and impulsive behavior, and it is a joy.
I:1982;1233;He starts to save the world, one person at a time and it is spectacular and.
I:1982;1234;Despite the great visual FX and the outstanding action and nearly perfect story, it is the characters that make this film.
I:1982;1235;I have never been a huge fan of any of the actors in this film.
I:1982;1236;I thought his casting as Tony Stark was a good idea before seeing the film.
I:1982;1237;"She brought a huge amount of depth and realism to a fringe character
I:1982;1238;The rest of the characters/actors were equally believable and performed above my expectations.
I:1982;1239;Again, I think this speaks of masterful direction.
I:1982;1240;"If Marvel keep their focus and stick to what worked so brilliantly in ""Iron Man"" we are all in for a real treat!!"
I:1982;1241;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:1982;1242;I would definitely recommend this movie.
I:1982;1243;This was a good start to what will be some super movies.
I:1982;1244;This is a great movie.
I:1982;1245;He really does a great job in this movie.
I:1982;1246;I can see this series going on for quite a while.
I:1982;1247;I was extremely pleased with the way everything turned out.
I:1982;1248;i received the product in time and it was in pretty good shape when I received it.
I:1982;1249;Being able to expierence the intense and complex graphics in Blu ray makes the movie so much more enjoyable.
I:1982;1250;The special effects were awesome and the plot was great.
I:1982;1251;Robert Downing Jr. was an excellent Tony Stark and I loved Gwenneth Paltrow's character.
I:1982;1252;All the acting was excellent and I'm really happy I bought this movie.
I:1982;1253;I was very happy with the movie over all and how quikly it arrived.
I:1982;1254;Wow, I very much enjoyed this movie, and it arrived intact and on time.
I:1982;1255;Those of you who enjoy Fantasy type of movie this one is deffinitly for you.
I:1982;1256;If you read comic books on these topics then you are so going to enjoy this as well.
I:1982;1257;It keeps buffering and it is a pain .
I:1982;1258;like half way through the movie it stops please credit me or some thing
I:1982;1259;iron Man is my favorite!
I:1982;1260;"If you look at movies for what they're intended to be instead of what you think makes a ""really great"" movie, Iron."
I:1982;1261;man is one of the best of it's ilk.
I:1982;1262;fast paced, incredible effects, a story line with just enough techno.
I:1982;1263;i love (most of) the Marvel super hero films and have to say this one left me only wanting it to keep going.

I:1982;1267;he returns home and builds a better super suit to fight crime.
I:1982;1268;He gets a super suit and they battle.
I:1982;1269;But I love the cinematography.
I:1982;1270;Hoping I can be as rich and as famous and brilliant as the person behind Iron Man.
I:1982;1271;i love the quirkiness that Robert Downey, Jr. brought to the character and that he's more than just a spoiled genius with unlimited financial resources, he's got a conscience and he's determined to do right in the world.
I:1982;1272;the special effects are great but they don't overpower the storyline, which is a wonderful change of pace because the story can hold its own, even without all of the special Iron Man CGI stuff.
I:1982;1273;the interplay between the two main characters, Trask and Rhodes, is believable and you see how much both men care for and respect each other.
I:1982;1274;this movie was a refreshing and very pleasant surprise, which makes me want to see how the sequel is handled.
I:1982;1275;I cannot recommend this movie enough for the sheer enjoyment of being entertained without being patronized or bombarded with loud explosions and foul language.
I:1982;1276;this is a true gem of a movie.
I:1982;1277;Of course picture and sound were excellent throughout as expected from blu.
I:1982;1278;to begin, this is a fantastic movie.
I:1982;1279;So in my humble opinion this is a truly wonderful movie, having everything I think a truly wonderful movie needs: good plot, decent effects, great acting, and lots of heart.
I:1982;1280;Yes, I was honestly touched by this movie.
I:1982;1281;and that is because what truly got me was the theme.
I:1982;1282;peace thing that got to me.
I:1982;1283;and this is doubled by the change of heart for lead character Tony Stark.
I:1982;1284;so this theme leads into a delightfully action.y storyline that is simple enough to carry itself through without being brain.
I:1982;1285;"A great blend of humanity mixed with a definite ""fun"" feel."
I:1982;1286;There isnt much that I like in the Marvel Universe, but Ironman is definitely the top spot for me, and its all due to this movie!
I:1982;1287;I think Robert Downey was the perfect choice for Tony Stark, and John Favreau did a great job directing.
I:1982;1288;I never read comic book ONE with a marvel title, so the idea of creating these films is to attract people like myself, as well as quell the fans.
I:1982;1289;I think this film did both very well.
I:1982;1290;as far as the product itself, it has a great amount of extras!
I:1982;1291;an excellent rendition of a comicbook with a surprisingly good performance by Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;1292;it was a rollicking good action flick.
I:1982;1293;jock) and a beautiful love interest.
I:1982;1294;All of this executed very competently, and well acted.
I:1982;1295;Like the watch, the movie had an excellent mechanism in terms of plot and production values.
I:1982;1296;still, the movie was very enjoyable.
I:1982;1297;really good first ironman movie from marvel .
I:1982;1298;as usual prove to be one of the best!
I:1982;1299;I was super impressed on how fast this movie made it to my house.
I:1982;1300;So with his new and improved version of the suit that helped his escape, he's gonna beat them at their own game and find his superhero within.
I:1982;1301;let's state one thing:this is a GREAT cast.
I:1982;1302;driven comicial flair, he was born to play this role.
I:1982;1303;Even the supporting cast of Jeff Bridges (who with his shaven head and beard might be hard to recognize), Terrence Howard, and a surprisingly Gwyneth Paltrow, who you'd figure would do a role like this in the early stages of her career not the opposite, bring the story along with a great pace.
I:1982;1304;As for the CGI effects, of which most times I personally dread, they come off very natural and believable here.
I:1982;1305;Where as in 2008's The Incredible Hulk when the lead character was of organic origin, Iron Man is pure solid.
I:1982;1306;Visually all parties pulled off an amazing feat with Iron Man and honestly without flesh and blood to get in the way, the CGI does what at this point it can truly do best.
I:1982;1307;four minutes of extended and deleted scenes which at least half of are worthy of a director's cut.
I:1982;1308;While a commentary by Downey would have been nice (neither version has one), there still is plenty to enjoy with this presentation.
I:1982;1309;Great cast, great story, and a bonus ending scene (featuring a surprising cameo) that will make you demand more in the near future.
I:1982;1310;I loved the film, and saw it twice at the theatre.
I:1982;1311;Downey was a surprise casting decision for me, but it works perfectly.
I:1982;1312;the film succeeds better than most comic book adaptations by not trying too hard to be cool.
I:1982;1313;There is a realism in the narrative that is subtle, but effective.
I:1982;1314;BUT it's AWESOME from start to finish.
I:1982;1315;One that you can watch over and over and it will never get old.
I:1982;1316;Being a huge fan of this super hero I had to have the movie and I wanted nothing less then the best so I got this blu ray two disc edition.
I:1982;1317;I got it used and it was flawless.
I:1982;1318;What a great time to be a geek.
I:1982;1319;A smart, rich guy becomes a superhero in this adaptation of the classic comic book character.
I:1982;1320;this movie was made to entertain and it does without caring about art or any other non.
I:1982;1321;The acting, plot, and story is top.
I:1982;1322;Hit n git entertainment defined.
I:1982;1323;I will continue to do this and only swap it for Iron Man 2.
I:1982;1324;you just have to watch this movie it is the best and it keep on getting better and better cant wait till the second movie
I:1982;1325;"I then said, ""I've got to see this one now!"
I:1982;1326;While it isn't an Oscar winner, it is definitely for action lovers and comic fans!
I:1982;1327;terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow do a great job as their respective characters.
I:1982;1328;I've personally never thought of Paltrow as hot but she did change my mind with the shape she got herself in for this film!
I:1982;1329;When I saw Ironman for first time I thought, this is a movie any supeheroe fan must own, now that I own it I confirm that, great movie, excellent effects and what can I say about Robert Downey, Jeff Bridges, Wyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard, they are great actors.
I:1982;1330;"First, we enjoyed it by ourselves
I:1982;1331;Tony Stark is a brilliant individual who graduates from MIT at an early age and goes on to design many of the weapons sold by the company his father founded.
I:1982;1332;"The pace is amazing as we confront terrorists who to Stark's horror and dismay
I:1982;1333;How is this possible if he only sells to friends?Stark is captured and transforms into Iron Man by a suit he designs that makes him indestructible, with weapons to fight innumerable enemies and able to fly to safety.
I:1982;1334;"It is fun to watch Stark tell her ""the vacation is over"" and that the first thing he MUST do is eat a cheeseburger."
I:1982;1335;the technology used in this movie is razor edge, his ability to design in a three dimensional environment is simply awesome.
I:1982;1336;This movie provided adventure, romance, intrigue and comedy.
I:1982;1337;This movie is awesome, really entertaining.
I:1982;1338;i would recommend this movie to all superhero lovers.
I:1982;1339;Good price too, always great deals.
I:1982;1340;That, of course, could easily lead to a super.
I:1982;1341;hero comparison via the eye.
I:1982;1342;fast paced action, sure .
I:1982;1343;Sad, because I was still enjoying it.
I:1982;1344;downey was spectacular as the nascent superhero, developing the new suit.
I:1982;1345;Childish, yet thoroughly amusing consequences (several squashed cars).
I:1982;1346;Nothing else is really that spectacular, but you don't notice being so engrossed with him.
I:1982;1347;elizabeth's rating: 2The special effects are better on the big screen
I:1982;1348;Next to The Avengers, Batman Begins, Man of Steel, and X. men: First Class, Iron Man is and probably will be the greatest superhero movie franchise in history.
I:1982;1349;Watch and you'll know why.
I:1982;1350;Very strong movie that stands up there with the original Batman with Michael Keaton and the original Spider.
I:1982;1351;Good modern adaptation of the story.
I:1982;1352;They'll have to get creative with SHEILD for the sequel to work.
I:1982;1353;almost any movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it has to be good right?
I:1982;1354;well this is again the case.
I:1982;1355;The first is the best in the trilogy closely followed by the third.
I:1982;1356;it was a gift so i uess it was fine.
I:1982;1357;The price was good and he was happy
I:1982;1358;in addition to the stand out performance by Mr. Downey, Jon Favreau's direction is slick, sharp and fast.
I:1982;1359;The script is intelligent and fun.
I:1982;1360;This one is one of the best of this genre!
I:1982;1361;I bought this item for my cousin for Christmas.
I:1982;1362;we enjoyed watching this as a family.
I:1982;1363;Thank YouI got it in 2days like said.
I:1982;1364;If Harry Potter can do it, you can do it better!
I:1982;1365;Interesting and full of action.
I:1982;1366;There was a lot of creativity used to make the movie and it was well done.
I:1982;1367;He is joking with some members of a convoy who seem to be genuinely amused by his persona.
I:1982;1368;Tony is captured and recorded by a group of terrorists.
I:1982;1369;hand man (and his father's former partner) Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) accepts the award in Tony's honor.
I:1982;1370;After the demonstration, Tony gets a phone call from Obadiah and they are both pleased that the demonstration went well.
I:1982;1371;His chest is hooked up to a strange device.
I:1982;1372;Yinsen created a device .
I:1982;1373;With Yinsen's help, Tony constructs a tiny version of an arc reactor, streamlined from a much bigger design used at his company's headquarters.
I:1982;1374;Raza gives them one more day to finish.
I:1982;1375;tony, fully powered, muscles his way through the cave.
I:1982;1376;Tony tearfully thanks Yinsen for saving him.
I:1982;1377;He destroys their stockpile of weapons and uses a rudimentary jet.
I:1982;1378;Rhody is overjoyed to find that his friend is alive.
I:1982;1379;tony comes to visit Rhodes and asks for help with a new private project.
I:1982;1380;tony turns to his other best friend .
I:1982;1381;tony decides that the first thing he has to do is to perfect the armor's flight system.
I:1982;1382;Pepper comes in when he is testing the stabilizers and they find that it also creates a powerful repulsion beam that could also be used as a weapon.
I:1982;1383;tony finally manages to perfect his flight system, and is delighted at the prospect of flying.
I:1982;1384;"Tony also instructs Jarvis to add some ""hot."
I:1982;1385;Tony then leaves to dance with Pepper and they share a moment together in the moonlight.
I:1982;1386;When the new suit is completed, Stark steps in and essentially transforms into Iron Man for the first time, determined to right his company's wrongs.
I:1982;1387;He leaves the group's leader alive and defenseless for the villagers to take their revenge on.
I:1982;1388;He succeeds in destroying his missiles and taking out most of the terrorists.
I:1982;1389;during the fight, CENTCOM detects the unknown agent.
I:1982;1390;"Tony calls Rhodes and reveals that he is responsible for the ""unidentified craft."""
I:1982;1391;Iron Man, still under fire, manages to fly in and successfully deploy the parachute in time to save the pilot's life.
I:1982;1392;Pepper is moved by Tony's dedication, and agrees.
I:1982;1393;She goes into Obadiah's office with a tiny piece of equipment designed to copy files from the computer.
I:1982;1394;obadiah meets with his team of developers working on his own armored suit.
I:1982;1395;Obadiah yanks out the power source from Tony's heart, taunting him all the while.
I:1982;1396;He gets the power source installed just as Rhody arrives.
I:1982;1397;They spot the Mark 1 Armor and a storage location where something else was kept.
I:1982;1398;tony instructs Pepper to overload the building's arc reactor, which will generate a shockwave strong enough to knock out the Iron Monger's suit.
I:1982;1399;Tony manages to keep fighting while she builds up power to the reactor.
I:1982;1400;Stark's original mini arc reactor sparks back to life, allowing Tony to survive.
I:1982;1401;days later, Rhody holds a press conference about the incident with the two robots.
I:1982;1402;"Tony is impressed with the newspapers coming up with the name ""Iron Man,"" and plans to adopt it."
I:1982;1403;He turns around and introduces himself.
I:1982;1404;He's come to talk with Tony Stark about an upcoming project.
I:1982;1405;This has to be one of the best movies ever.
I:1982;1406;ray makes it even better.
I:1982;1407;It looks gorgeous (DLP) and sounds incredible (7.1 SS).
I:1982;1408;love home iron, the first 2 films were exelente and waiting for the May 3 for the third film, thanks for the good service and recommend it to everyone, thank you very much
I:1982;1409;Jeff Bridges makes a great Obidiah Stane and Gwenyth Paltrow is okay as Pepper Potts.
I:1982;1410;Downey Jr was born to play Tony Stark/Iron man.
I:1982;1411;Robert Downey Jr potrays the character Tony Stark perfectly.
I:1982;1412;This movie is fun and action packed, if you like RDJr then you'll love this movie.
I:1982;1413;"Even Though It Has Been Said That Iron Man Did Not In Many Ways Stay True To The Comics It Is Still An Entertaining ""Marvel""."
I:1982;1414;Be it his over the top public persona, or his reinvention after his abduction by terrorists, or his more comedic moments, RDJ brings Stark out of the comic page and imbues him with enough of himself that an audience is willing to take flight when he finally dons the armor.
I:1982;1415;RDJ is ably assisted by his strong willed girl friday, Pepper Potts, enjoyably played by Gwyneth Paltrow.
I:1982;1416;As well as his military liaison and friend James Rhodes, here played by Terrence Howard.
I:1982;1417;The movie isn't perfect, but is still great, Iron Man always entertains.
I:1982;1418;Action throughout with a story line that continued to the end.
I:1982;1419;was the absolute true representation of a hero's outfit as portrayed in the comic.
I:1982;1420;I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man.
I:1982;1421;And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good.
I:1982;1422;Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.
I:1982;1423;Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it.
I:1982;1424;She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking.
I:1982;1425;developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen.
I:1982;1426;He was just a very likable guy.
I:1982;1427;villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie.
I:1982;1428;Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over.
I:1982;1429;And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.
I:1982;1430;I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.
I:1982;1431;Totally iconic, and perfect in every way.
I:1982;1432;I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp.
I:1982;1433;overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner.
I:1982;1434;ray value, it's a must.
I:1982;1435;By the way, that is also a very good movie that is full of nuance.
I:1982;1436;That being said, this movie well made the grade for such an endeavor.
I:1982;1437;the storyline is tight, well told, well paced and well acted.
I:1982;1438;about the only complaint that I can make has to do with the sound.
I:1982;1439;I found myself using close.
I:1982;1440;What the heck are the producers thinking when they know that great technology is at their fingertips.
I:1982;1441;If you are going to see the avengers this year then you must see this movie since it is an integral part of that storyline.
I:1982;1442;Experiencing IRONMAN in the theatre was breathtaking, unbelievable, and larger than life.
I:1982;1443;experience that magical event until NOW.
I:1982;1444;Totally awesome movie and background information.
I:1982;1445;great looking scenes, fun dialog, and terrorists who are actually into terror for terror's sake, not some obvious political or regional cause.
I:1982;1446;This is a great movie!
I:1982;1447;It arrived very quickly and in excellent condition.
I:1982;1448;Ordering from Amazon is definitely the way to go.
I:1982;1449;What was enjoyable about Iron Man was that it was a smart addition to the Marvel Comics film adaptations.
I:1982;1450;written enough to keep all main characters involved in the climactic and critical scenes.
I:1982;1451;The major characters all did great jobs in their roles: Gweneth Paltrow does a commendable job as Stark's assistant, and Jeff Bridges does an excellent job Stark's company business partner.
I:1982;1452;This movie has a great story line, action and humor at the same time, which is if very hard to do, with this kind of film and this one pulls it off.
I:1982;1453;Robert Downy JR. is very fun to watch in the most recent productions.
I:1982;1454;What I liked best about this movie was not everyone spoke English.
I:1982;1455;Needless to say, Downey escapes and gets back to the United States.
I:1982;1456;downey is so smart, he can build robotry control circuits from scratch like he's making pasta.
I:1982;1457;In the film he is engaged by two jet fighters, but flies faster and smarter.
I:1982;1458;Kids will love it because kids believe anything.
I:1982;1459;"The movie technicians did a great job assembling parts
I:1982;1460;The blue ray presentation is and excellent option for this kind of movies (special fx/action).
I:1982;1461;This movie is one of the best movies of super.
I:1982;1462;hero I have ever seen.
I:1982;1463;He gets into the hummer, doesn't let his buddy in, saying this is the fun vehicle.
I:1982;1464;In the movie, he talks with the soldiers and drinks.
I:1982;1465;very exciting, need to have watched the previous super heros movies to know or remember who some of the other charactors are.
I:1982;1466;"I thought, ""Yeah, right"" and that it would be another boring comic book movie."
I:1982;1467;R. d. Jr. is terrific in the lead.
I:1982;1468;this flick has action, romance and humor.
I:1982;1469;I bought this for myself to go with Iron Man One .
I:1982;1470;This is a great film to start the marvel cinematic universe and one of the best marvel films.
I:1982;1471;Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, amazed at the concepts behind the making of the suit, special effects made it realisticlly possible.
I:1982;1472;While the movie was not boring, but wasn't surely the best I saw.
I:1982;1473;I wanted to see this before I see Iron Man 3, so my feedback is based on viewing this in 2013 as opposed to when this was released
I:1982;1474;Awesome movie and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect for the role.
I:1982;1475;jeff Bridges is awesome as the heavy.
I:1982;1476;My son got me started in this type of movies and so far it has been injoyable.
I:1982;1477;This is a fine movie, excellent special effects, enjoyable and top notch actors, and a patriotic story.
I:1982;1478;I'm a big marvel fan and decided to collect all the movies.
I:1982;1479;Gave to my nephew for Christmas present and he loved the movie.
I:1982;1480;The package was well package and the items arrived on time.
I:1982;1481;Thanks for a job well done.
I:1982;1482;Enjoyed the movie graphics and effects are great.
I:1982;1483;Still love a human superhero.
I:1982;1484;We got this movie for our oldest son and became a family favorite.
I:1982;1485;The movie itself is fantastic, but the disc could use some work.
I:1982;1486;If you wait long enough, it will clear and you will be able to play the movie.
I:1982;1487;The action is pretty consistant throughout.
I:1982;1488;The fact that such a brilliant persona counldn't see what was going on under his very nose was probably the crucial element for me.
I:1982;1489;overall, acting reasonable, reflection on truth, very close.
I:1982;1490;What a hoot, so fun, not a big super hero fan, but this had me laughing and loving Downey and Gwyneth.
I:1982;1491;I have seen a lot of superhero films in my life and I usually find that the acting is second.
I:1982;1492;rate and the endings are irritatingly open.
I:1982;1493;I'm now glad that I did, because it is a surprisingly good film.
I:1982;1494;"i have always considered Robert Downey Jr. to be an excellent actor (I still think he should have won the Best Actor Oscar for ""Chaplin"") and his performance in ""Iron Man"" is no exception."
I:1982;1495;Downey turns in one of his best performances in years and is ably supported by Jeff Bridges as the film's villain.
I:1982;1496;Furthermore, the film's ending provides enough closure so that this film can stand by itself without sequels (although, I am certain that the film's makers would be more than happy to continue the franchise).
I:1982;1497;the film's script is filled with the sort of light.
I:1982;1498;overall, this film is definitely worth your time and money.
I:1982;1499;"Iron Man is targeted at a more mature audience than films such as ""Spiderman"" or ""X. men"", but it still should appeal to viewers of all ages."
I:1982;1500;And if you do go and see it, make sure you stay until the end of the credits.
I:1982;1501;Although the credits are very long, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, those who do sit through them are rewarded by an extra scene at the end of them, which is definitely worth the wait.
I:1982;1502;This movie is definitely collectable.
I:1982;1503;No matter the story or actor are excellent.
I:1982;1504;This has got to be one of the greatest movies created.
I:1982;1505;This movie is almost perfect.
I:1982;1506;It has awesome action scenes, a great number of laughs, and parts that make you sad.
I:1982;1507;Robert Downey Jr. plays his part perfectly in Iron Man.
I:1982;1508;Since I like this movie series its actually nice to get the additional content .
I:1982;1509;The extras are very good and a lot, specialy if you have BD Live.
I:1982;1510;"I have never been a comic book guy, and super hero movies are seldom high on my ""I got to see that"" list."
I:1982;1511;"in any case I watched it by myself first because my wife is really not a ""Comic Book GUY"" but I thought it was so good I asked her to watch it, and surprisingly she enjoyed it as well."
I:1982;1512;So why does a comic book work as a movie?
I:1982;1513;It is an interesting story about a life changing epiphany, and how the things you want, may not be the ones you need or love.
I:1982;1514;It is an interesting story about the futility of bargaining with evil.
I:1982;1515;Iron man is a fun movie with wonderful CG's a very cool visual experience.
I:1982;1516;So, leave your disbelief at the door, and enjoy this very fun ride of a movie!
I:1982;1517;this movie was so cool in the movies and is still cool at home as well.
I:1982;1518;It was not just a comic book but it developed the characters as well as the pop in action.
I:1982;1519;I enjoyed this movie as it was 2 hours of action with bits of comedy.
I:1982;1520;I really enjoyed the movie.
I:1982;1521;It was a great movie and very creative.
I:1982;1522;Robert Downy Jr. does a fantastic job as Iron Man.
I:1982;1523;saw the second showing @ a local movie.
I:1982;1524;me well Iron Man always wasone of my fav.
I:1982;1525;but I enjoyed it more then I thought i whould.
I:1982;1526;for Marvel Hero movies this is up there with Spidy1.
I:1982;1527;though quite bulky and rough it aids him quite well in his escape& rescue.
I:1982;1528;downey is perfect for the part.
I:1982;1529;well some parts get a little wordy but thats okay ,the climatic fight well average for this type of movie,the real let down is Starks final sentce.
I:1982;1530;Good Flic, adds to my series.
I:1982;1531;I hope to see another one come out.
I:1982;1532;This is just one of those action movies you can watch over and over again.
I:1982;1533;Super entertainment for all ages.
I:1982;1534;old son really enjoyed it.
I:1982;1535;We loved the good guy wins theme, and the action!
I:1982;1536;Great movie if you like the comic book stuff.
I:1982;1537;Downey is great as this role.
I:1982;1538;One of the best movies the summer of 08 gave us!
I:1982;1539;Robert Downey Jr. has made an amazing come back to films.
I:1982;1540;Jon Favreau has brought the armored avanger to life!
I:1982;1541;The sequel will hopefully be just as amazing!
I:1982;1542;Robert Downey Jr. is incredible.
I:1982;1543;He seems to get better with each film he makes.
I:1982;1544;He makes Iron Man and true to life hero despite the implausibility of it all.
I:1982;1545;He literally gives this character heart (no pun intended).
I:1982;1546;IRON MAN is a thoroughly entertaining film thanks to a great script and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance.
I:1982;1547;I was totally surprised how good this film was.
I:1982;1548;This is one you just have to see.
I:1982;1549;It entertains but works on such an emotional level and that's what really makes it work.
I:1982;1550;Downey is great for the part of an arrogant playboy genius who creates a suit of iron to save the world.
I:1982;1551;of comic bookish masterpiece, did his homework for Iron Man and created a story of technological evolution interwoven with the marketplace of tech, its true battleground, and its protagonist : Tony Stark.
I:1982;1552;"The movie captures the magic of the early 80s marvel comic run ""Demon in a Bottle,"" that was a contribution to the comic book renaissance."
I:1982;1553;And, like the movie Superman, it brings vividly detailed story elements that bring additional depth to the Iron man phenom as translated onto the silver screen.
I:1982;1554;The creative team is also having fun all along, just like all great Marvel comics characters did, along their fantastic journeys.
I:1982;1555;Now this was a great movie, they did an awesome job with it and everyone I know enjoyed watching this movie.
I:1982;1556;I just wanted to say Yo Dude spend for a better TV, Full screen cuts the original format and you are only seeing part of the film.
I:1982;1557;The acting was great and Robert Downey Jr looks just like Stark in the comics.
I:1982;1558;The suit is awesome and the special effects added nicely to the movie to help complement the scenes.
I:1982;1559;This movie is worth it.
I:1982;1560;If you liked the comics then you should like this movie.
I:1982;1561;Just sit back an enjoy.
I:1982;1562;This movie was great in the theater and just as good on blu ray.
I:1982;1563;It is nice that they are turning classic comic series into feature films.
I:1982;1564;The movie had a great pace to it.
I:1982;1565;Robert Downy Jr. played the part to perfection.
I:1982;1566;jeff Bridges is always great but I didn't recognize him since he's put on weight.
I:1982;1567;i highly recommend this movie, I've seen it several times and I hardly ever see a movie more than once.
I:1982;1568;Iron Man the movie is not only a great adaptation of the comic hero but is a great movie in general.
I:1982;1569;It has it all: Special effects, great acting, interesting, realistic characters and a very modern story.
I:1982;1570;(Spoilers)The comic of course was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry Lieber, and Don Heck.
I:1982;1571;the film follows the comic book very well (with a couple of alterations such as it taking place in the West Coast instead of the East Coast for example).
I:1982;1572;man, The Hulk and other comic book heroes there isn't a mutant or radioactive, gamma force that gives the hero his power, the power lies in the man's own ability to use his intellect, wits, bravery and judgment to combat the villains and problems he encounters.
I:1982;1573;Yinsen (another prisoner) is the man who has kept Stark alive and helps create the prototype of Iron Man with him.
I:1982;1574;This leads to an impressive special effects action sequence that led to a lot of clapping and cheering with the audience I saw it with.
I:1982;1575;His business partner Obadiah Stone does not share Stark's new vision and this leads to several dramatic scenes and more superb special effects with Iron Man.
I:1982;1576;What a smart guy he is.
I:1982;1577;Jon is a good director but this was by far his biggest project.
I:1982;1578;Jeff Bridges was great and Gwyneth Paltrow were also very good.
I:1982;1579;again going back to why this movie is so successful: It's not dumb down, we got a moral dilemma with a guy coming to grips over the destruction that comes from his business but is starting to correct it, we got several shots at the corporate culture putting profit ahead of lives, we get a nice romantic storyline here, we have multidimensional characters, and lastly we got great special effects.
I:1982;1580;On top of all this we have a good attempt to follow the comic book hero.
I:1982;1581;Robert is great in this as usualand this 2.
I:1982;1582;disc set has nice picture and sound plusneat extras.
I:1982;1583;I recommend this good comic book film.
I:1982;1584;But given it WAS the final 8 minutes and given the genius of the rest of the movie (look quickly and you'll see Captain America's shield in Stark's workshop about 2/3rds through the movie!
I:1982;1585;uSA Paltrow in real life but they nailed the parts well, and like most of Angelina Jolie movies, they're better people in their movies than in real life.
I:1982;1586;Just flawless really and we don't hesitate to forgive the final 8 mins of stilted CGI action!!!
I:1982;1587;Love the humorous dialogue throughout the movie by Robert Downey, Jr.
I:1982;1588;Outstanding story, first rate acting.
I:1982;1589;It's a watch 'more than once' movie for sure.
I:1982;1590;There are plenty of special features in high definition on the second disc, including detailed renderings of Iron Man's armor for the artistically curious.
I:1982;1591;First of all, I loved IRON MAN as a kid in the comic books.
I:1982;1592;I never expect a superhero movie to be true to the comic.
I:1982;1593;This movie delivers all of those things.
I:1982;1594;In all of this he grows as a person.
I:1982;1595;I recommend watching this movie.
I:1982;1596;I enjoy watching it over again, just like the first time.
I:1982;1597;Despite all of the products placed in this movie, Iron Man is actually really good.
I:1982;1598;The technology is crazy cool, action is on the money, and the story is tight.
I:1982;1599;Verizon Wireless has the best deals on monthly plans.
I:1982;1600;i am happy that Iron Man did not go the Batman route.
I:1982;1601;Iron Man was funny and serious and action.
I:1982;1602;packed all at the right times.
I:1982;1603;Actors, writers, and filmmakers alike can learn a lot of from Iron Man.
I:1982;1604;its a great movie even my girls loved it.
I:1982;1605;I enjoyed the movie whether it's silly or not.
I:1982;1606;Mr. Downey did an impeccable job of playing the main character, and I am really looking forward to a sequel!!
I:1982;1607;Finally, Marvel Comics' ol' Shellhead arrives on the big screen, and he arrives with stunning force.
I:1982;1608;park special effects to the well.
I:1982;1609;written script, brought to life by a high caliber cast.
I:1982;1610;It's just a good story told very well.
I:1982;1611;And, as a bonus, it's surprisingly funny.
I:1982;1612;Fancy private jet with gorgeous stewardesses doubling as pole dancers.
I:1982;1613;"When asked to justify his company's role as the military's primary weapons provider, his flippant response is ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."
I:1982;1614;A makeshift electromagnetic device (hooked to a car battery) is implanted in his chest cavity, to prevent the shrapnel from piercing his heart.
I:1982;1615;this film is awesome, definitely a fan boy's giddy dream.
I:1982;1616;IRON MAN brings the thunder, delivers the goods.
I:1982;1617;There are so many highlight, pump.you.
I:1982;1618;up moments here, to relish and hoot and holler for.
I:1982;1619;step (and often hilarious) development of the new, sleeker model.
I:1982;1620;The first time the new model goes into action.
I:1982;1621;It's pretty contagious, the sheer fun and enjoyment experienced by Tony as he goes about putting together his armor.
I:1982;1622;On celluloid, he's dynamic and dazzling and oh so friggin' cool!
I:1982;1623;But the thing that really puts it all together, that which makes this flick such a hands down winner and a box office monster, is Robert Downey, Jr.
I:1982;1624;Downey brings his fabulous acting, his jaded charisma and his comic wit and timing to the role.
I:1982;1625;"And to see him breathe life into Tony Stark is to think ""Yes, of course!"""
I:1982;1626;the man fits the part so seamlessly.
I:1982;1627;Still handsome, but there's a well worn look to him now.
I:1982;1628;For an actor who's had his ups and downs and for a brilliant formerly heartless ex.
I:1982;1629;"Very good ""origin"" superhero movie."
I:1982;1630;I bought the first one for obvious reasons and really enjoyed it.
I:1982;1631;So fun to see the Iron Man beginnings and watch him develop into the Tony Stark we all know and love.
I:1982;1632;I'm really huge on comic books turned movies as long as there done the right way, and so I'm glad to give this movie 5 stars and definitely glad to own it on Blu.
I:1982;1633;We saw this in the movies and thought it was a great movie!
I:1982;1634;Watching this movie, Robert Downey Jr does impressive work.
I:1982;1635;very strong movie, some violent parts, but works to help the watcher understand the perils of war and how something you created for good has been placed in the hands of violent people and used for mass destruction.
I:1982;1636;the transformation of a regular guy [type: rich, business, strong, etc] to using his itelligence to create a character that we cheer for and the kids want to become.
I:1982;1637;A doer of 'Good' and always wins in the end.
I:1982;1638;my son will love it.
I:1982;1639;He loves this movie and will be excited.
I:1982;1640;Thank you for the smooth transaction.
I:1982;1641;The effects were probably better on the big screen but the action was fun with witty dialog.
I:1982;1642;Robert Downing plays a great super hero!
I:1982;1643;Overall, a good movie for the entire family.
I:1982;1644;So, I bought it again and I'm happy to say it is just as amazing as I remember.
I:1982;1645;He really enjoyed the film and has thanked us profusely
I:1982;1646;Even the single disc version has a lot of bonus footage.
I:1982;1647;Both me and my 4 year old daughter enjoy it.
I:1982;1648;Robert Downey jr is perfect for the role of tony stark.
I:1982;1649;I never see movies twice in the theater, and I think I'm going to see this one a third time.
I:1982;1650;it's fun, fascinating, adventurous, funny, touching, and the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Gwenyth Paltrow is spellbinding.
I:1982;1651;And Pepper Potts makes a perfect counterbalance.
I:1982;1652;it came on time and speedy and was in excellent condition.
I:1982;1653;was not what i had expected but still a great movie .
I:1982;1654;Everything an action movie should be including a great plot, not just a bunch of action.
I:1982;1655;"I really enjoyed the ""other"" version i watched this move in."
I:1982;1656;It is also Great Movie have watch over and over
I:1982;1657;excellent viewing recommend watching this movie in blu ray format absolutely stunning especially when hooked up to my home theatre system a must see movie
I:1982;1658;Excitement at a great price.
I:1982;1659;Great to make a weekend of all 3.
I:1982;1660;The movie was fast paced and very exciting.
I:1982;1661;Sci Fi can sometimes be confusing, but I loved the mix of the science plus the personal.
I:1982;1662;Daughter enjoyed it and it was for her.
I:1982;1663;And he did a great job with this one.
I:1982;1664;i would have loved it the same.
I:1982;1665;For those of you with kids or who are kids @ heart.
I:1982;1666;This movie is, in a word, superb.
I:1982;1667;This time, they got it absolutely right.
I:1982;1668;The pacing is perfect, the characters are actually developed well, the story is well adapted to the 40+ year Iron Man mythos, and the SFX are used to support the story.
I:1982;1669;Usually it's the other way around, with the effects totally overwhelming the rest of the film in order to please fanboy types and kids who just want eye candy.
I:1982;1670;while the film is generally very serious, there are nice touches of both humor and romance.
I:1982;1671;The supporting characters and actors .
I:1982;1672;Downey's characterization of Stark, and the gravitas he brings to the character once he realizes what his company has been doing with its weapons, is absolutely spot on.
I:1982;1673;Jeff Bridges is perfect as Obadiah .
I:1982;1674;Robert Downey Jr. is great as Iron Man and this is a great movie!
I:1982;1675;I have yet to see Dark Knight yet, but from what I hear, Iron Man is the more positive, feel good side.
I:1982;1676;the best summer movies are ones that wow you with special effects but also have performances that captivate you, and this one has that.
I:1982;1677;"Sometimes a movie is overloaded with star power to draw you in
I:1982;1678;"in the novel ""Moonraker"" by Ian Fleming, the villain told James Bond that if a man is bald and grows a mustache, even his mother wouldn't recognize him."
I:1982;1679;Jeff Bridges proves the point in this movie.
I:1982;1680;The real action is at the beginning and towards the end.
I:1982;1681;(The editorial review loved the ending .
I:1982;1682;there is one thing and one thing alone that makes Iron Man such an enjoyable movie.
I:1982;1683;The script is ok, and Jon Favreau does a pretty decent ass job in the director's chair for it too, but it is Downey that carries the weight of the movie on his metal clad shoulders.
I:1982;1684;downey brings to the table the most enjoyable performance in a popcorn movie since Johnny Depp set sail as Captain Jack Sparrow in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
I:1982;1685;It is an interesting twist on the paradigm of the costumed hero that Stark is more weighed down by the impact on the world he has created as a normal person, albeit a larger than life normal person, than he does as a costumed crusader.
I:1982;1686;His joy in being a superhero reminds us of something often forgotten in many of the overly dark failures in comic book adaptations the last few years, the reason so many little kids want to be superheroes in the first place: it looks kind of fun.
I:1982;1687;I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something.
I:1982;1688;remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free.
I:1982;1689;Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu.
I:1982;1690;Now they would be funny together.
I:1982;1691;I love watching this movie because it's not too violent so my daughter can watch it, and it's got lots of action so my hubby loves it too.
I:1982;1692;We can have a movie night at our house with this movie!
I:1982;1693;Robert Downey, Jr. does about as good a job with the lead character as anyone could, and the acting is pretty good overall, but the special effects are just OK, the plot is somewhat juvenille, and the portrayal of the Afghan bad guys is laughably stereotypical.
I:1982;1694;it is now my favorite movie!I really loved Roberty Downy Jr. in Sherlock Holmes, and he only makes himself more likeable in the Iron Man movies.
I:1982;1695;It's definitely worth a few bucks to own this one!If you like any of the following qualities in a movie, you'll like Iron Man:.
I:1982;1696;"everything else that a good movie has to offer
I:1982;1697;Robert Downey JR is awesome.
I:1982;1698;We bought this primarily for our grandsons, and they love it.
I:1982;1699;I liked it better the first time I saw it.
I:1982;1700;Seriously, kids will definitely like it.
I:1982;1701;You got to admit, it took a lot of dedication and perseverance to come up with a movie like this.
I:1982;1702;I have always been a very big fan of Iron Man.
I:1982;1703;The CGI is this movie is just plain amazing!
I:1982;1704;And the design of the suit baffles the imagination.
I:1982;1705;I simply enjoyed watching him in action, blasting those repulsor rays and flying in the air at supersonic speeds.
I:1982;1706;Disc #2 of this set will further make you appreciate the effort behind the making of this movie.
I:1982;1707;It is just plain amazing!
I:1982;1708;I highly recommend this to all Marvel fans!
I:1982;1709;A very rich, eccentric, smart, and generous owner of a weapons company, Tony Stark, is captured by Moslem terrorists.
I:1982;1710;Who is behind the capture?Tony builds an iron suit of armor with built.
I:1982;1711;throwers and rocket launchers and an ability to fly.
I:1982;1712;Using the suit, he destroys the terrorists and returns to the US determined to give up weapon production and use his genius to help people.
I:1982;1713;He builds an improved suit of armor despite suffering many humorous failures.
I:1982;1714;He uses the suit to fly to the Moslem country where he saves people from the terrorists.
I:1982;1715;Tony's number two man in the weapons company meets with the terrorists, finds out about the iron suit, and builds an improved version of his own.
I:1982;1716;I'm a fan of Marvel comics, have been since I was a kid.
I:1982;1717;I think it's one of the best, out of all the comic.
I:1982;1718;But this movie was great!!!!
I:1982;1719;This is absolutely on my short list of movies I can watch over and over, and I can't wait to do that on my PS3, surround sound and really, really big TV!
I:1982;1720;Excellent movie, great PQ and AQ, no reaching for remote.
I:1982;1721;Colors are accurate throughout, crisp, clear, no blocking or artifacts.
I:1982;1722;Robert Downey Jr. does a great job along with the others cast.
I:1982;1723;The extra's are well worth the price.
I:1982;1724;I highly recommend this edition to the Iron Man fans out there.
I:1982;1725;This is a great and funny movie robet downing jr. is a real good actor and he does it once again.
I:1982;1726;This is a very well made movie and the special effects are great.
I:1982;1727;Iron man is an excellent comic book movie and action adventure film.
I:1982;1728;tony Stark(robert downey jr.) is a rocket scientist,industrialist,billionaire,visionary,genius and very effective communicator.
I:1982;1729;rocket scientists are the smartest people in the world and engineering is rocket science.
I:1982;1730;the Iron Man suit is a masterpiece of technology and engineering and is a 100 times stronger than steel or diamond and is powered by a nuclear core and the nuclear energy of the arc.
I:1982;1731;iron Man is an excellent,wonderfull and very entertaining movie.
I:1982;1732;iron man is stylish,very cool,amazing,phenomenal and beyond wonder.
I:1982;1733;His military liason and best freind Col. Robert Rhodes is along for the ride to meet the general.
I:1982;1734;All goes well and the ride back is attacked by unkown forces.
I:1982;1735;Thus Iron Man is born and starts off by freeing himself and the good doctor.

I:1982;1737;Among the greatest superhero movies every made.
I:1982;1738;Balancing the character driven elements seamlessly with the action, often accomplishing both at the same time.
I:1982;1739;Masterful storytelling, solid writing, and an assortment of fine actors to round it all out.
I:1982;1740;An equal mix of drama and action to keep your attention throughout the entire movie.
I:1982;1741;My son loved this set.
I:1982;1742;This set is great for ironman fans everywhere .
I:1982;1743;Not big on giving reviews, just found this movie entertaining, which is what a movie should do.
I:1982;1744;next to the Batman film (Dark Knight), Iron Man was by far the most enjoyable action film of summer '08.
I:1982;1745;Great cast, great script, interesting CGI, well.
I:1982;1746;downey Jr. adds just the right touch of humor/anger in the role, and Paltrow has never looked more beautiful.
I:1982;1747;in my opinion Jon Favreau did a good job, Robert Downey did an excellent job and although I didn't agree at first, Jeff Bridges did an excellent job as well.
I:1982;1748;Iron man, marvel comics, Robert Downy jr is great as superhero.
I:1982;1749;great movie lots of action.
I:1982;1750;The purest of comic book movies, who has a message, but does not overburden the audience with to much emotional baggage.
I:1982;1751;She is vulnerable, yet ready to take control of any situation that is bestowed on her with total competence.
I:1982;1752;"These three actors make ""Iron Man,"" sturdily solid, great popcorn entertainment for those who want to escape for a couple of hours in their lives!Recommended to everyone who loves a thrill ride of a film, with a great confrontational finale!"
I:1982;1753;disc One: Special Features: Deleted/Extended Scenes.
I:1982;1754;blooper: Robert Downey Jr. sure can eat a hamburger fast.
I:1982;1755;But Scarlett johansan is great and easy on the eyes.
I:1982;1756;on, since Shell Head popped up in Marvel's pantheon, back in the Sixties and got a chest full of shrapnel in 'Nam.
I:1982;1757;all I can say is, MAN!
I:1982;1758;ray if you've got the machine for it), and ENJOY!
I:1982;1759;I've enjoyed the Iron Man series and can't wait until they do more.
I:1982;1760;There was a lot of action, and a good story.
I:1982;1761;A fast moving movie, with a little romance.
I:1982;1762;The acting was great, and I enjoyed it a lot.
I:1982;1763;My husband and both boys love it now, and I think it's my favorite action movie, and certainly my favorite superhero movie (because I don't like any other superhero movies).
I:1982;1764;This is a fast, clever movie that is by turns seriously moving and laugh.
I:1982;1765;I totally bought Downey as the smart.
I:1982;1766;alec (I'm using the nice word) savant with a weakness for women and cars but a sincere desire to do the right thing.
I:1982;1767;I just love this movie!
I:1982;1768;This is a good movie.
I:1982;1769;The main character is a great actor.
I:1982;1770;It is an awesome movie for boys.
I:1982;1771;This was excellent: action packed from beginning to endall actors portrayed their characters wonderfullythe end tied in nicely for Iron Man 2!
I:1982;1772;seen the movies and enjoyed).
I:1982;1773;My son encouraged me to see the movie, said i'd like it.
I:1982;1774;Well, I did and i did!
I:1982;1775;It held my interest from the very beginning, right to the end.
I:1982;1776;lots of exciting action etc etc.
I:1982;1777;Just plain enjoyable and total escapism.
I:1982;1778;But I'd have bought this title regardless.
I:1982;1779;hero movies, but watched this one after my kids (ages 14 and 12) watched it on their Air France flight and loved it themselves.
I:1982;1780;Perhaps because the story of Iron Man as told in the comic books has more pragmatic beginnings, this movie is believable.
I:1982;1781;Excellent acting all around, excellent use of humor.
I:1982;1782;I sure hope the ending suggests a sequel!
I:1982;1783;He makes the whole gamut work .
I:1982;1784;The movie is sprinkled thoroughly with some of the most witty dialog I have heard in a very long time.
I:1982;1785;The SFX are completely amazing, never falling short of suspension of disbelief.
I:1982;1786;Well worth the time spent.
I:1982;1787;Gives you a nice glance at why Ironman is who he is.
I:1982;1788;Robert Downey Jr. has another hit under his movie belt.
I:1982;1789;It's a great family movie.
I:1982;1790;Saw it in the movie theater and thought it was GREAT.
I:1982;1791;Visual and special effects seemed seamless.
I:1982;1792;I give it five stars.
I:1982;1793;Just the proper amount of extras, which I really like.
I:1982;1794;I recommend this to even those who don't think they like comic book characters on the big screen.
I:1982;1795;Cool movie from the start to finish, Love all the action and wild plot.
I:1982;1796;Robert Downey Jr.'s sarcastic character makes for some great laughs.
I:1982;1797;I replayed a few scenes and the sound was great.
I:1982;1798;It's a blockbuster and one of the best comic book movie adaptations ever .
I:1982;1799;it's a fun popcorn flick!
I:1982;1800;and with good reason, Iron Man is a very solid film, a proyect that in paper, in 2007 was secondary to other Marvel franchises, as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4 or X. men.
I:1982;1801;Today, i belive that with SpiderMan, it must be the good looking son in hearts of Marvel Excecutives.
I:1982;1802;Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice as Tony Stark and embodies it with masterful audacity.
I:1982;1803;he embodies the character and elevates it to the real world.
I:1982;1804;i can say that after multiple viewings, Iron Man is a solid, appealing and well excecuted piece of entertaining, but no perfect.
I:1982;1805;realistic and belivable, villain says bye bye to the real context of the movie and says hello to super.
I:1982;1806;anyway, this is a very good movie, and another proof that Comic Book Movies are really what are holding Hollywood Economy in relative order.
I:1982;1807;just see the top ten box.
I:1982;1808;office movies, and count how many are from a genere that were once only for kids and geeks, but in the last 10 or 20 years, it has gained the respect of the most talented filmakers, and specially, of the adult audience all around the world.
I:1982;1809;Not a movie to win best picture or make you think, but a good movie to sit back and enjoy.
I:1982;1810;His ability to treat his character with a balance of tongue.
I:1982;1811;cheek and dark intensity really works well.
I:1982;1812;The chemistry between the main protagonists is electric.
I:1982;1813;All in all a great movie !
I:1982;1814;(If anyone knows any workarounds please share, thank you.
I:1982;1815;This has amazing picture, and it was one of my first Blu.
I:1982;1816;This is a great action movie and well done.
I:1982;1817;Just as good as seeing it in the movies.
I:1982;1818;Really enjoyed this film for the first 90 minutes, until it became a predictable super robot movie.
I:1982;1819;Robert Downey, Jr. is technical whiz Tony Stark, the ne'er.
I:1982;1820;do well scion of a weapons manufacturer.
I:1982;1821;He has a social awakening after being captured by Afghan warriors during a product demo, and decides that his company must change course.
I:1982;1822;One of his first designs is a power suit, propelled by a new source of his own devising.
I:1982;1823;downey is perfect for the job.
I:1982;1824;boy persona are perfect for depicting the driven and hard.
I:1982;1825;He is completely believable with booze or blond in hand.
I:1982;1826;Jeff Bridges is completely believable as Stark's corporate partner, uniting uncleish bonhomie with more sinister motivations.
I:1982;1827;The special effects are terrific, but made believable (and often funny) with scenes of Stark test.
I:1982;1828;A scene (shown in the trailer) of Stark outrunning a couple of stealth fighters is harrowing and plenty exciting.
I:1982;1829;Still, the film is rocket.
I:1982;1830;solid until about the 3/4 mark, when it tumbles securely into the old cliche mismatched superhero battle.
I:1982;1831;a fun ride, with a setup (after 10 minutes of credits) for what promises to be a lame sequel.
I:1982;1832;My husband loved the movie and couldn't wait to own the video of this film.
I:1982;1833;the price was good and the ordering a no brainer.
I:1982;1834;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:1982;1835;I love how Robert Downey Jr. just takes on the persona of the Iron Man.
I:1982;1836;Jeff Bridges Is also brilliant.
I:1982;1837;What ever the role is he always nails it.
I:1982;1838;This is just a great movie.
I:1982;1839;Great job to all of the actors.
I:1982;1840;ray movie I bought for my new system.
I:1982;1841;I loved the movie when I saw it in the theater.
I:1982;1842;I love the story line, action and humor that combine to make this a very enjoyable evening in from of the flat screen!!!
I:1982;1843;top boxes running on demand video without degradation of sound or video.
I:1982;1844;Really cool movie with great actors!
I:1982;1845;The action is intense and the story line is also very good!
I:1982;1846;You will like it, trust me.
I:1982;1847;ray release and possibly delivered a spot of damage to the Blu.
I:1982;1848;ray, set for release on Sept. 30, are enduring an eleventh hour recall from Paramount.
I:1982;1849;Considering Iron Man was one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer, the splashy special effects film is perfect for Blu.
I:1982;1850;Robert Downey Jr. brings the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man to life in this thrilling movie.
I:1982;1851;in the end, Tony discovers that Obadiah has betrayed him and has managed to build his own suit.
I:1982;1852;There is a huge confrontation between Tony and Obadiah, and only one will survive.
I:1982;1853;this is an excellent movie.
I:1982;1854;The special effects are great, and there's even a little comedy thrown in, too.
I:1982;1855;"I've seen each of the ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman"" movies, and I'd rate ""Iron Man"" as the best of the superhero films."
I:1982;1856;This has to be included with the biggest SuperHero movies now.
I:1982;1857;You would think that these would at least become slightly predictable but no, this movie is a totally original Genre movie.
I:1982;1858;go Robert draws your attention to his millionair personality, and he gets away with it because he's a quirky kind of guy.
I:1982;1859;Best movie of the year, and I'm sure it's one of the best reviewed also.
I:1982;1860;It's a fantastic story, with rich characters and the best CGI this year.
I:1982;1861;Now that I think about it a little more, why can't we say that for now, this is an Oscar Worthy performance by big.
I:1982;1862;but you have to face it, they are a great source of material.
I:1982;1863;And they are getting better as a whole.
I:1982;1864;Everyone knows his name, partially thanks to Black Sabbath.
I:1982;1865;Especially when you announce Robert Downey Jr. is going to play Tony Stark, the ambitious, brilliant and self centered billionaire industrialist who becomes the title character.
I:1982;1866;But thankfully he is a great fan of the character himself and choose not to make any great changes.
I:1982;1867;For the most part, he plays Stark brilliantly, but adds his own touch as well.
I:1982;1868;In the comics, Stark is a brilliant playboy, with very little sense of humor.
I:1982;1869;As for Downey's version, he brings wit and a sense of being aloof.
I:1982;1870;It's just what the character needed.
I:1982;1871;"He rebels in his own way
I:1982;1872;He starts working on his own project of creating a suit of armor based around his heart supporting energy source.
I:1982;1873;director Jon Favareau deserves a lot of credit for balancing the serious with the brilliant with the humorist on this one.
I:1982;1874;Iron Man is one of the best Superhero movies ever to be made and Downey makes Stark his most entertaining character to date.
I:1982;1875;Great action movie with intellectual aspects.
I:1982;1876;Good for everyone except young children due to graphic violence.
I:1982;1877;The shipping was fast and it was packaged great.
I:1982;1878;The Iron Man movies are for you!
I:1982;1879;He give the character a soul.
I:1982;1880;Seriously, thanks god for Robert Downey Jr., the actor was brilliant in the movie, after watching the movie i couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the role of Tony stark, the guys was simply brilliant.
I:1982;1881;jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely and brought Comic successfully back to life.
I:1982;1882;As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane.
I:1982;1883;She has some rough moments, and this definitely wasn't her best performance, but she didn't bring down the film by any means.
I:1982;1884;Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend and Clark Gregg as a tight.
I:1982;1885;"so ""Iron Man"" is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not."
I:1982;1886;"This is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies, it's great
I:1982;1887;While I cannot quite go all the way with 5 stars for this film, it's a very strong 4.
I:1982;1888;"going experience for most anyone who likes ""Summer"" films."
I:1982;1889;Downey is spectacular as Tony Stark and has proved to me to be a very capable iconic character actor.
I:1982;1890;(His portrayal of Holmes was great too but that's another review).
I:1982;1891;He makes us love Tony despite the fact that the character's demeanor is meant to not be liked.
I:1982;1892;The graphics are great, the story is strong, and kudos for Gwen Paltrow.
I:1982;1893;She's not the damsel in distress we're all use to, and is the perfect opposite for Downey's role.
I:1982;1894;This is a refreshing new take of a superhero story and has thrown me head first into the whole Marvel universe as a new fan.
I:1982;1895;Strong Cast and just a fun movie to watch.
I:1982;1896;Robert Downey Jr. absolutely owns the role of Tony Stark.
I:1982;1897;I love how witty and funny he is.
I:1982;1898;The movie is just great!
I:1982;1899;Everything Robert Downey Jr. is in is worth watching.
I:1982;1900;It has a good plot with plenty of humor.
I:1982;1901;Iron man is my favorite of the Avengers.
I:1982;1902;Great movie, my only gripe was with the packaging.
I:1982;1903;Like I said, best action hero movie in a long time: humor, not too.
I:1982;1904;corny, great special affects and great acting.
I:1982;1905;Okay, let me just say, that this is the best Marvel Adaptation I have seen since Spiderman 2, and to have it immediately followed by the new Hulk movie just about made this the best year for superhero movies.
I:1982;1906;gritty: Some people, including myself, have questioned the choice of Robert Downey Jr playing Stark.
I:1982;1907;When I saw, ages ago, that he would be the title character, I was kind of surprised.
I:1982;1908;A surprise, I never expect to see her in supporting roles, but in this one she looked good.
I:1982;1909;like I said, definitely the best superhero movie from Marvel that I have seen in a long time.
I:1982;1910;He was very surprised to get this as a gift!!
I:1982;1911;I watched this film three times @ the movies and now watch it on a great Blu.
I:1982;1912;received it on time, plays fine.
I:1982;1913;i would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in this kind of movie.
I:1982;1914;It's fun, action packed with a snippet of romance on the side.
I:1982;1915;A wonderful modern day recast of classic tales of Greek heroes.
I:1982;1916;I bought it, viewed it, and throughly enjoyed it.
I:1982;1917;A welcome addition to my collection.
I:1982;1918;The movie was in fine condition.
I:1982;1919;The movie itself is fine and well done.
I:1982;1920;Its like a Disneyland ride, you see it the first time and its exciting.
I:1982;1921;There was still the playful interaction some readers come to love between Tony and Jarvis.
I:1982;1922;Favreau did an excellent job weaving this story, and making it understandable, even if you aren't into the comics.
I:1982;1923;He is a brilliant director, and did a fantastic job.
I:1982;1924;Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man/Tony Stark.
I:1982;1925;he really IS Tony Stark and its so excellent, he's funny, and charming.
I:1982;1926;"which makes it obvious exactly why Tony Stark is the ladies man he is
I:1982;1927;I hope to see Happy and Pepper together in the next film, and I hope that Tony's alcoholism plays a bigger part in the next film, as its been something he struggled with during the comics.
I:1982;1928;The movie is fast paced, and takes you on an excellent ride.
I:1982;1929;I loved the Dark Knight.
I:1982;1930;Robert Downey Jr. is charming, engaging, funny, as Tony Stark.
I:1982;1931;The movie is fast paced and exciting, the evolution of Ironman well thought out, and believable.
I:1982;1932;all marvel fans should own this one.
I:1982;1933;the movie that really started it all for marvel studios!
I:1982;1934;It has pleanty of laughs while Downey himself is very funny while totally owning the character of Stark.
I:1982;1935;Terrance Howard is in good form as well as Stark's military friend.
I:1982;1936;I also liked a bald Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner.
I:1982;1937;When there is action it's super cool and well done.
I:1982;1938;He's not just funny here but he shows that he can handle playing the heroic type and he does it well.
I:1982;1939;Arrived in excellent condition and was very well packaged.
I:1982;1940;For those with low attention spans, this is the perfect movie to watch.
I:1982;1941;The role of Tony Stark was perfectly casted with Robert Downey Jr. who is satisfyingly hysterical!
I:1982;1942;I'd seen this movie in the theater, and found it to be entertaining.
I:1982;1943;So I bought myself a copy for Christmas!
I:1982;1944;But the story is very interesting and doesn't have any true boring points.
I:1982;1945;"subtle political message in the film that powerful people in the business of making weapons delight in conflict and will create conflict if none exist to maximize their profits and power (""evil war mongering capitalists"" versus patriots with a desire for freedom to triumph over tyranny)."
I:1982;1946;Contrasted with Batman, The Dark Knight, in my opinion a better (albeit disturbing) movie .
I:1982;1947;tony Stark is confronted with the fact that that up close .
I:1982;1948;he manages in a twist of irony to invent a weapon more deadly then anything he's ever created.
I:1982;1949;overall, it's a very good film .
I:1982;1950;good cinematography, special effect, action, acting, and story.
I:1982;1951;I enjoyed Robert Downey Jr. in this movie.
I:1982;1952;I think he played the character very well.
I:1982;1953;Just a nice action packed movie with humor.
I:1982;1954;I enjoyed it, so I bought the next two Iron Man movies and enjoyed them as well.
I:1982;1955;Very action packed and entertaining on all levels.
I:1982;1956;I really recommend this flick!!
I:1982;1957;I had high expectations for this film.
I:1982;1958;Okay, it was a summer movie.
I:1982;1959;She's out of this world, and I would like to have seen more of her.
I:1982;1960;He builds an armored battle.
I:1982;1961;He wants to use his company to make the world a better place.
I:1982;1962;Happy to see Robert Downey back in a role made for him.
I:1982;1963;def is definitely worth the extra cost!
I:1982;1964;Iron Man is a really great movie.
I:1982;1965;Robert Downey Jr. really steals the show with his superb acting job as Tony Stark/Iron Man by being absolutely hilarious all throughout and portraying his character perfectly.
I:1982;1966;The film's soundtrack is also notable, full of electric guitar sound mixed with orchestrated stuff and it sounds great and fits the movie really well.
I:1982;1967;The few action scenes in the movie are really cool, and although the final battle is a little underwhelming, the rest is really fun to watch.
I:1982;1968;There are a lot of great, memorable lines and scenes throughout the movie too, my favorite part is probably when he blows up the tank, man that makes me laugh so hard.
I:1982;1969;Add spectacular visual effects and a promised sequel and you get a movie no superhero film fan should miss, and people outside that category have good reason to enjoy it too.
I:1982;1970;One of the best comic.
I:1982;1971;Robert Downey JR was born to play Tony Stark/Iron Man.
I:1982;1972;Yet, the update is so true to who the characters are that they never lose track of how things should be.
I:1982;1973;once back home Tony goes through a few Iron Man armors which fits in perfectly with his comic book history.
I:1982;1974;I don't say this with a grain of salt, this is one of the best comic book movies ever!
I:1982;1975;It stays very true to the comics but also adds to the characters.
I:1982;1976;It's one of the rare comic book movies that holds up in repeat viewings.
I:1982;1977;This movie is so good (and I was skeptical going in because I always liked Iron Man) that I wonder how they will top it in the sequel.
I:1982;1978;It's going to be fun finding out.
I:1982;1979;Action packed, great special effects, witty and funny.
I:1982;1980;Not a perfect movie, but even during one particular shake.
I:1982;1981;I love the imagination that went into making this movie.
I:1982;1982;The story is clever, the characters are well known, and the way they are fleshed out was quite satisfying.
I:1982;1983;The second movie was not as good in my opinion, but this movie is worth the watch.
I:1982;1984;Sticks to the original story pretty well.
I:1982;1985;Robert Downy Jr. makes the movie though with his excellent acting.
I:1982;1986;I completely enjoyed the experience.
I:1982;1987;Overall, I enjoyed this movie alot.
I:1982;1988;The special effects were good as was the action, and it had many genuinely funny moments.
I:1982;1989;The actors lift this and make it fly.
I:1982;1990;As with all the great comicbook movies, it's not the fx, it's the heart.
I:1982;1991;This is a fun one.
I:1982;1992;"The menus are based on the computer system of the movie, so you ""feel"" like your are part of the fun."
I:1982;1993;I highly recommend if you can play blu.
I:1982;1994;I thought it was the best comic book movie yet and I read a gazilion comics growing up in the 60's.
I:1982;1995;Oh well this movie did not try to put all the artsie fartsie stuff like the first Hulk and the third and embarressing Spiderman did.
I:1982;1996;Downey was excellent and looks perfect in the part.
I:1982;1997;By far the best Marvel comic hero movie yet.
I:1982;1998;The purpose of movies is to escape this present for a place and a time when the good guys win and have fun doing it.
I:1982;1999;Sort of like the James Bond franchise.
I:1982;2000;He is the best thing about this movie.
I:1982;2001;tony Stark is a boy genius, smarter than everyone else and heir to a fabulous weapons producing empire.
I:1982;2002;He manages to get captured while on a visit to Afganistan by terrorist.
I:1982;2003;He returns home a changed man and has a revelation to change the world.
I:1982;2004;Bought this for my son.
I:1982;2005;He and I enjoyed watching this together.
I:1982;2006;Good movie on all levels, but still a leftwing view of the U. s. military, and in that sense disappointing.
I:1982;2007;Humor, special effects, good acting, good story line, everything you could want.
I:1982;2008;Looked and sounded great on my modest home entertain equipment.
I:1982;2009;You can just sit back and enjoy.
I:1982;2010;it's all right there for you to just enjoy!
I:1982;2011;"While I'll admit that I haven't been a fan of Marvel Comics ""Iron Man"" series, this big screen adaptation of this fan favorite is absolutely sensational."
I:1982;2012;Indeed, it is quite simply the best cinematic adaptation of a comic book character I have seen so far.
I:1982;2013;Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best screen performances as billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, whose near.
I:1982;2014;The supporting cast is just as superb, most notably Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's lovely .
I:1982;2015;Director Jon Favreau does a fine job handling both the intense, often bloody, action sequences and the more introspective scenes featuring Downey and Paltrow.
I:1982;2016;Of course the special effects are absolutely top notch, courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic.
I:1982;2017;billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) is the owner of a successful weapons industry.
I:1982;2018;Instead he uses his brilliant brains and creates a special armour.
I:1982;2019;"Thus Stark creates a more advanced, industructable and more powerful suit that makes him into ""Iron Man"" in which he serves to protect the innocent and fight evil."
I:1982;2020;intelligent, exciting and thrilling sci.
I:1982;2021;"fi actioner is based on a Marvel Comic Book and is the first great comic book movie of the year next to ""Dark Knight""."
I:1982;2022;Jeff Bridges made a belivable and excellent villain here in this motion picture, the special effects by ILM and Stan Winston are just outstanding including the acting.
I:1982;2023;It stays true to the origins of the comic books even though a little of the origin is changed to a modern time, it's a truly satisfying and smart superhero movie that knows how to please the audience and critics alike thanks to the magic of it's smart script, great acting and fantastic action sequences with a nifty suprise at the end of the credits of this movie.
I:1982;2024;ray is mindblowingly fantastic with it's nicely detailed picture and sound that will blow you away.
I:1982;2025;I remember the original comic from long ago and even though they make this story more contemporary, it's still every bit as good (if not better) than that comic.
I:1982;2026;The Marvel Comics franchise continues to deliver Great movies, like this one.
I:1982;2027;Great casting and special effects, a true pleasure to watch!
I:1982;2028;But with Iron Man, they got it almost perfect.
I:1982;2029;Even my wife, who doesn't necessarily like superhero movies, thoroughly enjoyed this one.
I:1982;2030;man and do it justice for the next few installments!
I:1982;2031;Owning this good adventure movie is so much better than the hassles and expenses of going to a local theater
I:1982;2032;I thought the movie was very good.
I:1982;2033;catch the clever dialogue and the visuals are just wonderful .
I:1982;2034;Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely perfect for this role.
I:1982;2035;It packed well and was delivered in perfect shape.
I:1982;2036;The movie was a lot of fun to watch and the blu.
I:1982;2037;I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action flicks or comic book based heros.
I:1982;2038;It is one of my favorites!
I:1982;2039;This product shipped quickly, and watching this movie is so much fun!
I:1982;2040;I really loved this movie until the big fight at the end.
I:1982;2041;Robert Downey Jr. is one of the better actors and he was perfect fit for this movie.
I:1982;2042;This is a clear definition of summer blockbuster.
I:1982;2043;Great special effects and great acting from all the stars.
I:1982;2044;Other than that really good movie.
I:1982;2045;Iron Man is simply one of the best.
I:1982;2046;Iron Man stands with the best, a true revival for the super hero genera on par with the great super hero movies such as Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins.
I:1982;2047;From the start of this film Tony is one of the MOST likable guys to ever grace the big screen.
I:1982;2048;He's charming, smart, witty, funny, hardcore, and a bit of a ladies man.
I:1982;2049;"As he eloquently puts it
I:1982;2050;"That's how America does it, that's how my dad did it, and it's worked out pretty well so far."""
I:1982;2051;But he has a few tricks up his sleeves and manages to escape by building, you guest it, an Iron Man.
I:1982;2052;far and away the best thing this movie accomplishes is creating likable characters who may not be as relatable as, say, Peter Parker, but who are definitely just as cool or sympathetic.
I:1982;2053;is perfect in her role as personal assistant/love interest with all her witty dialog and charm.
I:1982;2054;"The Afghan man Tony meets while in captivity is also a great contrast to Starks cocky and care free attitude
I:1982;2055;One was always at a disadvantage during the whole fight.
I:1982;2056;if you're a super hero movie fan then you HAVE to see this flick.
I:1982;2057;Oh, and one more thing, if your willing to wait ten minutes for the credits to finish there is a thirty second scene at the end that may be worth seeing as it sets the stage for a sequel pretty well.
I:1982;2058;There has been at least one review that highlighted some of the sexual scenes in the film.
I:1982;2059;at it's heart, IM was a great movie that happened to be about a superhero.
I:1982;2060;This made the action sequences more enjoyable, and highlighted the acting prowess of the great cast (how'd they get Gwyeneth Paltrow to sign on at Potts?!)
I:1982;2061;Oh well, I never said I wrote reviews for a living, and maybe that's a good thing!
I:1982;2062;We all enjoyed it: myself, my wife and our 9 year old son.
I:1982;2063;The whole cast was great.
I:1982;2064;They are more realistic then ever.
I:1982;2065;I've been told I have great taste in movies from a lot of people, friends and family and some people I just met.
I:1982;2066;So what that's what makes action movies great.
I:1982;2067;I thought it was a kickass movie.
I:1982;2068;iron man and the hulk and batman and wanted were all good movies.
I:1982;2069;They made their millions and you see more 5 and 4 star votes on here then you do 1 star soo you know most people liked this movie.
I:1982;2070;Even then, it holds its own.
I:1982;2071;The movie is similarly human, with drama, humor and a touch of the poignant.
I:1982;2072;Get ready to be entertained folks!
I:1982;2073;After all, many of the comic books transformed to films have a history of sucking hard, but Iron Man comes through with a finely adapted screenplay, top notch action, not to mention a great cast.
I:1982;2074;I hope this time around, he's here to stay.
I:1982;2075;Stark decides to do something else, and in of all places, makes his greatest creation to free himself from captivity.
I:1982;2076;the suite which is a crude form of what will be his masterpiece.
I:1982;2077;upon his escape and back home, he has an epiphany.
I:1982;2078;well worth watching, Iron Man finishes SOLID.
I:1982;2079;Downey 's character has some great lines and lots of dry, sarcastic and quirky humor.
I:1982;2080;It keeps a good flow through the entire film from start to finish.
I:1982;2081;Of course in this day an age in film making, Iron Man finishes with the hint (and most likely the promise) of continuing stories to come in the future.
I:1982;2082;Iron Man is a must see motion picture for those who love not only comic books but also those who want to see a form of entertainment with a myriad of great action sequences and special effects.
I:1982;2083;Robert Downey, Jr., I must say, is perfectly cast for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man.
I:1982;2084;Arguably, he is a larger than life individual who is playing a character who seems to be, well, larger than life.
I:1982;2085;from a philosophical and social standpoint, one can assert that the Iron Man story portrayed on the silver screen effectively elicits the advantages and disadvantages of being charismatic and brilliant.
I:1982;2086;Like Reed Richards, perhaps the greatest scientific mind in the Marvel Universe, Stark is a highly intelligent individual whose talents draw him recognition.
I:1982;2087;He is a celebrity, a lady's man, and a leading industrialist who has achieved international fame.
I:1982;2088;And it is because of these traits that Stark is surrounded by those who claim to be his friends or fans but who may actually be, at best, people who are trying to vicariously live off the greatness of Tony Stark or, at worst, plagiaristic, corporate sharks who want to build Stark up with hopes of eventually tearing him down.
I:1982;2089;if the focus had merely been upon the social interactions of Stark and how he could maintain his levels of success both publicly and privately, a great movie would nonetheless be developed.
I:1982;2090;until he finally gets it right!There are several angles and aspects by which one can ascertain this particular cinematic experience.
I:1982;2091;For those who are curious about what separates Iron Man from the other excellent movies to date that are based upon the superheroes of Marvel Comics, let me say this.
I:1982;2092;Tony Stark is easily one of the coolest characters with and without the suit, considering his fast remarks and big attitude.
I:1982;2093;I loved this movie when I saw it in theatres and couldn't wait to get it.
I:1982;2094;I bought a ps3 which opened my world to blu.
I:1982;2095;Also the audio was great through my surround sound.
I:1982;2096;ray and I highly recommend it!
I:1982;2097;This is a great movie overall for all ages, I recommend for anyone to watch, nothing bad about it, delivered on time which was great.
I:1982;2098;What a great movie that looks perfect for watching it in Blu.
I:1982;2099;The colors and definition of the picture is superb.
I:1982;2100;But, the publicity campaign was effective and the effort was touted as having been produced with a high level of artistic skill and vision.

I:1982;2110;Its a feat of acting ability and almost comic, because Downey never does anything that even remotely suggests any degree of physical intimacy.
I:1982;2111;He's at work in the billionairei's workshop .
I:1982;2112;Very flashy toys on display.
I:1982;2113;that's right, flies to Afghanistan .
I:1982;2114;well, if you enjoy this genre of action movies .
I:1982;2115;capes and gadgets and super.
I:1982;2116;you accept the improbabilites that go along with the fantasies.
I:1982;2117;And, you have your roster of favorite stars, and you might have wondered how it came about that Robert downey Jr got cast in the role?
I:1982;2118;La Paltrow is a personal friend of both men and has appeared with them both in various films.
I:1982;2119;which he did so perfectly in SOAP DISH, one of the best Show.
I:1982;2120;As Downs sufferers share a round.

I:1982;2122;Everybody in the entire movie is bigger than he is, and some tower over him.
I:1982;2123;Look at it once and return it the next day.
I:1982;2124;It's good for a bag of popcorn.
I:1982;2125;IRON MAN, I saw it when it first came out, it's a Very Good movie, Robert Downey Jr Nailed it on the head in the role, I don't like that Cheadle replaced his friend in the upcoming Iron man Movie.
I:1982;2126;It's funny,fun and lots of Action and seems true to the comic book from my point of view.
I:1982;2127;Hope the next installment is as good as this.
I:1982;2128;Fun, entertaining, and well written.
I:1982;2129;Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect Tony Stark.
I:1982;2130;This is a superhero action movie with a beating heart.
I:1982;2131;This movie was top of the line.
I:1982;2132;Robert Downey Jr. shows the emotional range of an earthworm.
I:1982;2133;Let's hope this is the last we see from this group.
I:1982;2134;He's on a mission to save the world.
I:1982;2135;Great movie and can watch over and over again.
I:1982;2136;The movie is one of the best movie i saw on blue ray.
I:1982;2137;As far as I am concerned, this is the best movie I have seen all year and I see alot of them.
I:1982;2138;Robert Downey Jr. is superb as well as the supporting cast.
I:1982;2139;Better than all of the big hits put together, including The Dark Knight.
I:1982;2140;and I see that after credit it goes to show you they are going to making a avengers movie and I mean the comic book ones with all the Marvel superheroes.
I:1982;2141;I think they did an excellent job in this one .
I:1982;2142;creating the background and characters in a reasonable and understandable way, plus some great actions shots.
I:1982;2143;I had never done the 'gift' option, but it was great.
I:1982;2144;He got a gift receipt with my little note on it.
I:1982;2145;Such a great idea!Thank you!
I:1982;2146;This is a very good move that is action packed.
I:1982;2147;The computer generated special effects were down right impressive.
I:1982;2148;Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job as Stark.
I:1982;2149;however this is one of those super hero movies that little boys love and will watch over and over.
I:1982;2150;Actually, it was the first time I really enjoyed my PS3's Blu.
I:1982;2151;Also enjoyed the interactive bonus features (Iron Man trivia) and the story behind the character.
I:1982;2152;and, by the way, gwyneth paltrow looks amazing in this movie.
I:1982;2153;The first iron man was the best one .
I:1982;2154;Of course, I liked Robert Downey in this, but the other characters were good
I:1982;2155;This was a great movie and the box that I got it in was in great condition!
I:1982;2156;What with the magic of movie making tricks, a great cast, a creative director, and the edgy, cagey star power of Downey, why wouldn't this movie be a hit?
I:1982;2157;He must escape with the mysterious, multi.
I:1982;2158;how he came to be, his inner turmoil leading to a change in professional and personal direction.
I:1982;2159;It is his face, those eyes that make his every close.
I:1982;2160;In his early middle age, Downey has IT and makes IT work in his character and role.
I:1982;2161;other actors contribute as much: Jeff Bridges (always a favorite actor) becomes an excellent villain.
I:1982;2162;My gosh, in his first scene the viewer knows he will be a villain.
I:1982;2163;Terrence Howard continues to build his impressive resume here, although he doesn't have as much to do, but his last line sets his role in a sequel.
I:1982;2164;again, the viewer knows that her role will also expand in the future.
I:1982;2165;Iron Man is an exciting movie.
I:1982;2166;I expect to see it again!
I:1982;2167;it's that good (if you like violence and excitement and creative genius and heroes and desire to do the right thing and.
I:1982;2168;The perfect old movie for a cold wet spring night.
I:1982;2169;Brings back memories of when we first saw it in the theater
I:1982;2170;I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
I:1982;2171;After all, he is a well reknown genius.
I:1982;2172;nevertheless, this movie is definitely watchable and re.
I:1982;2173;all said, it is, in a word, fantastic.
I:1982;2174;Rober Downey Jr. is an excellent actor and he truely shined as Tony Spark.
I:1982;2175;This movie is a must for any Marvel or action fan.
I:1982;2176;Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Iron Man and I now cannot picture any other Iron Man.
I:1982;2177;I like the movie but the movie was stalling during the peak of the action.
I:1982;2178;the movie was great , the disk was in perfect shape and the play feature worked great, in all it was exactly what I wanted
I:1982;2179;Now, these weren't the first rumors of an Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, they were just the most credible.
I:1982;2180;That was until director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey, Jr. made the movie into an incredible reality that took the 2008 summer box office by storm.
I:1982;2181;tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a rich, powerful, and undeniably brilliant weapons manufacturer, womanizer, and self.
I:1982;2182;"Clad in a metallic suit of his own design, Tony finally knows what his purpose is in life, and as the hero known as ""Iron Man"" he now has the means by which to protect the people he once put in harm's way."
I:1982;2183;truth be told, the long wait between those first rumors in the 90's to now, was probably just what the movie needed to become a true success, for several reasons.
I:1982;2184;Second, the perfect casting choice was made in the form of Robert Downey, Jr., a talented actor who has had his fair share of troubles (many of which are surprisingly similar to Tony Stark's in the comic books), and one whose star power wasn't great enough that his private life would outshine anything done on the screen.
I:1982;2185;Lastly, Marvel was finally able to create their own movie studio, allowing them full creative control and ensuring that the character and story were as true to the source material as possible.
I:1982;2186;fold: on one hand the story is a tale of redemption for a man who has lived a life of self.
I:1982;2187;"indulgence and freedom from any sort of consequences to his actions
I:1982;2188;As a moviegoer and comic book aficionado I love when an adaptation of one of my heroes comes to life on the big screen as both a faithful representation (or as close as one can get to decades of comic history in only a couple of hours), as well as a really strong film that isn't just a bunch of summer popcorn movie fluff.
I:1982;2189;"Generally, when the number of writers goes beyond two, the chances for the film actually working out all that well dwindle significantly
I:1982;2190;"Filled with plenty of humor, action, drama, and a dash of romance, the story for ""Iron Man"" is easily one of the best origin adaptations for a superhero that I have ever seen in a movie."
I:1982;2191;for this film, fledgling Marvel Studios wisely chose to sort of buck the Hollywood system by going with some truly surprising, yet inspired choices for both cast and crew.
I:1982;2192;"Sure, Favreau proved he could handle family comedy with ""Elf"", and some of his early work is fairly dramatic, and as far as visual effects goes, he did a decent enough job on ""Zathura""
I:1982;2193;con, much to the vast delight of many a comic geek.
I:1982;2194;Even though he hardly seemed the proper fit for the character, Robert perfectly captured the very nature of Tony Stark right down to his physical appearance, quick.
I:1982;2195;wit, and attitude, for all intents and purposes Downey, Jr. was Tony Stark through and through.
I:1982;2196;"Rounding out the main supporting cast members is Terrence Howard (""Four Brothers"") as James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, an Air Force pilot, and close friend to Tony Stark."
I:1982;2197;Terrence was again another terrific choice, and he really played well off of anything Robert Downey, Jr. would throw at him.
I:1982;2198;downs and sarcasm really helped to solidify their close, almost brotherly bond the two men share with one another.
I:1982;2199;"Iron Man was one of 2008's biggest blockbusters, second only to ""The Dark Knight"", and the film rightfully earns its place amongst the best comic book adaptations ever made."
I:1982;2200;"Boasting a strong story, visually stunning special effects, brilliant casting decisions, and just some good old fashioned fun, ""Iron Man"" is not just a comic book blockbuster, but a great movie that audiences will enjoy over and over again."
I:1982;2201;I had high expectations going into this movie.
I:1982;2202;Iron Man is far and away my favorite comic book character.
I:1982;2203;Iron Man was an absolutely incredible movie, and is an example of what a perfectly executed super.
I:1982;2204;I knew a good chunk of the movie would be focused on Iron Man's origin story, and I thought it was handled well.
I:1982;2205;Setting it in Afghanistan instead of Vietnam was a smart move that kept things relevant.
I:1982;2206;was handled just as well.
I:1982;2207;The fact that Stane, an arguably obscure character in the Iron Man series, was used at all was a bold move, and one that I thought paid off.
I:1982;2208;the movie's main asset was the strength of its cast.
I:1982;2209;His performance was brilliant, and his Stark was the perfect blend of the old school industrialist Stan Lee originally created and the boozing playboy Mark Millar depicted in the Ultimates.
I:1982;2210;I thought it looked sufficiently realistic throughout the movie, not to mention completely cool.
I:1982;2211;1: Extremis) designed the definitive Iron Man suit of the past 20 years, and it was good to see it used in the movie.
I:1982;2212;Talk about taking a page from the Ultimates!Needless to say, I absolutely loved Iron Man.
I:1982;2213;It did justice to the character, established another viable franchise for Marvel, and has to be ranked as one of the best super.
I:1982;2214;There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property.
I:1982;2215;Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation.
I:1982;2216;With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider.
I:1982;2217;man and X. men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight.
I:1982;2218;We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor.
I:1982;2219;Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.
I:1982;2220;His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company.
I:1982;2221;We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects.
I:1982;2222;By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel.
I:1982;2223;Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime.
I:1982;2224;He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic.
I:1982;2225;the real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over.40 to be a superhero.
I:1982;2226;I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene.
I:1982;2227;as for the rest of the cast, they all do well.
I:1982;2228;"top, but appropriately so
I:1982;2229;"one can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors
I:1982;2230;The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end.
I:1982;2231;What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office.
I:1982;2232;A perfect sequel thematically and tonally, and it delivers SO much comedy, action, and eye candy.
I:1982;2233;Jon Favreau is easily one of the best directors working today, Justin Theroux's script is surprisingly clever and complex, RDJ is of course hilarious, and (as always) Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell are fantastic.
I:1982;2234;howard Stark as a Howard Hughes/Walt Disney type of public figure.
I:1982;2235;the hero vs. hero battle actually managed to feel like a scene from 70s/80s Iron Man comics.
I:1982;2236;Robert Downey Jr is becoming a great actor.
I:1982;2237;His performance as Tony Stark is great.
I:1982;2238;Love the sarcasm he brings to the role.
I:1982;2239;The strongest entries into the new superhero movie genre.
I:1982;2240;Brilliant casting, slick effects, and an excellent plot.
I:1982;2241;Downey is charming, intense and magnetic.
I:1982;2242;Yes, I liked the special effects, the hardware stuff and to an extent, the story.
I:1982;2243;By the way, Pepper was a sweet addition.
I:1982;2244;The witty humor and likeable characters are just amazing.
I:1982;2245;Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect fit for Tony Stark.
I:1982;2246;Iron Man is a delightful popcorn movie, full of action, humor, and a hiss.
I:1982;2247;It's among the best of the superhero films, in my opinion, and just a lot of fun.
I:1982;2248;ray are clean and crisp.
I:1982;2249;Love Robert Downey Jr. in this part with his quick wit and flash.
I:1982;2250;Gwynneth Paltrow fits with him as his equally intelligent, up for the challenge balancing counterpart.
I:1982;2251;Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super.
I:1982;2252;hero, a science fiction, an action.
I:1982;2253;action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel.
I:1982;2254;good movie, all rolled into one.
I:1982;2255;in IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan.
I:1982;2256;In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes.
I:1982;2257;all of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable.
I:1982;2258;Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real.
I:1982;2259;The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil.
I:1982;2260;The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun.
I:1982;2261;Thank you for the timely shipping of my product.
I:1982;2262;This was a very good movie that entertained the whole family.
I:1982;2263;My 8 year old wanted to watch it every day for several days.
I:1982;2264;Robert Downey, Jr. is Awesome!
I:1982;2265;Okay the discs, case and everything came in excellent shape.
I:1982;2266;The insert is removable, with artwork on the inside .
I:1982;2267;The effects were great, the storyline was great, the characters (along with all their virtues and flaws) were believable.
I:1982;2268;i would highly recommend this movie to anyone (especially comic book fans!)
I:1982;2269;Will appeal to anyone who enjoys science and technology and putting things together.
I:1982;2270;Five stars all the way!
I:1982;2271;Was pleased with the graphic.
I:1982;2272;Loved it, loved the characters, and the actors were great.
I:1982;2273;"All I have to do now is live with the ""I told you so's"" from my son and granddaughter."
I:1982;2274;Still an entertaining movie a definite must see.
I:1982;2275;This Ironman storyline is great and R. d. Jr is Great as Tony Stark!!
I:1982;2276;If for no other reason, see this film for Robert Downey, Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark.
I:1982;2277;He's endlessly entertaining in the role.
I:1982;2278;I have always loved Robert Downey Jr., so thats why I went to see Iron Man when it came out.
I:1982;2279;Now going to watch Iron Man 2!
I:1982;2280;The whole family enjoyed this movie with it's futuristic gadgets and the adventure.
I:1982;2281;Saw it in the theater.
I:1982;2282;something, he is quite proficient now.
I:1982;2283;He remains single and enjoys a romp with the ladies, now and then.
I:1982;2284;Stark has an awesome car, his own plane, and a computer system that would probably make Bill Gates drool, complete with holographic imaging.
I:1982;2285;Instead he builds a very special iron man suit.
I:1982;2286;jeff Bridges, with a shaved head, plays an interesting role.
I:1982;2287;This is a super good action film.
I:1982;2288;Great job by all the actors.
I:1982;2289;The computer graphic imaging was great, too.
I:1982;2290;I absolutely love Downey Jr. as an actor and this movie as well.
I:1982;2291;My favorite super hero blockbuster to date.
I:1982;2292;I love the fresh feeling #1 brought to the super hero film family so far.
I:1982;2293;great movie for anyone into the Avenger series.
I:1982;2294;ironman is my favorite of these superheroes.
I:1982;2295;Iron Man is one of the best damn movies to come out this year.
I:1982;2296;He brought this remarkable character to life and I can't wait for the sequel in two years.
I:1982;2297;Robert Downey Jr is pretty funny and this movie is at least worth watching.
I:1982;2298;Jon Favreau (SwingersandElf) effectively directs the screen adaptation for the comic book superhero Iron Man.
I:1982;2299;tuning ahead of him in terms of directing action films but Iron Man is still among the very best comic book character based films so far.
I:1982;2300;It is about as entertaining as you can get and the few flaws that are present are almost entirely forgivable due to Favreau's knack for developing characters and also understating drama effectively.
I:1982;2301;It might be important to note that it is hard to contain myself and write an honest review, because in all of my years of reading comics, Iron Man, along with perhaps the Silver Surfer, is my favorite comic book character of them all.
I:1982;2302;Fortunately for me, unlike last year'sFantastic Four sequel, this particular film truly delivers in terms of satisfying the little long lost comic book geek.
I:1982;2303;There were actually moments during the film that I looked over to my brother in full wide.
I:1982;2304;The kid in me absolutely loved this movie.
I:1982;2305;A new man with new motives, Stark develops his suit further and becomes an unlikely but befitting hero.
I:1982;2306;one can tell by the promotions that the special effects are great and they are amazing from beginning to end.
I:1982;2307;The chemistry between Stark and his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) works remarkably well and far better than I would've expected.
I:1982;2308;Jeff Bridges is also great as the villain Obidiah Stane and the rest of the cast is solid all around, with the exception of perhaps Terrence Howard he unfortunately seems to be going through the motions here.
I:1982;2309;But overall, the magic of this film is the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role.
I:1982;2310;He is perfect for the role in almost every way.
I:1982;2311;Somehow he gives us a hero we feel compelled to find a reason to root for despite his flaws.
I:1982;2312;this definitely receives a high recommendation from me for pretty much anyone looking for a fun and compelling action movie.
I:1982;2313;If you can picture that blend, great, if not, think highly intelligent and handy with whatever is lying around playboy who has a bit of a heart change after facing death and barely cheating it.
I:1982;2314;The film clipped along at a fast, tense pace.
I:1982;2315;Plenty of humor, a little love, sarcasm and some skin are tossed in.
I:1982;2316;the language is pretty clean.
I:1982;2317;hero like he was born to play it.
I:1982;2318;The film felt comic booky with sharp visuals and colors, and should appeal to the lovers of the comic book films.
I:1982;2319;Bridges gets kudos for his portrayal, as well.
I:1982;2320;I was pleased that the price was decent and I was able to add this to my collection.
I:1982;2321;A movie based on a comic book character that not only doesn't suck, it actually improves on the original story of the origins of the character!
I:1982;2322;That said, this is just a great movie with a smart story and excellent casting.
I:1982;2323;Absolutely great to own and can't wait for the sequel.
I:1982;2324;I loved the movie at the theatre and love the Blu.
I:1982;2325;We had both seen it before but enjoyed watching again.
I:1982;2326;It is in my top 10 favorites list.
I:1982;2327;Robert Downey Jr is the man!
I:1982;2328;I have never been a fan of his, but I was very impressed by his role as Tony Stark.
I:1982;2329;The supporting cast is also amazing.
I:1982;2330;This is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen.
I:1982;2331;It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and leave you speechless.

I:1982;2336;Starks ego is appropriately served!)
I:1982;2337;But, Favreau must be a fan or at least understands what comic fans want, as well as grasping the needs action/popcorn fare.
I:1982;2338;Great Movie with fantastic special effects.
I:1982;2339;Wow, what a nice surprise to walk out of the theater feeling as if I'd just witnessed a solid drama interspersed with excellent FX and action sequences.
I:1982;2340;Instead, Tony Stark comes across as one of the most believable characters to grace a comic book film adaptation.

I:1982;2343;the cast is solid, from Terrence Howard as Rhodes to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.

I:1982;2348;The story is interesting, funny at just the right times, and never falls back on action or FX to bail out a scene.
I:1982;2349;Iron Man is a very, very good film.
I:1982;2350;That makes a good film in my book.
I:1982;2351;There's a tad bit of language and one swift roll in the hay between two characters.
I:1982;2352;The action is explosive, literally, and some younger kids may be put off by a few of the deaths in the film.
I:1982;2353;highly recommended and hopefully a sign of things to come this summer film season.
I:1982;2354;I love amazon but super bummed.
I:1982;2355;This is a fun movie . . . my son and I were enthralled throughout.
I:1982;2356;disc edition . . . lets us watch anywhere in the house.
I:1982;2357;amazon, as usual, shipped quick and sent exactly what we expected!
I:1982;2358;I've heard how great this movie is for months.
I:1982;2359;So I finally get to see it.
I:1982;2360;Love that RDJ found his niche in life.
I:1982;2361;depth reviews on this movie to give anyone who is less than a comic book purist a great idea what the story line is and how true to the comic series it is.
I:1982;2362;my 11 year old son and I have seen enough movies together to be able to separate good movies from great ones, and this will stand out as one of the great movies of 2008 and one of the best of the comic book movie genre, even rivaling the Batman series.
I:1982;2363;Great bargin as i bought it during BFS.
I:1982;2364;After a week of hounding, I finally agreed to watch the first two so we could go as a family.
I:1982;2365;i was surprised to find myself completely engaged and entertained.
I:1982;2366;Robert Downey Jr. has created a character who is egotistical and self.
I:1982;2367;centered, yet intelligent and worthy of your respect.
I:1982;2368;I found those equally entertaining.
I:1982;2369;if you are looking for great film.
I:1982;2370;However if you want a few hours of fun to escape reality, this is a great choice.
I:1982;2371;Viewed it with my son, had a blast!
I:1982;2372;Pretty good movie, good acting, but i think that most of these reviews are praising it too much.
I:1982;2373;Robert Doney Jr is really good in this movie.
I:1982;2374;He's funny, the movie is fast paced and is very interesting.
I:1982;2375;Iron Man is a very awesome movie to watch.
I:1982;2376;i was surprised at how the story drew me in and the action kept me focused.
I:1982;2377;ironman is a good movie.
I:1982;2378;I love this movie, it was a great one, it one of the best.
I:1982;2379;Robert Downey Jr. fits the bill perfectly!
I:1982;2380;I just love every single thing about this movie!
I:1982;2381;It is full of action.
I:1982;2382;It creates a good feeling inside after seeing it.
I:1982;2383;It just makes me happy.
I:1982;2384;Of course the beginning is dark, but Tony Stark becomes such a true hero.
I:1982;2385;From utter prick to hero!
I:1982;2386;Iron man is here and destined to become a classic.
I:1982;2387;This film has a great plot, lots of action, and villians that are awsome.
I:1982;2388;Robert Downey Jr. is a gem in this and back with a vengence!
I:1982;2389;It has PERFECT affects and PERFECT sounds and everything!
I:1982;2390;Truthfully I think that Amazon did an amazing job with this movie!!
I:1982;2391;I really enjoy watching Robert Downey Jr. perform.
I:1982;2392;He is wonderful and the special effects are great.
I:1982;2393;Excellent movie with lots of action and humor, no foul language or sex scenes, which made it a great date movie.
I:1982;2394;Amazon was great with there return policy.
I:1982;2395;Hardhitting stuff, the storyline and CGIs.
I:1982;2396;tech gadgetry and dedicates his life to saving the world, IRON MAN is a witty and intelligent action film.
I:1982;2397;One minute he is the Playboy of The Western World a la James Bond.
I:1982;2398;beautiful yes, but more so translucently lovely, Ms. Paltrow has an inborn grace that softly overwhelms the viewer.
I:1982;2399;Paltrow's competent but feminine Pepper therefore, is the perfect counterpoint to Downey's brash Iron Man.
I:1982;2400;this movie is definitely a cut above most Superhero films, a real Summer Movie.
I:1982;2401;Marvel is constantly perfecting their cinematic craft.
I:1982;2402;It's just that all the origin stories kind of resemble each other after awhile.
I:1982;2403;I never thought I would see a cool Iron Man movie in my lifetime.
I:1982;2404;besically this is your regular summer entertainment almost all the way.
I:1982;2405;A superhero action movie done by.
I:1982;2406;The hero secretly builds a powered suit of steel armor and escapes.
I:1982;2407;the conflicts in this movie are very simple and show opposing sides playing the game of escalation in which the former weapon merchant and genius inventor clearly wins.
I:1982;2408;robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin) is expectedly very good, although I have a feeling he didn't have to strain himself very much playing the cartoonish Tony Stark/Ironman.
I:1982;2409;He definitely makes the best from what he gets.
I:1982;2410;Special effects are cool and are the best part of the movie and prevent it from being a complete disaster.
I:1982;2411;all in all this is a good summer entertainment but nothing to ponder about after watching.
I:1982;2412;It was action packed with interesting characters.
I:1982;2413;It was a well written film with outstanding actors.
I:1982;2414;Robert Downey jr. was amazing as ironman.
I:1982;2415;Instead, using his intelligence and ingenuity, Tony builds a high.
I:1982;2416;When he uncovers a nefarious plot with global implications, he dons his powerful armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man.
I:1982;2417;The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (in a terrific career.
I:1982;2418;defining performance as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Terrence Howard (as Jim Rhodes), Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger), and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Virginia 'Pepper' Potts) is excellent!
I:1982;2419;"The directing by Jon Favreau (who also directed ""Elf"" (2003), ""Zathura"" (2005), and ""Made"" (2001) is excellent!"
I:1982;2420;"nominated screenplay for ""Children Of Men"" (2006), Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway (both who also wrote the story and screenplay to the upcoming ""Punisher: War Zone"" (2008) is excellent!"
I:1982;2421;"The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also did the music to ""Mr. Brooks"" (2007) and the tv show ""Prison Break"") is excellent!"
I:1982;2422;"The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who also did the cinematography to ""The Number 23"" (2007) is excellent!"
I:1982;2423;"The film editing by Dan Lebental (who also did the film editing to ""Elf"" and ""Zathura"") is excellent!"
I:1982;2424;"The casting by Sarah Finn and Randi Hiller (who also did the casting to ""Vantage Point"" (2008), ""Never Back Down"" (2008), and the upcoming ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"" (2008) is excellent!"
I:1982;2425;"man 3"" (2007) is excellent!"
I:1982;2426;"man 3"" and the upcoming ""The Soloist"" (2008), which also stars Downey, Jr.) is excellent!"
I:1982;2427;"The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who also did the set decoration to ""Zathura"" and the upcoming ""Land Of The Lost"" (2009) is excellent!"
I:1982;2428;"The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon (who also did the costume design to ""Elf"", ""Zathura"", and ""Made"") is excellent!"
I:1982;2429;book movie that works on all cylinders.
I:1982;2430;This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best, by so far, this year.
I:1982;2431;This is also a excellent movie to start the summer movie season off.
I:1982;2432;Great movie, arrived on time.
I:1982;2433;I never read the comics so the story is new to me but I found it fast paced and exciting.
I:1982;2434;I love the Iron Man series.
I:1982;2435;It's one of my favorite of all the superhero movies!
I:1982;2436;Robert Downy Jr. is incredible and really funny!
I:1982;2437;He's a comic book/graphic novel/sf guru.
I:1982;2438;I very much enjoyed Iron Man.
I:1982;2439;It is amazing to watch his character evolve and see the light.
I:1982;2440;It was a bit violent for me, but the story is excellent with lots of plot twists.
I:1982;2441;The pacing was very good.
I:1982;2442;There is a lot of humor and just a little romance.
I:1982;2443;This is sure to be the blockbuster start of an awesome summer movie season.
I:1982;2444;Jon Favreau delivers an awesome movie!
I:1982;2445;A good comic book transition.
I:1982;2446;He steals the technology that keeps Stark alive and uses it to power his own Iron Man.
I:1982;2447;Everyone lives happily ever after and he reveals himself to be Iron Man.
I:1982;2448;if you're going to see or have already seen the Avengers (2012), it's best if you watch Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man and Iron Man 2.
I:1982;2449;This is a super good movie, fun to watch and leaves you smiling.
I:1982;2450;The technology is great and the actors in the movie are fantastic, loved it.
I:1982;2451;Love this move and have watched it many times!
I:1982;2452;Robert Downey Jr. once again shows why he is a truly gifted actor.
I:1982;2453;this one is a great one to get if you like the first one where he becomes iron man.
I:1982;2454;Good movie, a mostly appropriate gift for my son, although there are a couple of parts we have to skip over that are NOT child (8.10) appropriate.
I:1982;2455;This flick has moved to the top of my favorite all.
I:1982;2456;time movie comic book hero list.
I:1982;2457;Awesome acting, special effects, soundtrack.
I:1982;2458;Good story and everything looks real, not cgi.
I:1982;2459;I loved the comedy and action of this movie.
I:1982;2460;I do watch it every so often.
I:1982;2461;I still have to go back and look at it again to get a full understanding.
I:1982;2462;I am not a fan of Robert Downey Jr., but he is a great actor in this role.
I:1982;2463;the character of Iron man fits Robert Downey Jr. who is not afraid of authority, witty, brilliant, and ultimately makes this flick a gem.
I:1982;2464;additionally, Iron man shows himself in box office just in a right time since we are a tad fed up with the aforementioned superhero sequels.
I:1982;2465;This movie is exciting, funny in some scenes, sexy and shows a man that wants to change the world after his own creation almost kill him and brings catastrophe to the world and how his inventions are also assisting terrorists to bring terror upon innocent people.
I:1982;2466;A must see movie to see how a so sure of himself individual have a change of heart towards humanity
I:1982;2467;year old son absolutely had to have this movie.
I:1982;2468;I preordered it and it came on the release date.
I:1982;2469;I absolutely love the AMAZON preordering option.
I:1982;2470;"sound effects are expectedly (in this day and age) superb, the visuals are top notch, especially for a movie that involves a lot of ""metal""."
I:1982;2471;The box, the protection and the movie was in excellen condition, but the movie its extraordinary with the special effects!!!
I:1982;2472;the Visual Effects are amazing, Robert Downey Jr. is very good as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the cast is pretty wonderful in this first film financed by Marvel Studios.
I:1982;2473;Awesome movie and I cannot wait to see two and three!!!
I:1982;2474;ray it is absolutely AWESOME!
I:1982;2475;Iron Man is the best solo superhero movie series.
I:1982;2476;robert Downey JR is great as Tony Stark.
I:1982;2477;I was never actually a fan of Iron Man since he was affiliated with The Avengers and I was wild for the X. men.
I:1982;2478;I do get it that this is the first movie and it takes time to develop the story of how Iron Man came to be.
I:1982;2479;Anchored by a top rate performance by Robert Downey Jr., this exciting, well directed take on Iron Man will go down as one of the best comic book movies out this generation.
I:1982;2480;The respect and love of the filmmakers for the material is evident throughout the film.
I:1982;2481;ray Ultimate Edition is fantastic.
I:1982;2482;The writers and artists who have worked on Iron Man over the years take part in the documentary, discussing what changes they made to the character and why.
I:1982;2483;As someone who didn't really follow the Iron Man comic book, I found the documentary to be fascinating.
I:1982;2484;You can view each suit from any angle, checking out the function/feature of each piece.
I:1982;2485;What we're missing on this disc is something I really wanted.
I:1982;2486;As a whole, it is a well done documentary.
I:1982;2487;I highly recommend watching this.
I:1982;2488;The 2nd disc also contains a 27 minute featurette on the special effects and Robert Downey Jr.'s screen test,In the end, the movie is the star here, but this is a very well done special edition.
I:1982;2489;One of the best comic book movies I've ever seen.
I:1982;2490;Downey gives a great performance.
I:1982;2491;The special effects looked good, and the storyline is believable.
I:1982;2492;It's flashy in appearance but gritty in content.
I:1982;2493;Hope the sequel is as good.
I:1982;2494;It's clever, funny, and there's tons of action.
I:1982;2495;A great start to the series.
I:1982;2496;Paltrow is not my favorite, but she did a good job in this film and Downey was made for the part.
I:1982;2497;Fun, engaging, movie with good acting by all cast members.
I:1982;2498;Nice special effects and good storyline.
I:1982;2499;The length of the movie was perfect.
I:1982;2500;I am glad that both adults and kids may enjoy watching this film.
I:1982;2501;"now that I have that bit of business out of the way, let me say that ""Iron Man"" is the best comic book superhero movie I have seen since ""Spider."
I:1982;2502;summer blockbuster, with the added angst of Stark growing a conscience and using his armored alter.
I:1982;2503;This movie has two or three of the best violent slapstick gags you have ever seen in one of these movies, which engenders some of the biggest laughs.
I:1982;2504;"The origin of the character is fairly faithful, for being updated, to what happened in ""Tales of Suspense"" #39, which was plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by his brother Larry Leiber, drawn by Don Heck, with a cover art by Jack Kirby (who created the character's original look, although it was Steve Ditko who first drew the red and gold armored version)."
I:1982;2505;For all of the humor in the script, there is a strong thread of serious stuff extending throughout this film.
I:1982;2506;"as Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., a superb actor whose skills in the verbal repartee department were honed on ""Ally McBeal,"" may well be the most glib superhero we have seen on the silver screen."
I:1982;2507;All that really matters is that the cast and characters are a perfect mesh and the people who put this movie together should be thinking not just about a sequel but about a series.
I:1982;2508;"man"" and boy, does this trilogy look promising with its first chapter."
I:1982;2509;Well consider that I was still able to see it over one month since it's release date and it's still showing with multiple show times.
I:1982;2510;Famed film critic Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four stars even.
I:1982;2511;Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark, a intelligent, B. a. businessman and engineer.
I:1982;2512;Every character was perfectly cast in my opinion.
I:1982;2513;industrial Light and Magic delivers again this summer with their work in Iron Man.
I:1982;2514;This is a decent movie.
I:1982;2515;live features yet, but the movie itself is just like Spiderman, Batman, Hulk, Transformers etc so if you are into those movies, you'll like this one too.
I:1982;2516;Yet it does work and he gives a terrific performance.
I:1982;2517;IRON MAN is the first of their own films and their plans are ambitious to say the least.
I:1982;2518;It will be interesting to see if the latter beats JLA to the big screen.
I:1982;2519;Great Movie, my kids loved it!
I:1982;2520;Robert Downey Jr is amazing.
I:1982;2521;Iron Man entertains exceedingly well thanks to the jovial performance of Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;2522;"Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for ""Chaplin"" and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TV's ""Ally McBeal."""
I:1982;2523;The great humor that Downey brings to the role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better.
I:1982;2524;There is also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow for 1998'sShakespeare in Love.
I:1982;2525;"Perhaps one of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar winning ""Crash"" as the Iranian store clerk."
I:1982;2526;Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent.
I:1982;2527;This is a great action/special effects picture.
I:1982;2528;It came promptly and was in great condition.
I:1982;2529;Love RDJ and the entire cast is awesome!
I:1982;2530;The Iron Man saga is truly an adventure in cinema that is worth the price of a ticket.
I:1982;2531;We will continue to support these epic movies.
I:1982;2532;wise, it had a relatively simple plot.
I:1982;2533;he was injured, ironically by a shrapnel from one of his own rockets .
I:1982;2534;kept alive by a make.
I:1982;2535;of course, he managed to escape .
I:1982;2536;magnet over his heart intact .
I:1982;2537;magnet imbedded over his heart and exchanging it with a miniaturised Arc Reactor .
I:1982;2538;free, and at the same time, could provide adequate power to a new armoured suit he had in mind.
I:1982;2539;displayed the power struggle between Tony and Stane, eventually culminating into a violent clash .
I:1982;2540;with CGI special effects, of course .
I:1982;2541;[We must accord our thanks to the ingenuity and inventiveness of the team from Stan Wilson Studios.]
I:1982;2542;in fact, the most fascinating gadget in the movie, to me at least, was the flash.
I:1982;2543;I would love to have one of that.
I:1982;2544;did I enjoy watching the movie at the end?
I:1982;2545;Yes, especially the action sequences and witty dialogue.
I:1982;2546;Was it worth spending the two hours in the movie theatre?
I:1982;2547;great movie, robert downey jr. as tony stark is a great performance and the direction was amazing.
I:1982;2548;If you are a fan of the Avengers, you will love this.
I:1982;2549;Great video, menus and extras, one of the best blu ray discs available.
I:1982;2550;If you like this kind of movie, this is a great story!
I:1982;2551;Robert Downey Jr. is an excellent actor, who brings depth to this character.
I:1982;2552;Mr. Downey is a good (fun to watch) actor.
I:1982;2553;I found Mr. D and Ms. Paltrow very winning (even when they are obviously winking at us).
I:1982;2554;Much LOUD effects and fantastic feats .
I:1982;2555;Great flick, Robert Downey is the man!
I:1982;2556;Like the action and the effects.
I:1982;2557;It was a gift for my son and he really loved it.
I:1982;2558;He just wanted to see the movie everyday at home.
I:1982;2559;Love all the casting, great pacing, very exciting, sometimes funny.
I:1982;2560;The CGI for the Iron Man Suit is absolutely perfect.
I:1982;2561;I brought this movie as a gift for my son.
I:1982;2562;"He loves this movie so much, that he says ""Ironman Rocks!"""
I:1982;2563;Its a great movie, a must see if you haven't.
I:1982;2564;I read good things about the new one coming out this year and read the praises of the first Iron Man.
I:1982;2565;"I love Robert Downey Jr. and he did a great job, as did Gweneth Paltrow (surprise
I:1982;2566;It's been a VERY long time since I've enjoyed a movie this much!Anyway, this movie was a winner from the get go.
I:1982;2567;It was entertaining and enjoyable right to the end.
I:1982;2568;Of course by now, everyone knows what a fantastic movie Iron Man is.
I:1982;2569;It's even more enjoyable on blu.
I:1982;2570;To me, it's still the best Marvel movie and I loved Thor and X. men First Class.
I:1982;2571;Something unique about Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal .
I:1982;2572;robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Tony Stark/Iron Man.
I:1982;2573;The cast is also amazing.
I:1982;2574;The plot is very interesting which makes Iron Man a great start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
I:1982;2575;there are a few scary scenes in this movie, so I recommend it for people over ten.
I:1982;2576;tje second disc was received in good shape.
I:1982;2577;Usually not an action movie type but I loved every minute of this movie.
I:1982;2578;Robert Downey, wild eyes and smart alec grin always make me want to watch more and keep watching.
I:1982;2579;Good special effects, Downey is excellent, Bridges was mis.
I:1982;2580;It says so right on the disc.
I:1982;2581;be mold and becomes truly fresh and worthwhile.
I:1982;2582;It mixes just the right amount of real world injustice and superhero magic.
I:1982;2583;It never becomes too slapstick, and Downey Jr.'s remarkable performance brings to life both the bitterness that makes Tony Stark a believable human being and the fortitude that leads him to make himself into Iron Man.
I:1982;2584;and that's what makes it great.
I:1982;2585;The best action movie ever!
I:1982;2586;Robert Downey Jr. is perfect in this role.
I:1982;2587;Great action that ties in with the rest of the series and more!
I:1982;2588;If you haven't seen it I highly recommend that you do.
I:1982;2589;Condition of the Video: I received this as a Christmas present.
I:1982;2590;Usually the videos are fine from here.
I:1982;2591;Movie Review: I've seen the movie before and liked the beginning to the middle.
I:1982;2592;I absolutely loved this movie!
I:1982;2593;I went to go see it the weekend it came out and I enjoyed it so much!
I:1982;2594;My husband and I laughed, not in a good way, at the action scenes in the end and earlier when Pepper Potts helped Tony Stark change the device in his chest.
I:1982;2595;looks great im waiting on my blu.
I:1982;2596;Its always awesome to see actor's clean up their routine and come out back on top
I:1982;2597;Great film that modernizes Iron Man's story (comic fans know his original story is from the '60s).
I:1982;2598;The movie is great, the packaging is cool, the extras are great.
I:1982;2599;Amazing movie, action packed, and exciting.
I:1982;2600;Robert Downey, Jr. has great comedic timing and sense of sarcasm, yet you also see him develop a sensitivity towards what is really being done with the weapons his character develops.
I:1982;2601;You've never really seen him as a villain, so this is an interesting turn for him.
I:1982;2602;A very well done movie, and looking forward to the next one.
I:1982;2603;Iron man was one of the best as a kid, and this movie does it justice.
I:1982;2604;great effects, Mavel Studio's knows how to make the action picture.
I:1982;2605;Continues to show his brilliance, and Gweneth is the perfect too tall Pepper Potts.
I:1982;2606;This is a great techno action movie.
I:1982;2607;Very intertaining, and from the movies our next technology come!
I:1982;2608;Good action superhero movie, very slick and very hollywood.
I:1982;2609;ray edition, and it is fantastic.
I:1982;2610;Thirty years later, Robert Downey, Jr. is now entertaining my kids too.
I:1982;2611;Sure it had it's funny moments as Stark builds his second Iron Man suit as well as one good action sequence once the suit was completed.
I:1982;2612;We love the Iron Man series and the extras on the second disc in this set are fun to watch.
I:1982;2613;Iron Man has a lot of talent behind it and can be very entertaining.
I:1982;2614;He perfects this suit into the Iron Man we know and love in the movie.
I:1982;2615;Pepper Pots is a great servant and a very pretty woman whom he ignores as often as he can.
I:1982;2616;Terrence Howard gets to play the sidekick in a fun way.
I:1982;2617;This is an ironclad winner!
I:1982;2618;Good plot excellent special effects .
I:1982;2619;part of the Avengers super.
I:1982;2620;"hero group, Ironman and Captain America are two best ""singles"" of the series."
I:1982;2621;this is a great addition to my marvel blu.
I:1982;2622;worth adding to your marvel blu.
I:1982;2623;It was a great movie it had many moments of action and suspence to make it a great movie for me and my family.
I:1982;2624;This movie is really, really great!
I:1982;2625;Its super funny, action filled and has a great story line.
I:1982;2626;I actually saw it twice in the theater.
I:1982;2627;awesome movie i loved the plot and the characters the acting was great its deff a movie to watch with the fam!!!
I:1982;2628;This play on Tony Stark's role on this movie is simply perfect, and he's done better on Iron Man 2!!!
I:1982;2629;It was the best hero movie on the year it was released, no doubt about it, even though some people wants to claim Dark Knight the best.
I:1982;2630;This was a great movie.
I:1982;2631;Awesome story, awesome acting, great special effects and who doesn't love a superhero?!
I:1982;2632;This looked great on blu.
I:1982;2633;If you want to have a good time, this is a good picture and a very good come back for Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;2634;the graphics are great though!
I:1982;2635;Robert Downey, Jr. is awesome.
I:1982;2636;Special effects are really cool.
I:1982;2637;Came timely and arrived earlier than I thought it would.
I:1982;2638;My sister is going to love her gifts this year.
I:1982;2639;Is spot on as Tony Stark.
I:1982;2640;an amazing movie,a lot of special effects.
I:1982;2641;good movie,to spend on the weekend with friends
I:1982;2642;I love this movie, and it helps that my wife also loves it.
I:1982;2643;Robert Downey Jr. was always a favorite of mine, and i was so happy to hear that he was clean and doing movies again!
I:1982;2644;This movie might be the best looking blu.
I:1982;2645;ray I own, or atleast in the top five.
I:1982;2646;worth watching over and over again.
I:1982;2647;Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a genius with technology.
I:1982;2648;He is wealthy beyond imagination, and lives the playboy life to a hilt, spending as much time as possible drinking, gambling, and pursuing anything in a skirt.
I:1982;2649;After three months in captivity, Stark manages to escape.
I:1982;2650;He returns home determined to change the direction of his company.
I:1982;2651;What we do get in the way of action scenes are wonderful and had me on the edge of my seat.
I:1982;2652;And the robot assistants were very funny, proving a nice balance to some of the darker moments.
I:1982;2653;They all did the best job they could making the thin characters come to life.
I:1982;2654;If you enjoy Marvel movies than this is one you need to add to your collection as well as #2.
I:1982;2655;So far, one of the best superhero movies made!
I:1982;2656;I love Robert Downey Jr. in this role.
I:1982;2657;The CGI is first rate and it has good action with subtle humor.
I:1982;2658;This movie is probably the best superhero ever created!
I:1982;2659;I recommend it for anyone who loves the Marvel franchise of movies.
I:1982;2660;Yes indeed, when I was 14 I wanted to be a genius and rich, and invent a matter.
I:1982;2661;gravity machine so I could fly all over the world and fight evil.
I:1982;2662;I also wanted a gorgeous and loyal girlfriend, but had little idea of exactly what I would do with her other than gaze longingly.
I:1982;2663;The movie shows a profound understanding of the early teenage boy.
I:1982;2664;The process of designing and manufacturing this item was outstanding.
I:1982;2665;The movie was action packed and I enjoyed every moment, although the fight with the large suit of his enemy was a little overdone, but it's just a movie.
I:1982;2666;Everyone plays their parts perfectly to such an extent that I can't picture anyone else playing them.
I:1982;2667;Story is totally cohesive and editing is fantastic.
I:1982;2668;Either way the bass effects are truly outstanding.
I:1982;2669;Iron Man is one of my favorite superhero movies.
I:1982;2670;Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as Tony Stark.
I:1982;2671;I like what he brings to the character in terms of maturity and intelligence.
I:1982;2672;This is a movie I have watched many times!
I:1982;2673;That's the bridge that allows Stark's genius to take over and fashion his armor with the heart, as an outpatient.
I:1982;2674;Cybernetic science and technology has truly come a long way, too.
I:1982;2675;Ironman is right up there with the other heroes.
I:1982;2676;Yet he seems closer to being human than the others.
I:1982;2677;Whatever the case Robert Downey Jr. did a great job.
I:1982;2678;There is a lot to `give away' in describing Iron Man', but suffice it to say that the film makers have created the real Tony Stark.
I:1982;2679;The cinematography is stunning in Blu.
I:1982;2680;ray and the scenes starting from Afghanistan to Los Angeles's skies are over.
I:1982;2681;The action is intense, funny, witty and true to the character of the comic book character.
I:1982;2682;Plus, it is all believable.
I:1982;2683;Robert Downing, Jr. playing around with his Iron Man invention is nothing short of hilarious and thrilling.
I:1982;2684;The effects are fantastic, the storyline is fast and clever and it is no small wonder it broke box office records.
I:1982;2685;the details, color and sound are that amazing!
I:1982;2686;The initial PLAY/SCENES board is a colorful statue of Iron Man with colorful, comic book scientific looking diagrams.
I:1982;2687;There are some great extras like the `Hall of Armor' showing all four Iron Man designs, `The Invincible Iron man' and deleted scenes.
I:1982;2688;These deletions are great, including, 'I Am Iron Man', `Visuals Effects of Iron Man', a fantastic `Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;2689;He loves the movie and mimicks Ironman's actions.
I:1982;2690;This is a good put together movie.
I:1982;2691;The beginning was very well done.
I:1982;2692;i really liked the movie.
I:1982;2693;Found it interesting and informative.
I:1982;2694;Would recommend to anyone who enjoys this field of adventure movies.
I:1982;2695;(shows intellect to speak without necessity of using four letter vocabulary that talks down to audience!)
I:1982;2696;The actors were real, and were human about their roles.
I:1982;2697;The humor was great, the CGI felt so realistic (visually, you couldn't tell that it had CGI).
I:1982;2698;The sound and music went great together.
I:1982;2699;It's this energy that powers your suit.
I:1982;2700;this movie is packed with fabulous actors: Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Howard, and Paul Bettany as the voice for Stark's butler, Jarvis.
I:1982;2701;man movies and just up there with Batman Begins.
I:1982;2702;Everything about it is top.
I:1982;2703;Some of the best comedic moments are between Tony Stark and his robot assistance as he builds his updated Iron Man suit.
I:1982;2704;The creativity found in this movie was astounding.
I:1982;2705;Everything is crisp and great looking.
I:1982;2706;Iron Man accomplishes what I heretofore thought was impossible: it makes the first act of the hero's origin story (before he attains his powers) the most enjoyable part of a comic book movie.
I:1982;2707;tony Stark is a guiltless hedonist living the ultimate playboy lifestyle with narcissistic charm and dexterity.
I:1982;2708;His performance hits you like a shot of pure oxygen.
I:1982;2709;He is the slick, supercool badass with snappy one.
I:1982;2710;There's a scene where this happens and it's the last time Iron Man provides a refreshing antidote to the typical mundane style of storytelling prevalent in Marvel's blockbuster features.
I:1982;2711;Man was this a great movie.
I:1982;2712;I knew Dark Knight was going to be good but this one.
I:1982;2713;Robert Downey Jr is just the best Stark for this movie.
I:1982;2714;One of the best movies of all time to see.
I:1982;2715;The acters or great and Robert Downey Jr. played iron man perfectly.
I:1982;2716;Although this character has never been a first rank superhero, it is still entertaining to watch him fight for justice, as well as observing how the main character manages to handle his inner conflicts.
I:1982;2717;I rolled my eyes the first time I saw his name a year or so ago when I found out about this movie being made.
I:1982;2718;But let me tell you right now.
I:1982;2719;He's got this role down.
I:1982;2720;At first I thought he was a total jerk at the beginning, but then realized it's just his way of being funny, and it's absolutely fantastic.
I:1982;2721;Through the whole movie Rob will have you laughing quite a bit.
I:1982;2722;He's not only funny, but he's also quite laid back with his genius.
I:1982;2723;The son of Howard Stark, also a genius.
I:1982;2724;He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it.
I:1982;2725;I don't know how to explain it, but it looked great.
I:1982;2726;also the action scenes were great.
I:1982;2727;I think one of the biggest reasons why they were so good is that they were used sparingly.
I:1982;2728;Which in turn helps the story out, because it helped give us that character development that a lot of people complain about in these Marvel movies.
I:1982;2729;whatever', and she did a really good job.
I:1982;2730;Paltrow in a supporting role, instead of a lead, is a much better combination, in my opinion.
I:1982;2731;in the end, I think everyone will enjoy this movie.
I:1982;2732;Go take a second loan out so you can pay for gas, movie tickets, and popcorn and coke (maybe some twizzlers if you go donate some blood first) and enjoy a day at the movies!
I:1982;2733;See how cool it is to actually see what the heck is going on during his fight scenes?
I:1982;2734;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:1982;2735;The series has been well done.
I:1982;2736;You will enjoy all three movies.
I:1982;2737;"It's got the excitement, danger, and the touch of romance that represents the ""good movie"", all with a lead actor that knows what he's doing."
I:1982;2738;For me, there's nothing better in the world than a main character that undergoes genuine change, a character you actually care about through and through!
I:1982;2739;"rounded a character as can be, one moment making you laugh and another bringing tears to your eyes through his self realizations, risks, and of course his banter with his personal assistant, the ""famous"" Pepper Pots."
I:1982;2740;The superhero kicks major buttocks!!
I:1982;2741;I was very surprised by this movie though.
I:1982;2742;I'm not much of a fan of the superhero films, but I quite honestly enjoyed this film.
I:1982;2743;it's for the older and young fans of the superhero fan.
I:1982;2744;I think this was a good choice for the price and the movie.
I:1982;2745;I couldn't afford the 2 disc version, but it was every bit as entertaining as I would like it to be.
I:1982;2746;It still had extras that I like to see.
I:1982;2747;A great action packed movie plus a little bit more!
I:1982;2748;i enjoyed the movie greatly and its characters and story development (and the acting by Robert Downey Jr. was awesome!)
I:1982;2749;I was surprised but I really did like this movie and recommend it to anyone.
I:1982;2750;from the impressive beginning, you know that Iron Man is going to work.
I:1982;2751;Not only is Robert perfect for the Tony Stark/Iron Man role, he's cute as well.
I:1982;2752;He has a fancy house, and a love for women.
I:1982;2753;When the terrorists force Tony to reproduce the weapon, he builds an impressive suit of armour, and escapes.
I:1982;2754;the special effects and technology used in this movie will absolutely blow you away.
I:1982;2755;the supporting cast was amazing.
I:1982;2756;Gwyneth played the part for Pepper really well, and even managed to run a little in skyscraper heels.
I:1982;2757;And for all those reviewers who have complained that Samuel L Jackson is listed in the cast, but doesn't appear .
I:1982;2758;I'll give you a hint.
I:1982;2759;Put it this way, there will definitely be a sequel.
I:1982;2760;all I can say is go see this movie.
I:1982;2761;Got it for a Christmas gift for the hubby and he loved it!!
I:1982;2762;Great Movie I'd deff reccomend it!
I:1982;2763;I have always loved the Iron Man trilogy.
I:1982;2764;it's most excellent, and Robert Downey Jr adds that special touch to them.
I:1982;2765;I bought this for my fiance and he's enjoyed every second of the extra footage (not to mention the amazing Iron Man)!
I:1982;2766;i always love these movies.
I:1982;2767;I am not into the special features and whatnot, so this is perfect for me.
I:1982;2768;Iron Man stars the irresistible Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a rich weapons designer who eventually ends up captured by terrorists in Afghanistan.
I:1982;2769;Stark manages to invent a bionic suit made of iron and escape from his captors, although the experience leads to a shift in his business strategy and an ultimate showdown with his longtime business partner (Jeff Bridges).
I:1982;2770;driven movie, which sets it apart from your average run.
I:1982;2771;Downey is charming and absolutely perfectly cast in this role, and he has amazing chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays Stark's assistance/platonic love interest, Pepper.
I:1982;2772;This is one of his best moviesLots of action and very good special effects
I:1982;2773;Watched it because some friends said it was pretty good.
I:1982;2774;The suppler did what was expected and the price was great .
I:1982;2775;Once again a Marvelcomic book hero has made a good movie.
I:1982;2776;He is in Afghanistan when hishelicopter is blown from the air and he is captured.
I:1982;2777;on the sly he builds an Iron Man suit.
I:1982;2778;He stages a daring escape.
I:1982;2779;He comes up with an instrument to help with this condition.
I:1982;2780;He returns to America and fine tunes his invention.
I:1982;2781;He decides to use his invention to fight the forces of evil.
I:1982;2782;The special effects used by Iron Man are breathtaking and fabulous.
I:1982;2783;This is a must see movie.
I:1982;2784;Thescene after the credits adds to the dimension of the movie.
I:1982;2785;ray presentation of Iron Man really pops and the clarity seems so off the charts.
I:1982;2786;It really brought new life to a film I have enjoyed for many years.
I:1982;2787;Great movie, although I found it hard to believe Robert Downey Jr was really in the suite all the time, I gave the film a thumbs up.
I:1982;2788;One of the greatest things about living in the digital age, is the MOVIES THAT CAN BE MADE!
I:1982;2789;This tried and true Stan Winston comic character comes alive in a very relevant, fun and exciting adventure.
I:1982;2790;and I mean everybody will love this film and like my family, wont be able to wait until the second installment.
I:1982;2791;metaldiva Sez: This is a movie you will watch over and over again.
I:1982;2792;oN A PERSONAL NOTE: Thank you Robert Downey Jr. for staying with us.
I:1982;2793;As a fan from way, way back I knew that you were a gifted actor and great human being and looked forward to the great things that I felt would come from you down the road.
I:1982;2794;Thankfully, you stayed, strayed and finally stayed for good.
I:1982;2795;Thank you for staying alive.
I:1982;2796;I love the newer superhero movies that are grounded in a more realistic reality.
I:1982;2797;This, the big screen debut of the character Iron Man, is fantastic.
I:1982;2798;I love the build up, showing how Tony Stark goes thru the process of becoming Iron Man.
I:1982;2799;I loved iron man so much that I got it in digital format.
I:1982;2800;Witch means it eats up my data package.
I:1982;2801;This is a great action packed movie.
I:1982;2802;The best to be produced by Marvel Studios
I:1982;2803;ray after you pop it in.
I:1982;2804;after about an hour and a half, I was able to watch this movie though.
I:1982;2805;It's a really great movie.
I:1982;2806;It's right up there with WALL*E and The Dark Knight.
I:1982;2807;It has a very fun comic book feel to it, while not being absurdly stupid.
I:1982;2808;If you can suspend your disbelief for 120 some odd minutes, it's a great ride.
I:1982;2809;robert Downey Jr. is a great Tony Stark.
I:1982;2810;"When I first heard he was cast as Iron Man, I thought ""yeah right!"
I:1982;2811;He pulls off the ladies man/billionaire playboy/hot shot role very well.
I:1982;2812;The poses/angles they choose and CGI work are all great.
I:1982;2813;This is a first rate production.
I:1982;2814;also, I didn't know who his assistant was before the credits rolled but she looked familiar (Turns out it was Gwyneth Paltrow) and she made a really interesting character too, for a supporting role.
I:1982;2815;the Movie Gets 5 Stars for great execution .
I:1982;2816;cast/acting, storyline, effects, and action scenes.
I:1982;2817;Dare I say: This is the best Marvel Comics movie to date.
I:1982;2818;It was the best Marvel movie I have ever saw.
I:1982;2819;2008 gave us three excellent superhero films: The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk.
I:1982;2820;It is soooo faithful to the origin of the character, despite modernizing certain elements, which i was totally fine with, since it made total sense: Instead of Vietnam, we see Stark captured in Afghanistan.
I:1982;2821;We see Stark's interaction and subsequent friendship with fellow inventor/prisoner Yinsen, well played by Grant Toub.
I:1982;2822;Downey has him down pat and his transformation from selfish, wealthy jerk to a slowly caring humanitarian/hero is peppered with humor and wit.
I:1982;2823;This is the only time i can say i enjoyed watching her on screen, and shes actually fun to watch in her playful interactions with Downey.
I:1982;2824;tight direction from Favreau, a great screenplay, excellent special effects and a fun, multi.
I:1982;2825;faceted performance from the multi.
I:1982;2826;"talented Downey makes ""Iron Man"" one of the better superhero adaptations to come along in a while."
I:1982;2827;This is the role that Downey Jr. was born to play!
I:1982;2828;Everybody cast was perfect from Terrance Howard as Tony Stark's military friend, to Gwyneth Paltrow as a very sexy version of Pepper Potts (Stark's fawning and overprotective Administrative Assistant).
I:1982;2829;stark is a wild playboy genius who reminds me of the Mozart character in Amadeus.
I:1982;2830;the action is great and Iron Man's suit is very believable.
I:1982;2831;It is amazing to see Stark dressed by robot helpers and to see how the armor goes on.
I:1982;2832;This movie is action packed from start to finish.
I:1982;2833;This movie has raised the bar thanks to the acquisition of Marvel by Disney.
I:1982;2834;if you are a Marvel comics fans, or if you just love great action movies then you will love this one.
I:1982;2835;Both the acting and the special effects are top.
I:1982;2836;He had no true evil adversary to boost his skill level alot more so all we are left with is admiring his suit which was very cool.
I:1982;2837;Big budget advertising and the good box office receipts still don't impress me as I am very well versed on all these characters and see the holes very well.
I:1982;2838;which forces them to take more chances and be more creative in the action and plots.
I:1982;2839;"And finally, let the fellas ""get some"" please?!!"
I:1982;2840;Better than the new Hulk but not that much.
I:1982;2841;I rate it a C. Thanks Again Ya'll!!
I:1982;2842;I love the move but I have a big screen TV and the picture doesnt' cover the hole screen.
I:1982;2843;This is a great move it needs to be seen on the entire screen.
I:1982;2844;I think the writers did a good job of taking the best of IM and play a bit with his origin, but it worked mostly.
I:1982;2845;It looks alot better than the other version and this is great movie.
I:1982;2846;Everyone in it does a fantastic jobthat makes this a awesome movie that is everything a blockbuster should be: Entertaining, fine acting, a solid story, brilliant effects ,and it has characters that are well rounded.
I:1982;2847;And jeff bridges who makes a fine villian in this story.
I:1982;2848;He was always underestimated as a actor and this movie lets him create a believable slimy villian who might be working in any organization.
I:1982;2849;The movies have finally caught up to my old 1960's comic books in their ability to depict great fantasy heroes.
I:1982;2850;I really enjoyed this movie, non.
I:1982;2851;Good acting, writing, and directing.
I:1982;2852;If you enjoy superhero movies you have to own this one, on Blu Ray the sound and picture are 10 times more enjoyable than the standard definition version of this movie.
I:1982;2853;It is a great movie, it is a great movie, it is a great movie, it is a great movie
I:1982;2854;by now everyone knows the story of Iron Man: alcoholic weapons.
I:1982;2855;Vanity Fair reporters show up at important news conferences.
I:1982;2856;"And the entire premise of Iron Man revolves around ""repulsor lift"" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity."
I:1982;2857;When I first saw Iron Man in the theaters, it was easily one of my favorite movies.
I:1982;2858;But I think the average Joe will enjoy them as well.
I:1982;2859;Spend the few extra bucks for this one.
I:1982;2860;Great plot, even if you never read the comic book you up to speed from the begining!
I:1982;2861;I saw this in the movies and loved it, and I loved it all over again at home, especially with all of the extra features.
I:1982;2862;He is in many ways similar 2 Bruce Wayne/Batman(he's rich, a genius, runs a huge corporation, and in his spare time fights the bad guys in a really sweet costume).
I:1982;2863;Now I'm a HUGE Batman fan and I think Batman fans will love this movie and see the similarities and Differences Btween Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark.
I:1982;2864;My favorite scenes in the movie R when he is trying 2 test the parts 2 his suit.
I:1982;2865;'s ability 2 be funny(even though he was getting tossed around the room a lot).
I:1982;2866;man punch a lot of people around I will agree that this movie was indeed one of the best summer movies I've ever scene.
I:1982;2867;I recommend this movie to all Scifi fans who also enjoy marvel commics.
I:1982;2868;And its nice to know that more Iron Man is coming in 2010.
I:1982;2869;Injured in the kidnapping, he finds a n irremovable piece of shrapnel in his chest.
I:1982;2870;He must wear an electromagnet to keep it from piercing his heart.
I:1982;2871;Stark has other plans, and is able to fashion a suit of armor that allows him to escape captivity.
I:1982;2872;"Iron Man is a great film, and as a superhero film it rates up there with ""Batman Begins"" and ""Spider."
I:1982;2873;It has action, drama, fumor, and great special effects.
I:1982;2874;Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired casting.
I:1982;2875;Iron Man is a great movie for all ages.
I:1982;2876;A decent movie but nothing to RAVE about.
I:1982;2877;excellent movie wow love it, the effects are awesome and im a big fan of ironman so yea movie is cool!!!
I:1982;2878;There was also a Star Trek Voyager download I never managed to get.
I:1982;2879;always was the best super hero.
I:1982;2880;There can be a run of very good ones, followed by a lot of clunkers.
I:1982;2881;robert Downey Jr does a great job with the role of Tony Stark.
I:1982;2882;playing him as brash, crass and arrogant, but with a strong ethical streak as well.
I:1982;2883;It is fairly straight forward as an origin story goes for a superhero.
I:1982;2884;A lot of special effects, action and explosions.
I:1982;2885;the 2 disc blu ray version of the movie gives you a lot of special features.
I:1982;2886;The trailers, behind the scenes and making of material, cast interviews etc.
I:1982;2887;Definitely worth adding to your collection if you get the discs, or just watching if you like the genre.
I:1982;2888;Robert Downey Jr. shines, and is perfect for the role of Tony Stark.
I:1982;2889;i am a big fan of superhero movies, and strongly believe that this one delivered.
I:1982;2890;Notable is the amazing detail on the intricate body armor and electronic systems of the suit.
I:1982;2891;You really believe that the suit (Stark's invention) is formidable and ultra high tech.
I:1982;2892;There is plenty of action, and some unbelievably cool moments that will have you hitting the rewind button, or watching the whole movie again soon.
I:1982;2893;I give it a full five stars.
I:1982;2894;ray player, and waited all this time until I saw it in Blu.
I:1982;2895;ray format, and again WOW.
I:1982;2896;What a great movie from begining to end!
I:1982;2897;Great Story Line, Great Cast, So Much Action!!!!
I:1982;2898;This was a the perfect choice to start off the entire super hero Avengers saga.
I:1982;2899;After watching this movie you will want an Iron Man suit for yourself!
I:1982;2900;The director and acting in this film brought Stan Lee's legendary Iron Man to life in this outstanding film!
I:1982;2901;This film will herald the beginning of realism of comic book characters onto film!
I:1982;2902;paced and the scenes action packed.
I:1982;2903;Her delivery was fine, but I don'tcare for her flat, deadpan affect.
I:1982;2904;Iron Man is one of the best comic book adaptations to find its way to the big screen.
I:1982;2905;This is a good thing.
I:1982;2906;"I think it would be generous to call director Jon Favreau's previous work ""mediocre"", but I have to admit that ""Iron Man"" is a triumph."
I:1982;2907;Favreau even successfully dealt with the challenge of making it interesting to watch someone build a machine or look at a computer screen.
I:1982;2908;The key is that Stark is able to converse with his computer and make pithy comments to his robot while working.
I:1982;2909;"Plus there is a short but sweet Easter Egg (2 min) in which ""Iron Man"" co. creator Stan Lee talks about Robert Downey Jr. and his cameo appearance in the film."
I:1982;2910;Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, French.
I:1982;2911;It takes you through a man's epiphany of his role in a destructive system to his initiation of a system of protection and justice.
I:1982;2912;He proves it by being a believable playboy genius who grows up fast under some great pain and duress when, on a trip to Afghanistan, he becomes a prisoner.
I:1982;2913;fiend becomes a man with a. heart.
I:1982;2914;the second star of the movie is the special effects for the suit.
I:1982;2915;riddled youth into something cool and effective and.
I:1982;2916;"the effect of his ""heart"" is also quite nifty, though less complex."
I:1982;2917;The robot helper is a hoot.
I:1982;2918;key, strong, and effective in his role with very few lines.
I:1982;2919;He even manages to be funny.
I:1982;2920;the sets work very well.
I:1982;2921;And I do believe it's a Gehry structure in one scene (or a great facsimile of one.)
I:1982;2922;The reactor is displayed as a wonderful visual nod to the retro science fiction some of us still remember with great nostalgia.
I:1982;2923;the direction is quite good: It has energy like mad when it needs it.
I:1982;2924;It works with Downey's face and buffed.
I:1982;2925;up bod in some highly potent close.
I:1982;2926;and it'll make fans of a particularly cool Hollywood actor holler.
I:1982;2927;Now I'll count the weeks until Iron Man II comes out.
I:1982;2928;I have the old Iron Man comic that tells the origin story, and I'm gonna go read it and see how it compares.
I:1982;2929;Enjoyed this movie as a family.
I:1982;2930;Lots of action and the whole family totally enjoyed viewing this prime time movie.
I:1982;2931;We are a large family (9 of us), and all of us enjoy superhero movies.
I:1982;2932;My husband is a comic book geek, and we have all learned about the DC and Marvel universes via osmosis.
I:1982;2933;In other words, we know our comic book heroes.
I:1982;2934;This movie has the rare mixture of a comic book feel, great story, characters you care about, AND.
I:1982;2935;The Director was wise enough to let Downey do what he does best.
I:1982;2936;He is a natural comedian, and added just enough humor to turn an ok role into a work of art.
I:1982;2937;paltrow ended up being a good choice as well.
I:1982;2938;She is like wallpaper most of the movie, present, but not overwhelming.
I:1982;2939;This allows Downey to stay in the spotlight where he belongs.
I:1982;2940;Mind you, there are many other good movies.
I:1982;2941;MArvel has stepped it up a notch.
I:1982;2942;One of the best hero movies I've seen.
I:1982;2943;This is one of my favorites next to the Batman movies!
I:1982;2944;This is a great film, and certainly my favorite of all the recent comic book adaptations.
I:1982;2945;The main character is great to watch because of his personality, him not being a typical clean super hero.
I:1982;2946;There are some great funny moments and the effects are great.
I:1982;2947;ray and with loads of extra features unlike a lot of Blu.
I:1982;2948;Iron Man is a very interesting and well thought out character study about Tony Stark.
I:1982;2949;We see Stark's transition from a rich playboy, to a relatable person that wants to help people.
I:1982;2950;That's mostly got to do with Robert Downey Jr. playing Stark.
I:1982;2951;the characters are all good especially Tony.
I:1982;2952;Pepper Potts is also a good love interst for Tony.
I:1982;2953;They have good chemestry together (atleast in this movie).
I:1982;2954;Obadiah Stane is also a good villian, and is a good repesentation of coporate greed.
I:1982;2955;the effects in the film from the Iron Man suit to Tony's workshop are all great.
I:1982;2956;The fight scenes, for the most part, are cool and entertaining.
I:1982;2957;overall this movie is a must see for superhero fans, and just movie fans in general.
I:1982;2958;com, filled the order right away with no delay, it was packed very well and arrived in perfect playing condition, which was my main concern.
I:1982;2959;Based on this order I can highly recommend capcityoutlet and would order from them again.
I:1982;2960;This was an excellent movie.
I:1982;2961;"The colors are so vibrant and you can see ever little detail on our 52"" Sony Bravia."
I:1982;2962;This is worth every penny!
I:1982;2963;Now this is how to make a summer movie.
I:1982;2964;Iron Man explodes off the screen with a combustible mix of superstar charisma, heavy metal thunder and the one thing other film's of it ilk willfully forget: soul.
I:1982;2965;dry wit, magnetic charm and, ultimately, huge amounts of heart.
I:1982;2966;At first, Stark is a willing and content cog in the military industrial complex, reaping huge profits from the sale of self.
I:1982;2967;Paltrow is doing some the best work of her career as Stark's romantic equal.
I:1982;2968;"The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is palpable, sexy and resonant
I:1982;2969;Conscience awakened, he works to design a new prototype under the nose of those who hold him captive.
I:1982;2970;Favreau stages the escape with high impact pow, showing that this film might be battle cry of one of the next great directors.
I:1982;2971;suits rampaging across Southern California, is a doozy.
I:1982;2972;It's how it seamlessly integrates those elements into a resonant popcorn yarn that stands with the best of the best.
I:1982;2973;It turned out to be entertaining and at the end I enjoyed the film.
I:1982;2974;Good special effects, nice story line for actions and comics .
I:1982;2975;Extremely entertaining and a movie you can watch over and over again (which my son does).
I:1982;2976;It is very well done!
I:1982;2977;We really enjoyed the story and all the special effects.
I:1982;2978;I think they did a good job keeping it as close to the comics as a movie can.
I:1982;2979;iron Man was well balanced between comic relief and emotional drama.
I:1982;2980;i enjoyed it, well, then again I am in my early 20s :.]
I:1982;2981;I had high hopes going in given the amazing critic reviews and I was not let down in any way.
I:1982;2982;Robert Downey Jr. lays down a great performance that easily ranks as one of the best ever in this genre of film.
I:1982;2983;He is funny, smart, cool and just a unique individual.
I:1982;2984;The supporting cast from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeff Bridges are in fine form as well.
I:1982;2985;While The Dark Knight looks to be the film to beat this summer, Iron Man is truly a worthy foe.
I:1982;2986;Now bring on the Iron Man 2!
I:1982;2987;One of the best movies made over the past decade.
I:1982;2988;Whether you're a comic book person or not, you'll enjoy this action flick.
I:1982;2989;This is targeted for young people as well as adults, but it has scenes that are completely innapropriate for young teenagers.
I:1982;2990;i was hoping for an enjoyable hero movie, like Batman Begins, but instead it started with a bedroom sex scene only masked by a sheet.
I:1982;2991;headed for a teen movie.
I:1982;2992;OK, I'm the Iron Man.
I:1982;2993;stars for the great special.
I:1982;2994;"figures
I:1982;2995;I am sure we will see Robert Downey Jr. promoting sexual.
I:1982;2996;Nowhere do we see Robert Downey Jr. show a change of heart.
I:1982;2997;I love all the marvel movies and this one has a comedic and serious side to it!
I:1982;2998;Exciting and fun are another two.
I:1982;2999;Robert Downey Jr. was nothing but excellent at playing Iron Man.
I:1982;3000;He exhibited wit, intelligence, that playboy charm and charisma: the works for a superhero.
I:1982;3001;Although the plot was not strong, and there were a few holes or weak areas, the movie was excellent.
I:1982;3002;This is an origin story and it was all about the characters, they are the ones that move the story forward.
I:1982;3003;jeff Bridges was one cold blooded arms dealer, and he was great at it.
I:1982;3004;Paltrow was cute in her very capable performance.
I:1982;3005;But the story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man, and it was good.
I:1982;3006;The action sequences and the special effects were excellent but did not dominate the film, which I was grateful form.
I:1982;3007;The action and special effects are enough to keep the movie going and highly entertaining, but the character development is what drives it forward, what gives it form and meaning.
I:1982;3008;This movie is a must see, it is fun, funny as well, and has excellent performances.
I:1982;3009;Lots of action, exploding sound effects, wonderful plot, characters, etc.
I:1982;3010;This was a very good movie with some great acting involved.
I:1982;3011;One that I wont mind seeing again.
I:1982;3012;This is a awesome movie and Robert Downey Jr is the one and only Iron Man.
I:1982;3013;He does a excellent job playing Tony Stark.
I:1982;3014;Back to Iron Man, the blu ray version looks very nice and was well worth the upgrade.
I:1982;3015;I enjoy the story line of IM1 a little more than IM2.
I:1982;3016;The action in this movie is fantastic and the CGI is incredible!
I:1982;3017;I think the CGI along with Downey's performance is what really makes this movie believable.
I:1982;3018;Fast delivery great product good price well worth it.
I:1982;3019;For general entertainment this is a very good choice.
I:1982;3020;It has none of the edge of say, Dark Knight, but it has humor, and strikes a good balance between fantasy and taking itself (too) seriously.
I:1982;3021;The planned sequels are probably 3 deep, but there always room for this kind of fun.
I:1982;3022;This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where!
I:1982;3023;"Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a. k. a. Iron Man or ""ol' Shellhead""."
I:1982;3024;man films, it's the characters who are the stars and that's what makes the FX and super hero stuff work so well.
I:1982;3025;This is one of the best Superhero films since any of the Spider.
I:1982;3026;I actually may go see this again, something I never do, well I did see the first Spider.
I:1982;3027;I don't know if anyone noticed this, but Tony Stark's cell phone ring was the theme song melody from the 1960's Iron Man cartoon,(totally cool)I love little things like this!
I:1982;3028;'Iron Man' takes the heart of the 'Spider.
I:1982;3029;man' films and the believable techincal aspects from 'Batman Begins' and comes up with one entertaining knock out of a movie!A compelling story, a great cast, superb special effects and most of all it's FUN!
I:1982;3030;and stay through the credits for a great cameo setting up the next installment.
I:1982;3031;its a fun, enjoyable romp, that sets up the franchise.
I:1982;3032;Though Robert Downey Jr does such a wonderful job and his personallity really seems to come through on this character.
I:1982;3033;The movie is a combination of a good script (many times side.
I:1982;3034;lined in such movies) and very good special effects.
I:1982;3035;Robert Downey proved he is a good actor in this movie by getting in the right shape required and as usuall living the role.
I:1982;3036;Overall another Marvel hit which I'm sure will encourage Marvel to bring more and more of their superheros onto the big screen.
I:1982;3037;Real simple,,,Movie,,,Excellent!Robert Downey Jr's acting,,,Excellent!Blu.
I:1982;3038;"I really liked the ""extras"" that came with this disc."
I:1982;3039;It tells how the movie came into being.
I:1982;3040;This has got to be one of the best movies in a loooooong time.
I:1982;3041;Does the comic justice and the some.
I:1982;3042;It's a great plot with top shelf actors.
I:1982;3043;Watch before the rest of the series.
I:1982;3044;Just one of the best action adventure movies ever.
I:1982;3045;Fun for the whole family.
I:1982;3046;We love superheroes in our house!
I:1982;3047;ray with it's detailed color and super 5.1 Sur sound!
I:1982;3048;This is the best rock you fun movie to hit the home market.
I:1982;3049;ray is also super on classic films!
I:1982;3050;This movie is lean, solid entertainment.
I:1982;3051;It wastes no time, is well paced and smartly written with snappy dialogue and good subtext.
I:1982;3052;most importantly, this movie is FUN!
I:1982;3053;funny, smart and compelling to watch throughout.
I:1982;3054;It seems as though he's having more fun than should be legal ( I know, don't tempt him).
I:1982;3055;the effects are breathtaking, seamlessly switching from practical to cg without calling attention to artifice .
I:1982;3056;a major feat these days.
I:1982;3057;I totally bought that this guy could fly around in a high tech suit of armor.
I:1982;3058;gwyneth Paltrow is a pleasant surprise.
I:1982;3059;She looks really HOT!Terrence Howard is good as the straight man and there were a couple male.
I:1982;3060;jeff Bridges ( always a pleasure ) does a great job of taking his character from ambiguous manipulator to outright villain without any breaks in logic or motivation.
I:1982;3061;the movie balances humor, drama and action with a light tone while still managing a fairly serious subtext about war profiteering and global violence.
I:1982;3062;it all adds up to one of the most entertaining popcorn flicks around and a serious contender for 'best superhero movie' award.
I:1982;3063;For fans of the movie, I highly recommend the Blu.
I:1982;3064;financed film, Iron Man is a pure treat from start to finish.
I:1982;3065;Robert Downey Jr is perfectly cast as billionaire industrialist and weapons developer Tony Stark, and Jon Favreau is definitely the right man for the job in helming the film.
I:1982;3066;It's perfectly paced and pays wonderous homages to the classic comics that it's adapted from, all the while featuring an ending that have you simply salivating for what's to come not only in the realm of Iron Man, but of Marvel as a whole.
I:1982;3067;this is one of the funniest wittiest and most intelligent movies of the summer!
I:1982;3068;"Our villain has a believable motive
I:1982;3069;Iron Man also has a female sidekick who does know his true identity.
I:1982;3070;And best of all, our hero is not suffused with enough humility to keep his identity under wraps.
I:1982;3071;One of the best movies of the year.
I:1982;3072;Here's a movie that: moves briskly, has a bit of humor, and is a beautifully.
I:1982;3073;made and thrilling cinematic ride.
I:1982;3074;"interest choices)
I:1982;3075;this is a smartly made/directed, fun, and entertaining action movie.
I:1982;3076;Seen it 5 times, the best of the Iron Man Movies.
I:1982;3077;Good soild modernized version of the Iron Man Origin story.
I:1982;3078;Robert Downey Jr.'s best movie EVER!!!!
I:1982;3079;This is a great movie and a must have on Blu.
I:1982;3080;For any Iron Man fan, this is a must own!
I:1982;3081;i thought that this movie was good, but I was actually expecting it be a tad more spectacular.
I:1982;3082;i thought Robert Downey Jr. did a fabulous job.
I:1982;3083;Jeff Bridges chewed the scenery gloriously.
I:1982;3084;(He looks very ominous without his hair!)
I:1982;3085;Everything will benefit from strong performances at the core of the film, even if you think audiences are really only coming to see you blow stuff up.
I:1982;3086;I Loved this movie .
I:1982;3087;The CG animation, script and characters make this movie a highly enjoyable must have for people who enjoy action movies.
I:1982;3088;Marvel did a brilliant job bringing their comics to life and Robert Downey Jr did a fantastic job as Tony Stark.
I:1982;3089;the story is engaging, funny and fast.
I:1982;3090;I got this as a Christmas gift.
I:1982;3091;Nothing is as good as experiencing for the first time the excitement of a hero's genesis and development.
I:1982;3092;This film was perfect IMHO as it contained all the elements in perfect balance (plot, editing, humor, good character development, music, special effects).
I:1982;3093;Great movie with 2 discs!I get it from wholesale_deals, and it did come with the package of Iron Man Mask packaging.
I:1982;3094;Iron Man is a great movie!
I:1982;3095;The Iron Man movie is great and is fun to watch!
I:1982;3096;Amazing graphics in blue ray.
I:1982;3097;A must have for anyone who likes action movies or great graphics in movies.
I:1982;3098;A very, very well rounded movie.
I:1982;3099;The action and special effects were very well done.
I:1982;3100;Great writing, great actors and wonderful CGI.
I:1982;3101;I was never a comic book fan, but in the past decade Marvel has lured me into seeing what the big fascination has been all about.
I:1982;3102;When one franchise begins to falter (Spider Man) a new one comes onto the scene and takes everyone's breath away.
I:1982;3103;it is great entertainment and I'm looking forward to the next installment to the series.
I:1982;3104;eh, at least we got to see Jessica Alba, and even the last Spiderman came up really short, this was a very welcome surprise.
I:1982;3105;Robert Downey Jr. is excellent, as is Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow.
I:1982;3106;The story is very well executed.
I:1982;3107;I imagine the film could have been longer in order to add more dimension and back story, but this delivered the goods, and I look forward to the sequel.
I:1982;3108;Certainly watchable even for the non.
I:1982;3109;man franchise, is very good.
I:1982;3110;The supporting cast is excellent.
I:1982;3111;The story is true to the comic book.
I:1982;3112;The special effects are spectacular.
I:1982;3113;Marvel was wise to take the reins on this one.
I:1982;3114;I personally have never liked Downing, but he was quite good in this movie.
I:1982;3115;Some of the Marvel Comics do make up into a good action movie.
I:1982;3116;All of the other players were also good in their parts.
I:1982;3117;"By the ending,I must assume the producers intend to make a second ""Iron Man "", and I'm certain it will be well attended."
I:1982;3118;After seeing this movie , we all can agree that Robert Downey Jr not only was perfect for the role of Tony Starks, he also gave the man personality.
I:1982;3119;opinion: Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Starks.
I:1982;3120;Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as his assistant Pepper Potts and even though I had Michael Jai White in mind as Rhodes, Terrence Howard does just fine as the Colonel.
I:1982;3121;Jeff Bridges is in top form as Obadiah Stane.
I:1982;3122;Iron Man was the first superhero movie to come out in 2008 and it unexpectedly set the bar high for superhero movies in 2008.
I:1982;3123;Two thumbs all the way up.
I:1982;3124;longtime and loyal fans were very upset and the uninitiated millions who did not keep up with comics were simply unimpressed.
I:1982;3125;The first bastion of hope came in the form of a film adaptation of a rather unknown superhero.
I:1982;3126;The teaser trailer to Ironman created a tremendous amount of buzz.
I:1982;3127;They seemed to be almost transformed by the divine touch.
I:1982;3128;Casual movie goers seemed also excited and wanted to finally learn of this strange unpopular character.
I:1982;3129;Some people were skeptical, others hopeful of the movies success and impact.
I:1982;3130;By May of that year everyone got their answer.
I:1982;3131;Ironman opened to world wide acclaim and critical praise.
I:1982;3132;the movie was a qualified success and gave fans a new hero to rally behind.
I:1982;3133;Teenage angst was replaced with middle aged angst and Robert Downey delivered a very confident and nuanced character even before he strapped on the armor.
I:1982;3134;This incredibly kinetic and impossibly agile character was getting down and dirty in warzones that seemed straight out of CNN.
I:1982;3135;luckily this movie was a great primer for casual fans and had some of the biggest fan service of any of the superhero movies.
I:1982;3136;This movie had tremendous respect for the source material and any changes made in the movie really helped the story along without putting off the fans.
I:1982;3137;If anything, it improved the Ironman premise for this era.
I:1982;3138;Robert Downey Jr. does a great job of playing iron man.
I:1982;3139;watch the movie to the very end, including the credits.
I:1982;3140;A fun, witty, action movie that not only pleases iron man and comic book fans, but also the mass audience.
I:1982;3141;Robert Downey Jr is the perfect Tony Stark.
I:1982;3142;A gift for my 10 year old grandson who loves using the interactive components on his iPad.
I:1982;3143;A fun way to watch a movie.
I:1982;3144;i love watching it,its like being at the movies!
I:1982;3145;This is the best series of movies ever.
I:1982;3146;The movies are always enjoyable no matter how many times you watch them.
I:1982;3147;The Bottom Line:The positive word.
I:1982;3148;It has its moments and Downey can be funny.
I:1982;3149;wise, that you could easily argue it's a rehashing of the 80's classic: man is critically wounded, has a second life inside an impervious suit, finds out he was betrayed, has showdown with a similarly super.
I:1982;3150;Sure, the special effects are kinda' cool, but Robocop's is even more impressive, especially when you consider they did it the old.
I:1982;3151;And for true biting satire and gallows humor you can't beat it.
I:1982;3152;"That kind of ""black and white"" portrayal was odd."
I:1982;3153;It had an interesting story interspersed with approparite comedy.
I:1982;3154;For an origin story, it is well written save for a plot hole or two and very well acted and directed.
I:1982;3155;From beginning to the end credits (and you really have got to wait til the end of the credits or you miss the zinger) this is a really good movie.
I:1982;3156;Not great, but really good.
I:1982;3157;man is Robocop for young adults but Downey Jr actually puts on a worthwhile performance that overshadows when he puts on the suit.
I:1982;3158;Even with the suit on the flying through the sky moments are well worth the wait and while the fights and finale are kept on a somewhat small scale they are still good.
I:1982;3159;man delivers on an interesting balance of action and content.
I:1982;3160;All I know is I got a great price compared to others around.
I:1982;3161;A decent super hero flick.
I:1982;3162;it is easy to watch with very enjoyable graphics and a plot that is simple and also easy to follow.
I:1982;3163;"Robert Downey Jr. has done some good movies these past few years
I:1982;3164;His experimentation in the lab with his robots by his side, was particularly funny.
I:1982;3165;He delivers a somewhat cool, calm yet lackadaisical approach to things when the pressure is on.
I:1982;3166;He did everything right in this movie and I think that's why he's endeared millions more fans because of it.
I:1982;3167;This is a great movie and with number 3 coming out I wanted to rewatch the first two to refresh myself on the series.
I:1982;3168;I love all comic book movies, and this was one of my favorites.
I:1982;3169;Even my husband enjoyed it.
I:1982;3170;Robert Downey Jr., is awesome, and it was a pleasure to see Gwyneth Paltrow in there too.
I:1982;3171;ray the sound and visuals are fantastic!
I:1982;3172;"This is the ""Ultimate Edition"" in Target's special package."
I:1982;3173;It is very nice and in my opinion, a much better deal than the usual package.
I:1982;3174;I'm not a big fan of Downey, but this movie is fantastic.
I:1982;3175;stop action, and there was even a story line to go with it.
I:1982;3176;It was well acted, Gweneth Paltro preformed admirably.
I:1982;3177;I think of all the movies I've seen Robert Downey, Jr. in, this one is his very best.
I:1982;3178;I think he does a good Sherlock Holmes but this movie really shows his skills.
I:1982;3179;Love Robert Downey Jr in this movie!
I:1982;3180;Great action, plot and actors.
I:1982;3181;Also great movie for nearly all ages.
I:1982;3182;genius playboy weaponsmaker Tony Stark is ambushed and kidnapped.
I:1982;3183;Further design modifications and refinements lead Stark to a truly amazing concept which makes him a bonafide superhero.
I:1982;3184;Those involved took a pretty well.
I:1982;3185;popular comic book character and made it one of the most highly anticipated films in at least recent history.
I:1982;3186;My hat is off to them all for going beyond that and delivering such a fun and energizing movie.
I:1982;3187;With the volume of comic books being adapted to film, most people should be pretty used to that by now.
I:1982;3188;What that story does is form the environment in which the special effects can really shine.
I:1982;3189;And we'll see how Mr. Stark does against The Dark Knight later this summer.
I:1982;3190;The guy is just that great and believable.
I:1982;3191;"and I immediately thought ""oh great."
I:1982;3192;"ok it's that kind of movie!"""
I:1982;3193;ironicly the best acting in my opinion in this overrated Fantastic Four in a Ironman suite of a movie was Jeff Bridges.
I:1982;3194;I honestly thought the best part of the movie was when RDJ and Bridges spoke in front of the giant ARC reactor discussing Stark's decision to go away from making weapons.
I:1982;3195;one of the best tips I've read from writers like Harlan Ellison is that you have to leave cliffhangers, keep the audience or reader guessing to which direction a story will go.
I:1982;3196;That leaves them immersed and feeling like they are apart of it.
I:1982;3197;I felt I knew exactly what was going to happen throughout the entire movie.
I:1982;3198;ray copy is great, i just wish there were more bonus features.
I:1982;3199;The movie itself was great, Robert Downey Jr. is frigin epic.
I:1982;3200;I enjoyed so much I bought it on Blu.
I:1982;3201;This is the umpteenth time I've watched this movie and I've enjoyed every viewing.
I:1982;3202;Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as Tony Stark.
I:1982;3203;"fi action movies that are a cut above the pack, (""Sky Captain"",) plays Tony Stark's/Iron Man's assistant and possible love interest Pepper Potts, (can you believe that name?!)"
I:1982;3204;Morton Downy Jr. plays the lead in a film that transcends the comic genre.
I:1982;3205;"He portrays Tony Stark
I:1982;3206;All the core elements of the comic are there.
I:1982;3207;"Gweneth Paltrow was extraordinary as Pepper Potts
I:1982;3208;There's a surprise in store for you if you watch the end of the credits.
I:1982;3209;Was better in the theater .
I:1982;3210;Beginning grabs your attention and remains very interesting!
I:1982;3211;This movie is, without a doubt, one of the greatest comic.
I:1982;3212;This is truly a must see!
I:1982;3213;Robert Downey Jr is masterful and entertaining as Tony Stark.
I:1982;3214;First one I saw was The Avengers, so of course since I enjoyed that so much had to go and watch all the others!
I:1982;3215;Am not sorry I did, they are a fun ride.
I:1982;3216;Robert Downey Jr is wonderful as Iron Man.
I:1982;3217;Yeah, yeah, casting Robert Downey Jr was a perfect fit.
I:1982;3218;this is a good movie to watch more than once, whenever real life gets too serious.
I:1982;3219;Great special effects, good story line, liked the characters, lots of action.
I:1982;3220;Family thoroughly enjoyed watching it.
I:1982;3221;This movie was very good and the special effect was great.
I:1982;3222;Every scenes were interesting and exciting.
I:1982;3223;The characters are acting was good.
I:1982;3224;She is going to love it!
I:1982;3225;Great movie at home especially when you crank it up with your surround system.
I:1982;3226;Iron Man is an awesome film with great special effects!
I:1982;3227;Everybody did a great job and all the actors were casted perfectly.
I:1982;3228;Instead, he builds an armor suit so he can escape.
I:1982;3229;I love all of Iron Man's gadgets.
I:1982;3230;His other friend, Obadiah Stane betrays him and builds his own iron suit.
I:1982;3231;If you love action, and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!
I:1982;3232;love it love it and its a great movie, a big hit as gift they love it too!!!
I:1982;3233;its also a family movie.
I:1982;3234;A great movie beautifully rendered in Blu Ray.
I:1982;3235;I always enjoy that with those and without it you are just left to guess for yourself.
I:1982;3236;Though friends who do read the comic say it's close enough.
I:1982;3237;with all that, in my opinion, this movie was a great super hero movie.
I:1982;3238;I really loved the two new Batman movies but have heard some people argue that Begins was a little slow.
I:1982;3239;And let's be honest, it was Robert Downey Jr. being Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;3240;It was a perfect role for him.
I:1982;3241;He made the character believable.
I:1982;3242;that I didn't realize time had passed is the best compliment I can give this movie.
I:1982;3243;Great Story line and Superior graphics are hard to find in one movie.
I:1982;3244;This one does it with grace and dignity.
I:1982;3245;Very much enjoyed this movie.
I:1982;3246;I loved the special features as well.
I:1982;3247;Well done movie I love to watch over and over.
I:1982;3248;Great action and story line.
I:1982;3249;Interaction between characters is great.
I:1982;3250;I always wondered why talented R. d. jr.
I:1982;3251;Would want to get involved in a simple action movie, but this is a developed character and is challenging to an actor of his caliber.
I:1982;3252;Iron Man breathes new life into the Marvel movie universe.
I:1982;3253;while most marvel movies nowadays involve some young hero out trying to find himself while trying to save the city at the same time,Iron man takes a more sophisticated and more adult approach.
I:1982;3254;while there is a considerable amount of time dedicated to Tony Starks's Ingenuity i. e. building suit prototypes,weapons aand ect, good filmaking and an excellent script make this a rather enjoyable process.
I:1982;3255;any doubts about Robert Downey's acting are put to rest by this movie,as this by far is one of the strongest performances of the year.
I:1982;3256;iron Man is a rare breed of action film in many respects,a lack of pointless and graphic material ensures that anyone in the family can enjoy this film and a good script and plot round out any beliefs about this film being yet another hormone driven teenage flop.
I:1982;3257;I really enjoyed the engineering, thinking, and trial and error shown.
I:1982;3258;It really showed the humanity of Tony Stark, which was great to see.
I:1982;3259;this is a great movie to own and watch over and over.
I:1982;3260;Robert Downey Jr. does a surprisingly good job in this role.
I:1982;3261;The plot is believable and the special effects are very well crafted into the story.
I:1982;3262;I was glued to my seat during the entire movie.
I:1982;3263;It was a thrill to watch it while enjoying my own snacks.
I:1982;3264;My girlfriend and I loved this movie.
I:1982;3265;We were always on the edge of our chairs, until it was over.
I:1982;3266;Watch it, you will love it too.
I:1982;3267;What a great Blu Ray transfer!
I:1982;3268;I'll get to that in a minute, I want to talk about the movie.
I:1982;3269;This movie has some very nice plot twists that will keep the viewer engaged.
I:1982;3270;the movie is about a super smart guy, Tony Stark, who has enough money to be the typical playboy.
I:1982;3271;He has a solid work ethic that has abled him to live the life that he lives and love so much.
I:1982;3272;he's in Afghanistan taking a joy ride with the US Tropps, when all of a sudden his humvee his hit with weapons, weapons that he and his company made.
I:1982;3273;"Tony then take all of his drive and energy and makes ""Iron Man"" and uses it against the people that held him hostage."
I:1982;3274;Again, not everyone in the US Government is happy with him.
I:1982;3275;this movie has a lot of strengths to it.
I:1982;3276;He gives Stark a lot of charm and depth that we can't help to love.
I:1982;3277;Downey does a fantastic job!This has some pretty neat plot twists.
I:1982;3278;I don't want to say what they are, but they're very nice and will keep you glued to the movie.
I:1982;3279;the Blu Ray is fantastic!
I:1982;3280;It has crystal clear images and very life like.
I:1982;3281;It will give the viewer the experience as if they're really there.
I:1982;3282;I loved all of the extras to it.
I:1982;3283;I was just stunned by what he did.
I:1982;3284;It has great visuals, great sound, great extras, wonderful story and a great plot.
I:1982;3285;I can promise you, you won't be sorry.
I:1982;3286;This role is perfect for Mr. Downey.
I:1982;3287;It is good fun and great entertainment.
I:1982;3288;The cast in this film: Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges (who you will barely recognise), Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are amazing.
I:1982;3289;, but then the plot was so well thought out that you will want to see what are all these amazing characters up to.
I:1982;3290;He is indulgent, overconfident, rich but stilll likable.
I:1982;3291;Several comic parts are so memorable because Downey Jr. is such a gifted actor that no matter how much bad press he can get about his personal conduct in his personal life we still love him, adore his talent and those dark piercing eyes of his.
I:1982;3292;I actuallly really like this action movie where the main character does not have to be another muscle but can charm us with his sense of humor, genuine smartness and charisma.
I:1982;3293;Rated with four stars, and with good reason.
I:1982;3294;In fact, I love all the Iron Man movies and Marvel Comic movies.
I:1982;3295;Director kept it interesting all the way.
I:1982;3296;It's an amazing movie and I love every bit of it!
I:1982;3297;I've watched it so many times with my family.
I:1982;3298;The comic book come to life!
I:1982;3299;This is an awesome movie .
I:1982;3300;This is a great a movie.
I:1982;3301;1 disc is the movie, and the other is extras.
I:1982;3302;I love this movie so I enjoyed the extras as well.
I:1982;3303;This production was produced and directed very well.
I:1982;3304;It was well balanced between technology within reach, morality and the never ending struggle between good&evil, power verses compassion.
I:1982;3305;The acting was very good and I found the movie to be very entertaining as well.
I:1982;3306;This is almost a perfect super hero film.
I:1982;3307;It looks beautiful on Blu.
I:1982;3308;Mixing action with a pretty good storyline to get any non.
I:1982;3309;comics reader up to snuff on Iron Man history, this movie really does a good job.
I:1982;3310;The always entertaining Mr. Downey is on hand to present his tongue.
I:1982;3311;"cheek interpretation of the ""super."
I:1982;3312;I've always been a fan of his, and with the help of director Jon Favreau (a fine actor in his own right) the two create a silly, never boring film of complete entertainment.
I:1982;3313;Haven't heard much about Ms. Paltrow lately, but she's quite fine and confident in an important role.
I:1982;3314;As I said, everything's been blabbed away by previous reviewers, but I was amused and entertained a whole lot.
I:1982;3315;This movie was a gift for my son.
I:1982;3316;We all enjoy watching these movies
I:1982;3317;The movie is amazing, waited 2 weeks and a couple of days but was worth it.
I:1982;3318;The picture in the front cover is great, the back of the case is not as cool the 2 disc edition but its ok.
I:1982;3319;The front and the back pictures are safe.
I:1982;3320;It has really good graphics and action intensive.
I:1982;3321;great addition to add to your blu ray collection.
I:1982;3322;It is a movie that you can look at without confusing subtexts.
I:1982;3323;i recommend it if you need a fun change of pace.
I:1982;3324;I have no doubt that Robert Downey Jr will go onto that Walk Of Fame very soon.
I:1982;3325;the Iron Man movies are excellent.
I:1982;3326;sherlock Holmes is awesome,but these Ironman movies are going to be classics.
I:1982;3327;they picked the right actor for these and this first in a long line to come is amazing.
I:1982;3328;if your into action packed hero movies this is one of the best yet.
I:1982;3329;Downey puts a mixture of humour and wit into this character and he achieves making his character believable.
I:1982;3330;unlike some of the super hero movies,this one is believable.
I:1982;3331;Ironman lives up to the hype with an excellent updating of the story and quite good character development.
I:1982;3332;There is a humanity brought to the character that makes the story fantastic yet somehow believable.
I:1982;3333;Great film for whole family.
I:1982;3334;Iron Man is a great movie.
I:1982;3335;I love all the action and special effects.
I:1982;3336;Please with transactions, movie was enjoyed and added to my Ironman collection.
I:1982;3337;"rate comic book adventure ""Iron Man""."
I:1982;3338;Upon returning to the United States, a renewed Tony Stark is determined to amend his company's mistakes and improves his armor to become the high.
I:1982;3339;Iron Man is a superb crowd.
I:1982;3340;pleasing summer blockbuster that ranks as one of the best superhero movies to date.
I:1982;3341;The latest comic book adaptation delivers a well.
I:1982;3342;paced storyline, excellent visual effects, good action sequences, a solid cast and great humor.
I:1982;3343;Downey's entertaining performance as Tony Stark is one of the movie's biggest strengths.
I:1982;3344;ray with a fully loaded 2.
I:1982;3345;disc Ultimate Edition that's a must.
I:1982;3346;"Iron Man Ultimate Edition features two great documentaries: ""I Am Iron Man"" that offers an in."
I:1982;3347;"scenes look in the development of the film, and ""The Invincible Iron Man"" that explores the origins of the Marvel Comics' character."
I:1982;3348;But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made.
I:1982;3349;As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all.
I:1982;3350;time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in some ways.
I:1982;3351;It is highly entertaining all the way through.
I:1982;3352;There is something in this film for just about everyone.
I:1982;3353;The few action scenes are top notch.
I:1982;3354;Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark.
I:1982;3355;I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.
I:1982;3356;despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script.
I:1982;3357;"The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly ""summer popcorn action flick"", it is right on par."
I:1982;3358;And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans.
I:1982;3359;With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger.
I:1982;3360;As long as they never make a movie with M. o. d. o. k., I will be happy.
I:1982;3361;The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though.
I:1982;3362;I was just really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies.
I:1982;3363;It reminds me of how I felt about Star Trek.
I:1982;3364;The beautiful effects by ILM are on full display, and i saw no obvious flaws.
I:1982;3365;I'm working with a very modest Home Theatre, but I can tell the difference between a good and poor soundtrack.
I:1982;3366;As far as the Special Features fo, I loved them.
I:1982;3367;I believe one of the best things to happen to the big screen was when they started filming Marvel Comics.
I:1982;3368;Honestly, I'll go see an action.
I:1982;3369;adventure or science fiction fantasy film on the big screen over any other genre.
I:1982;3370;And the Marvel classics translate very well to film, particularly if you have a writer like Peter David doing the novelization.
I:1982;3371;He's a good actor and easy on the eyes.
I:1982;3372;Scenes from Stark's capture were gripping.
I:1982;3373;the soundtrack is particularly good with strong, evocative musical images.
I:1982;3374;"Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ""Iron Man"" and may well see the film again before it leaves the big screen."
I:1982;3375;all were at their best!
I:1982;3376;I can say however that I just saw it last night on my big screen downstairs and absolutely loved it.
I:1982;3377;During his captivity he invents a new type of energy that allows him to make some awesome new developments, in the process a villian is revealed that is initially considered his friend, this villian steals the invention from him and they fight.
I:1982;3378;Downey does an excellent job keeping us entertained and most importantly keeping my attention.
I:1982;3379;A great movie for your library if its something you are into keeping.
I:1982;3380;You can watch this film over and over again.
I:1982;3381;"There will probably never be a ""superhero"" movie that will stand the test."
I:1982;3382;but as POPULAR entertainment, some superhero movies offer more pure entertainment snap and sizzle and fun than others.
I:1982;3383;book genre with some genuinely exciting and eye.
I:1982;3384;BATMAN BEGINS created a visual feast of a world, and populated it with actors full of gravitas.
I:1982;3385;Even HELLBOY won out by bringing a tongue.
I:1982;3386;"boy""), IRON MAN is the most well."
I:1982;3387;rounded effort in this genre that I've yet seen.
I:1982;3388;I was so thoroughly enjoying myself that I wasn't ready to leave yet.
I:1982;3389;this is due in HUGE part to the splendid performance from Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;3390;Downey is convincing as Tony Stark, the brilliant, hedonistic and fabulously wealthy arms manufacturer.
I:1982;3391;He's on edge, always on the go.
I:1982;3392;We can see that his mind is moving a mile a minute.
I:1982;3393;It's nearly perfect for Stark.
I:1982;3394;"And the good thing about IRON MAN is that he's really a ""weapon"" designed and built by a brilliant man."
I:1982;3395;stark brazenly builds an escape mechanism.
I:1982;3396;because it's fun to watch the story unwind.
I:1982;3397;Downey is fully of great energy, and could carry the movie on his own.
I:1982;3398;", but I'd nearly forgotten that in the right role, she can really be a lot of ""saucy"" fun."
I:1982;3399;Bridges is shaved bald, but has a big beard.
I:1982;3400;making him a striking figure.
I:1982;3401;Shaun Taub, who was SO good in THE KITE RUNNER, is Stark's fellow prisoner, and he does another masterful job portraying a wise older gentleman with a streak of frisky humor and a big soft spot.
I:1982;3402;He's a very good character actor, and I hope to see more of him.
I:1982;3403;For once, the flying character actually looks fairly convincing.
I:1982;3404;and I wanted to enjoy more pure thrills.
I:1982;3405;I love the witty banter, the crackling dialogue and I liked the action scenes.
I:1982;3406;so while this movie is ONLY popular entertainment.
I:1982;3407;Fun, fast, witty, exciting and well.
I:1982;3408;it's a far cut above the average.
I:1982;3409;i have not found any information on why this is happening, but it's nice to know that I can watch the movie.
I:1982;3410;This is one of the BEST superhero movies to date and rates up there with The Dark Knight.
I:1982;3411;The movie is fun to watch.
I:1982;3412;The effects were top notch and the Robert plays a great Stark in my opinion.
I:1982;3413;There is enough science to satify the mind and eye candy to keep anyone's attention.
I:1982;3414;I must admit that the shape of the suit would never allow it to compete with supersonic jets, but it was still fun to imagine it.
I:1982;3415;I know that I will watch this one over and over again.
I:1982;3416;My sister recommended that I see the first one to get the idea of the story line.
I:1982;3417;It was very well made, special effects were spectacular, the idea of the story came through and I loved the asides Robert Downey Jr. made in many of the scenes.
I:1982;3418;It made the dialogue mature, sarcastic, and funny.
I:1982;3419;I have always liked Robert Downey Jr. as an actor and he is great as Iron Man!
I:1982;3420;nigh impossible to believe that someone who could have unleashed those monstrosities on the world could make not only a credible, but an exceptionally enjoyable, action thriller.
I:1982;3421;(Interesting that The Dark Knight and the upcoming Watchmen are all about making the superheroes more human and gritty, while Iron Man wants to get back to almost golden.
I:1982;3422;this is a fun movie, very well.
I:1982;3423;Quite enjoyable, and well worth your time.
I:1982;3424;This movie was good in it's own right, but I have to wonder if they creators knew what they were starting with it.
I:1982;3425;This one is a great movie to have around to allow you to revisit the start of the franchise for it's great one.
I:1982;3426;I thought it would be a waste of my time but it turned out to be entertaining and I liked all the actors.
I:1982;3427;i was very supprised at the action and acting in this movie.
I:1982;3428;Most comic book movies are just that comic book style but this movie had a good story line,comedy and great action shots.
I:1982;3429;The special effects were great.
I:1982;3430;There are two classes of superhero films: top tier ones that are psychologically real (Spiderman, X. men) or simple two.
I:1982;3431;that being said, the actors are very good, starting with Downey.
I:1982;3432;But he undergoes a pretty interesting transformation and he has nice chemistry with Paltrow, who is as luminous as ever.
I:1982;3433;When he flies through the air, it is fun and very beautiful.
I:1982;3434;His end fight is also very fun indeed, particularly as he is handicapped.
I:1982;3435;This is a great movie on so many levels.
I:1982;3436;I am not a professional reviewer, so I will just say that my wife really hates science fiction movies, but she loved this one.
I:1982;3437;Robert Downey, Jr. is terrific as Iron Man.
I:1982;3438;His character, billionaire Tony Stark, builds weapons for the U. s. military.
I:1982;3439;Downey is absolutely terrific as Stark.
I:1982;3440;It is the actor's ability to balance humor with drama that actually carries the film all the way through to its' conclusion.
I:1982;3441;The special effects are also dynamite, and the Iron Man suit creation is awesome.
I:1982;3442;The plot has good twists, and there is enough great excitement (in the first hour especially) and light humorous touches that also keep me glued to the screen.
I:1982;3443;Terrance Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, does a good job with what he has, which isn't a lot.
I:1982;3444;And the always gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts (Stark's assistant), is engaging to look at.
I:1982;3445;Her light humor and sex.
I:1982;3446;appeal adds a lot to what could've been a heavy.
I:1982;3447;handed story involving all men and action.
I:1982;3448;Every great superhero film that I know of always takes advantage of the 'love interest' (Lois Lane, Mary Jane Watson, etc.).
I:1982;3449;I hope she will have more to do in the sequel.
I:1982;3450;And Jeff Bridges, wearing a bald head and a beard, is excellent as always, and a perfect foil for Downey's Stark.
I:1982;3451;But it is Downey who really holds the film together.
I:1982;3452;, 'Iron Man' really is a great popcorn film.
I:1982;3453;man show', and he is nearly perfect.
I:1982;3454;I loved this movie .
I:1982;3455;ray, but this is the first film.
I:1982;3456;I'm delighted to say that it did.
I:1982;3457;The main feature, of course, looks extraordinary.
I:1982;3458;But IRON MAN is unique in contrast with the other Blu.
I:1982;3459;ray films and series that I have watched in the format in the amount of extras also in 1080 high.
I:1982;3460;iRON MAN also has an amazing number of special features that I actually enjoyed watching.
I:1982;3461;But I find projects like IRON MAN to be quite fascinating, since it involves combining several technologies to create the final main character, including the main actor, stunt doubles, high tech suits, robots, and extensive CGI.
I:1982;3462;Frankly, going behind the scenes of most movies .
I:1982;3463;even most very good movies .
I:1982;3464;tech super hero movies, it is very nearly as much fun as the main feature itself.
I:1982;3465;I especially enjoyed the series of short features documenting the making of the film.
I:1982;3466;I find that I enjoyed the movies itself more fully on rewatching than I did the first time through.
I:1982;3467;iRON MAN is important not merely for being a very good movie, but for being the first movie by a new studio that is certain to be among the greatest producer of box office smashes in the next decade.
I:1982;3468;After watching several Marvel characters drive some of the greatest box office hits of the past decade, Marvel has established its own production company.
I:1982;3469;It has worked wonderfully in the Spider.
I:1982;3470;He is a first rate actor who has been in many, many fine movies over the years, often in independent productions, but for a while it looked like his career might be over.
I:1982;3471;He is especially good to see in this role because his own personal problems parallel those of Tony Stark in the comics.
I:1982;3472;It has been the focus on things like this that have made several of the Marvel movies so enjoyable.
I:1982;3473;Although there is great action, ultimately they are about believable, very human individuals who become heroes.
I:1982;3474;The more human you make the characters, the more delightful they become as heroes.
I:1982;3475;It is very entertaining, above all.
I:1982;3476;I manages to keep everyone's interest throughout the whole movie.
I:1982;3477;Robert Downey Jr. makes a great Iron Man and he even looks likeTony Stark!
I:1982;3478;a Rollercoaster ride from start to finish!!
I:1982;3479;This is as perfect as a action film can get!!
I:1982;3480;Great Graphics, Storyline, Characters, Actors, Laughs, and Action all blend together to form the perfect combination.
I:1982;3481;Pretty good story arc, believable characters.
I:1982;3482;a proven comedy director with his previous efforts, Favrue has crafted a piece of true magic that holds together brilliantly.
I:1982;3483;But this film lets the audience in on a new aspect.
I:1982;3484;It can be fun and it can be more than comic relief, as in the case of Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four franchise.
I:1982;3485;aside from this, the special effects are awesome, the action is well executed and the Downey brings a joy to his performance rarely seen in a superhero film.
I:1982;3486;Thanks for giving the superhero film something new, JOY!
I:1982;3487;This was the best movie we had seen all year.
I:1982;3488;The best Marvel movie so far.
I:1982;3489;So watch it after the credits.
I:1982;3490;Also a good loaner series to friends and neighbors
I:1982;3491;They gave Tony Stark a possibly real back story with a realistic script making it a great film.
I:1982;3492;I love this movie, my favorite super hero, and the Deleted scenes feature its just awesome.
I:1982;3493;This is a pretty good adaptation of the famous Marvel comic book character.
I:1982;3494;The special effects are really good.
I:1982;3495;"gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, Tony Stark's girl Friday
I:1982;3496;She combines beauty with a charming vulnerability, and is perfect in the role.
I:1982;3497;Robert Downey Jr. was really not my idea of Tony Stark, but he carries the role off pretty well, and gives us lots of laughs.
I:1982;3498;this is the best adaptation of a comic book superhero to the screen since Spider.
I:1982;3499;Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons.
I:1982;3500;renowned bon vivant and jet.
I:1982;3501;After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man .
I:1982;3502;not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity.
I:1982;3503;Iron Man soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast.
I:1982;3504;But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi.
I:1982;3505;layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time.
I:1982;3506;He is the true heart.
I:1982;3507;These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen.
I:1982;3508;James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.
I:1982;3509;"driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in ""Iron Man"" ."
I:1982;3510;It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film.
I:1982;3511;as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness .
I:1982;3512;It's nice to see that somebody finally got it right.
I:1982;3513;Solid movie, solid Video, solid Sound, solid extras.
I:1982;3514;Something attested to by the fact that I had one conversation about this movie while attending a function at a church related retirement community.
I:1982;3515;There is just the right amount of comic relief and although some modifications have been made to the Ironman mythos, the story remains true to the spirit of Marvel Comics.
I:1982;3516;com to be at least 1000 times more entertaining than the one that I had stolen from me.
I:1982;3517;Amazon, you make everything better.
I:1982;3518;This is a comic book brought to life.
I:1982;3519;This means that you must set aside your rational understanding of physics and science and just relax and enjoy what is a marvelous adventure.
I:1982;3520;There is no doubt but that Downey is one of the best actors around today .
I:1982;3521;This screenplay in the hands of less capable actors could have been campy or dull but Bridges, Downey, and Paltrow turn it into a really excellent film.
I:1982;3522;In fact the acting is so good thoroughout that Paltrow's performance is easily overlooked but she is marvelous at showing her love for Downey while he is totally oblivious to her or to his unrecognized love for her.
I:1982;3523;I gave this film 5 stars and I thought it deserved everyone of them.
I:1982;3524;All the high tech stuff was great, especially the mobile phone.
I:1982;3525;The actors and actress blended really great.
I:1982;3526;This movie was great and rdj was great in the roll.
I:1982;3527;i had a good time watching it.
I:1982;3528;my daughter loves it too.
I:1982;3529;i certainly recomend it to any body
I:1982;3530;I believe Iron Man is the best movie of all the comic book movies put out to date.
I:1982;3531;I've seen this several times in the movies and loved it.
I:1982;3532;Otherwise, great acting, interesting story, and it's fun (which is something you cannot say about Dark Knight).
I:1982;3533;It's great to see that Robert Downey Jr. got himself straightened out.
I:1982;3534;he really makes the movie.
I:1982;3535;"Ironman is a very good movie full of action, suspense, and drama
I:1982;3536;the reason i picked this movie, because of robert downy jr. and a lot of action, the scenes were great.
I:1982;3537;I watched the movie last night and I was entertained and surprised.
I:1982;3538;as for iron mn truely a fantastic movie in every way
I:1982;3539;done: good balance of action, humor and drama and of course, Robert Downey Jr. was his usual fantastic self.
I:1982;3540;This item was a gift for a teenage grandaughter.
I:1982;3541;the second disc is also full of very interesting material.
I:1982;3542;sold at a good price and received promptly.
I:1982;3543;It was just a great action movie without 250 million dollar special effects.
I:1982;3544;Terrance Howard was great ad Jim Rhodes (War Machine).
I:1982;3545;I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.
I:1982;3546;robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time).
I:1982;3547;He makes the hero a very human character.
I:1982;3548;both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it.
I:1982;3549;The action is well shot and there is a good pacing.
I:1982;3550;It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.
I:1982;3551;the special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly.
I:1982;3552;A more believable super hero for those who aren't true believers.
I:1982;3553;A Slick menu and plenty of Extras make this a great blue ray to add to the collection, it's great use of special effects are also fun to dazzle your friends.
I:1982;3554;And Jon Favreu puts it all together, moving along with perfect pace with the right amounts of dialogue, action, comedy, cgi, costuming and plot.
I:1982;3555;Lots of action, Downey is funny throughout the film and plays a great Iron Man.
I:1982;3556;2008 has been a banner year for movies from my point of view, and one of the highest points was IRON MAN.
I:1982;3557;There have been a lot of comic.
I:1982;3558;perfect, in some ways possibly even better than Tobey Maguire's Spider.
I:1982;3559;which is saying quite a bit, as the first two Spider.
I:1982;3560;man movies basically set the bar for modern superhero movies, and set it very high.
I:1982;3561;Stark is a patriot, but also a super.
I:1982;3562;wealthy and successful genius who likes playing with his money, entertaining himself with beautiful women (and never committing to them) and basically doesn't bother to think much about the potential dark side of the weapons manufacturing that Stark Industries does best.
I:1982;3563;very much an innocent, an adult with the impulses and idealism of a child.
I:1982;3564;"He becomes a hero by the power of his own mind and resources
I:1982;3565;He's a familiar figure, a powerful and wealthy man who suddenly finds that his own mighty empire is corrupt, and he needs to fight against THAT.
I:1982;3566;And of course, THAT is the other great star of Iron Man.
I:1982;3567;well done movie, great acting, directing, script, love it love it.
I:1982;3568;Iron Man is a great movie.
I:1982;3569;It is great simply because it provides escapism fun for the length of the movie.
I:1982;3570;fi, eccentric billionaire twist, then you'll probably love Iron Man.
I:1982;3571;The video is very good.
I:1982;3572;in summary, I think it's classic movie fun.
I:1982;3573;sit back and enjoy it for what it is .
I:1982;3574;I love the Iron Man series.
I:1982;3575;The film itself is very good, enjoyed it a lot.
I:1982;3576;This is a Christmas gift for my grandson.
I:1982;3577;I have not seen the movie but he saw it during the summer and loved it, so I know he'll be thrilled to have his own to watch whenever he wants.
I:1982;3578;We are both enjoying it!
I:1982;3579;and it was worth exactly that.
I:1982;3580;hyped action film which survives solely on A. list actors and admittedly spectacular special effects.
I:1982;3581;hearted attempts to make a quick buck, still drunk with visions of grandeur roughly five years after the success of Sam Raimi's film adaptation of Spider.
I:1982;3582;Iron Man is the best movie of the entire Marvel Cinametic Universe.
I:1982;3583;Its still the best for perfectly balancing drama, action, and comedy without being to over.
I:1982;3584;top as the later Iron Man installations and The Avengers.
I:1982;3585;Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark is sympathetic and a relatable entertaining hero that has more dimensions than you would expect.
I:1982;3586;The supporting cast of characters are memorable and add to the greatness of this movie.
I:1982;3587;The story is unique and a great origin story for the character of Iron Man.
I:1982;3588;And so, I waited until the film came along, but due to circumstances beyond my control I could not get to the theatre to see it, and wow did I want to see it in the Cinema.
I:1982;3589;anyways, the film is just totally fiery from start to surprise finish.
I:1982;3590;The Computers that Stark uses are just ultra cool, and the virtual generation gear is amazing.
I:1982;3591;john Favreau has crafted another piece together with a team of people who each do their own superb thing.
I:1982;3592;It was also great to see a bit of video of Stan Winston, even though it was his studio and not him, himself who did the work.
I:1982;3593;The Cover is very cool too, since the outer cardboard image comes off to reveal the man underneath, truly a well thought out package.
I:1982;3594;Iron Man has got to be one of the most intelligent super heroes I have ever seen.
I:1982;3595;Robert Downey Jr. is an acting genius!
I:1982;3596;Great entertainment for the family movie night or to watch over and over again.
I:1982;3597;Has good flow and well photographed.
I:1982;3598;Great imagination, well crafted and believable, I find it money well spent for entertainment.
I:1982;3599;Robert Downey Jr. gives an impressive performance (along with the rest of the cast) and the effects are eye.
I:1982;3600;Robert D Jr. gives a perfect performance and the special effects will blow your mind.
I:1982;3601;I saw enough to know I liked it, and was right to get it on Blu.
I:1982;3602;Robert Downey, Jr. has gotten better with age!
I:1982;3603;Up there with Indy 4 and Prince Caspian, Iron Man was one of the top movies I was looking forward to this summer.
I:1982;3604;In fact, just about every aspect of the movie impressed me.
I:1982;3605;The wit, charm, and intensity he brought to the character incorporated everything essential about the billionaire industrialist.
I:1982;3606;He's a playboy, eccentric genius, with a drinking problem.
I:1982;3607;From the testing of Stark's armor to the final showdown, viewers will be impressed at the amazing visual effects and plenty of big explosions.
I:1982;3608;"With plenty of humor to lighten up the scenes of intense suspense and action
I:1982;3609;And after the credits roll, there's a fun little clip that fellow Marvel comic geeks will enjoy, hinting towards a sequel with some beloved characters.
I:1982;3610;the summer blockbusters have certainly started out with a bang!
I:1982;3611;I know its backwards but hey at least I got it bought finally.
I:1982;3612;I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a IM fan.
I:1982;3613;Downey as always makes a great appearance.
I:1982;3614;Iron Man is a superhero film that bucks a great many conventions.
I:1982;3615;virtuous particularly at the start, and has what appear to be almost crippling flaws.
I:1982;3616;The change he goes through is entertaining and gradual.you don't really get any superheroics until about halfway through (unless you count his spectacular escape).
I:1982;3617;Best of all, the final line of the film throws one of the most cherished traditions of superheroes out the window entirely.
I:1982;3618;as shiny as The Dark Knight was dark, Iron Man is an excellent entry into the superhero genre.
I:1982;3619;Amazon sent a replacement and it works now.
I:1982;3620;ray plus one of the best super hero movies made makes this movie a really nice pick.
I:1982;3621;so perhaps my rave review of this comic book adaptation is somewhat uninformed.
I:1982;3622;"start with a clever and detailed ""birth of Ironman"" story, a pretty funny script, and a wonderful ensemble of top."
I:1982;3623;notch actors, and you've got a great cocktail.
I:1982;3624;As has been widely commented, the movie starts and stops with Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance as genius weapon.
I:1982;3625;"Poking gentle fun at Downey's sordid past, ""Ironman"" provides a fresh perspective on the superhero ."
I:1982;3626;Stark is one cool dude.
I:1982;3627;These gifted actors breathe life into characters that not only shine in the big scenes but also in the quiet, more mundane moments in the movie.
I:1982;3628;but strongly recommend enjoying this movie for its attention to detail.
I:1982;3629;The first half of the movie shows the birth of Ironman in perhaps the most entertaining form of all .
I:1982;3630;notch special effects and how the movie .
I:1982;3631;"stays safely on the PG side without descending into ""Phantom Menace"" cartoonishness."
I:1982;3632;"an excellent film that has given birth to a new franchising juggernaut (""Ironman 2"" and ""Ironman 3"" are already in pre."
I:1982;3633;"Director Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"" may lack the epic stature of ""The Dark Knight,"" but it's more entertaining."
I:1982;3634;"Thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s inspired brilliance, this Marvel adaptation captures the fun and wonderment missing in the ""Spider."
I:1982;3635;Favreau maintains the ideal balance of humor and action without resorting to CGI overkill.
I:1982;3636;Downey receives excellent support from Gwyneth Paltrow and classic villainy from Jeff Bridges.
I:1982;3637;Iron Man is the rare comic.
I:1982;3638;book movie that transcends its source material.
I:1982;3639;Downey is great in the movie.
I:1982;3640;It very capably brought to life and modernized the Iron Man comics I read as a youth.
I:1982;3641;"Iron Man is the debut, and it's a huge success both financially and critically
I:1982;3642;"good but watchable ""The Incredible Hulk"" and the future looks bright for Marvel Studios."
I:1982;3643;tony Stark, aka Iron Man is a member of a select club of superheroes that includes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Spider.
I:1982;3644;His past history in other media includes a number of animated series (most famously the 60s cartoon of which the most memorable thing was the enjoyably cheesy theme tune), but this is the character's first film adventure.
I:1982;3645;He arrives home a changed man, vowing to take on the military.
I:1982;3646;industrial complex at home while protecting the innocent abroad.
I:1982;3647;"Downey Jr. is indispensable as Tony Stark, created one of the most likeable characters yet seen in a superhero film
I:1982;3648;"Bridges, as Stane, does a strong job as Tony's corporate foe, although he isn't an especially big part of the story
I:1982;3649;mild criticism might be that the final defeat of the Iron Monger is vague and not especially climactic, but it suits the purpose well enough.
I:1982;3650;My favorite comic book character has always been Iron Man.
I:1982;3651;"I was excited when I heard that there was going to be an ""Iron Man"" movie, and even more thrilled when I saw the first trailer."
I:1982;3652;who wouldn't dream of owning a powerful suit of red/gold armor like this?There are two big reasons why the movie is so well done.
I:1982;3653;Favreau is a comic book fan.
I:1982;3654;I've said for a long time now, that you have to know the comic book character in order to do a good movie.
I:1982;3655;Nolan is a Batman fan.
I:1982;3656;Favreau knows the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man.
I:1982;3657;And Favreau pulls out all the stops to turn in one of the best superhero movies of all time.
I:1982;3658;I put this one up there with the two Batman movies, Superman: The Movie, and Spider.
I:1982;3659;He's always been that good.
I:1982;3660;enter Obadiah Stane, wonderfully portrayed by Jeff Bridges.
I:1982;3661;The last thing he wants is to see the company go under.
I:1982;3662;gwyneth Paltrow is perfectly cast as Stark's loyal secretary, Pepper Potts.
I:1982;3663;For Pepper Potts, Tony Stark has finally found his heart.
I:1982;3664;She seems to have an attraction for him, but something holds her back, and the scenes with Paltrow and Downey Jr. are very good.
I:1982;3665;"finally, we have Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes."
I:1982;3666;The special effects are absolutely brilliant.
I:1982;3667;Seeing Iron Man soaring through the skies with his boot jets is a treat.
I:1982;3668;He looks real slick in that suit of armor, and it's especially enjoyable seeing him go into action for the first time in his red and gold suit.
I:1982;3669;the best superhero movies are those in which the focus is on the character, rather than the superhero.
I:1982;3670;Tony Stark is a character we like, and Robert Downey Jr. is the reason for bringing him to life on screen.
I:1982;3671;And through Tony Stark, Iron Man works all the more when he's finally on screen.
I:1982;3672;But something like this is easily overlooked because the movie is so well done.
I:1982;3673;"also, ""Iron Man"" is just plain fun!"
I:1982;3674;I have a strange feeling that it will be even better than this one.
I:1982;3675;"Honestly it does
I:1982;3676;"in this first and clever adaptation of ""Iron Man"" we have Tony Stark, A genius and ambitious weapons business man who finds himself after being captured by Terrorist."
I:1982;3677;In his attempt to create this weapon Stark creates a better and more efficient weapon.
I:1982;3678;"the movie is a popcorn flick above all, it does however mange to create a very well crafted origin storyline
I:1982;3679;The effects for the film are stupendous all the way.
I:1982;3680;One the later half of the movie changed from what seemed to be a serious comic book movie, into an adrenaline fueled action extravaganza.
I:1982;3681;Sure action is cool, but the way the ending was placed with him fighting the other Iron Man.
I:1982;3682;"Above all this the movie is still a triumphant adaptation
I:1982;3683;Downey Jr excels marvously as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and it's a great movie to watch with the family.
I:1982;3684;Anyways a must own by fans of the genre or new comers.
I:1982;3685;All I had to do was see Iron Man once, and I was utterly hooked on it.
I:1982;3686;mr. Downey Jr BECOMES Tony Stark, brilliant alcoholic multi.
I:1982;3687;"He is so believable that when I bring him up in conversation, I don't say ""Mr. Downey Jr was great in that scene,"" I saw ""wow, Tony did really well right there!"""
I:1982;3688;He submerged himself and became, instead of simply acted, his role.
I:1982;3689;It was beautiful to watch.
I:1982;3690;It is rare than an actor of Mr. Downey Jr's considerable talent finds a role that suits him so perfectly, that allows him to be so expressive, that makes him truly become one of the best actors of this decade, if not this generation.
I:1982;3691;i could easily wax more eloquent on the abilities of Mr. Downey Jr, but that would defeat the purpose of this review, so I will continue.
I:1982;3692;The actors and actresses in this movie are flawless and the dialogue is engaging and humorous.
I:1982;3693;What I will say is that this Blu.
I:1982;3694;ray edition does a good job of bringing the feeling of the big screen at home.
I:1982;3695;The video is very clear provided you are using high def, and the sound track is very cool for those who have multi.
I:1982;3696;All in all a very nice way to enjoy your home theater and a fun movie to watch.
I:1982;3697;I love the Avengers series, and this is probably the best of the bunch (aside from the Avengers itself).
I:1982;3698;Highly recommend if you like this kind of thing!
I:1982;3699;Not only is this the best Iron Man film, but it's one of the best in the superhero genre.
I:1982;3700;handedly establishes the tone and aesthetics of the entire Marvel film universe.
I:1982;3701;Iron Man is one of those all too rare big budget movies that actually delivers.
I:1982;3702;Downey was born to play Tony Stark but the real hero of this movie is the screenplay.
I:1982;3703;A well written story, great charactors and terrific special effects, put Iron Man on top of the Super heap!
I:1982;3704;The writers and director of IRON MAN have crafted a fine comic book adaptation, skilfully combining character, action.
I:1982;3705;Here the script is sharp and lean, and is confidently delivered by a top.
I:1982;3706;The set pieces are well constructed and the special effects are impressive.
I:1982;3707;The story, for the most part, is cohesive and convincing.
I:1982;3708;class entertainment from start to finish.
I:1982;3709;His escaping escapade led him to perfect the Iron Man suit (full of humorous scenes) and find out that back in America, there were some sneaky issues going on with his business and personal life around him.
I:1982;3710;I enjoyed the sarcastic comments and dry wit of the Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man character, and of course, Terrence Howard's character was as smooth and charismatic as Howard is in every movie.
I:1982;3711;I'm surprised to say I'd go see it again because I enjoyed the action, plus I loved the costume!
I:1982;3712;Entertaining, captivating and amazing are only the few words I can think off the top of my head to describe how great this movie is.
I:1982;3713;A must see, especially if you are a RD, J. fan!
I:1982;3714;Robert Downey Junior plays this with the right touch .
I:1982;3715;he keeps it funny with small moments of poignancy.
I:1982;3716;I recommend it for everyone no matter the type of movie you like best.
I:1982;3717;It's worth watching the whole series.
I:1982;3718;Wow, this film rocks, it's up their with Spider Man II as the best of the Marvel films.
I:1982;3719;Downey is great as Stark, he's all charisma and steel will.
I:1982;3720;Downey has fantastic chemistry with Paltrow, frankly im not her biggest fan, but I really liked he in this, mainly because she perfectly played off of Downey.
I:1982;3721;Bridges is chilling as Starks nemisis, it's weird to see him bald, but it added to his chilling look.
I:1982;3722;The CGI Ironman is incredible and his battle with Bridges at the end was spectacular.
I:1982;3723;I appreciated how the screenwriter wove issues we have today into the formula of the movie, it made it resonate all the more.
I:1982;3724;This is definitely the best Iron Man, and the best Marvel film (next to Thor) ever.
I:1982;3725;I'd recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see a movie with great acting and great action.
I:1982;3726;I would recommend this movie!
I:1982;3727;Jon Faverau's Iron Man is a fast paced action packed adaptation of the Marvel comics comic book.
I:1982;3728;A solid film that effectively balances fantasy in a realistic world, Faverau takes the superhero movie to the next level with his fresh, original vision.
I:1982;3729;He crafts a movie that stays true to the comic book roots but looks and feels so realistic I felt like I was watching real feature film about an original character not an adaptation of a 1960's superhero.
I:1982;3730;He creates the Mark II silver.
I:1982;3731;plated riveted suit that is far more powerful than the Mark I, but can't go into high altitudes.
I:1982;3732;He builds his own Iron Monger He confronts stark in his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest.
I:1982;3733;as a longtime fan of Iron Man I'm delighted with this movie.
I:1982;3734;There's just so much fanboy goodness in this movie.
I:1982;3735;"Downey's best scenes are with some CGI robots
I:1982;3736;Terrence Howard is great as Rhodey, his laid.
I:1982;3737;Samuel L. Jackson is a solid Nick Fury.
I:1982;3738;Get t this along With Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Incredible Hulk Director's cut and Superman: The Movie.
I:1982;3739;Yes, I love him and I am catching up with each one of his movies.
I:1982;3740;One of his best movies.
I:1982;3741;Special effects are amazing in Blu Ray.
I:1982;3742;My family enjoyed it, before we go to see Iron Man 2
I:1982;3743;This one is funny and has a great cast.
I:1982;3744;The story is not complicated but sophisticated enough for an adult to get involved.
I:1982;3745;The actions scenes are great and Bob Downey Jr is really a wonderful actor.
I:1982;3746;I found Iron Man to be very entertaining.
I:1982;3747;Robert Downey Jr is such a impressive actor.
I:1982;3748;He is such a relax,action pack hero.
I:1982;3749;I love the chemistry between Gweneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;3750;It was a fun movie.
I:1982;3751;Entertaining for the whole family .
I:1982;3752;A great action movie and great effects!
I:1982;3753;one of the best of the summer!
I:1982;3754;Admittedly, the Arabic was spoken nice and slowly, and was relatively keeping with what the translations said.
I:1982;3755;This superhero movie has it all.
I:1982;3756;action, humor, romance, and more.
I:1982;3757;the two disc set is interesting, but I see why they deleted the extra scenes.
I:1982;3758;Movie is a classic and a great lead in to the Avengers movie that would ultimately culminate from the separate character movies.
I:1982;3759;self centered, intelligent, handsome, sarcastic, superhero.
I:1982;3760;My son especially loves this movie!
I:1982;3761;I got what I asked for.
I:1982;3762;She and I had seen the movie together and enjoyed it immensely.
I:1982;3763;Thank you for having the movie at a reasonable price and for delivering it so fast.
I:1982;3764;Keep up the good work and by the way it is an excellent movie.
I:1982;3765;If you're a fan of these types of movies you'll love it.
I:1982;3766;Fun for everyone in the family
I:1982;3767;Most realistic adaptation of a comic book hero.
I:1982;3768;The opening part of the movie is well done and the scenes when Stark is devloping the final version of the 'Iron' suit are some of the finest use of CGI I've seen.
I:1982;3769;robert Downey Jr is excellent in the leading role (reminded me of Al Pacino in fact) and it was great to see Jeff Bridges again.
I:1982;3770;Gywneth Paltrow also gave a good performance.
I:1982;3771;Once again though there is a lovely cameo role for Stan Lee and the final few moments give us hope that Marvel may be preparing a film based on The Avengers.
I:1982;3772;I still love the comics though!
I:1982;3773;I Read your 1 star review on Incredible Hulk as well, yeah and you say Spider Man 3 was good.
I:1982;3774;Yeh, you know what is really funny?
I:1982;3775;You never acknowleged the brilliant acting, the brilliant action, and the brilliant story, just Afghanistan.
I:1982;3776;Dark Knight is in my top 5, if not the best movie I have seen.
I:1982;3777;Iron Man is one of those few movies that was amazing, it is a must .
I:1982;3778;"And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an ""iron"" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but also gives Tony Stark the ability to fly."
I:1982;3779;which is true to the comic book versions of the characters.
I:1982;3780;Man, did he nail the role of Stark!
I:1982;3781;And the rest of the cast and acting in the movie were terrific.
I:1982;3782;There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy.
I:1982;3783;the good news is that Iron Man will be back, but in what capacity is the question.
I:1982;3784;I bought it we watched the movie the next night and I even thought it was great.
I:1982;3785;For those who like action, effects, and super heros Iron Man is a great pick.
I:1982;3786;Robert Downey, Jr. absolutely rocks in this film.
I:1982;3787;Gwyneth Paltrow is refreshing as Stark's assistant.
I:1982;3788;actress in the past, she seems to relax and allow herself to enjoy the film.
I:1982;3789;Her red hair helps to downplay her natural beauty allowing her to carry herself as a slightly mousy woman in comparison to the supermodels her boss usually brings home.
I:1982;3790;Jeff Bridges, as always dominates the screen.
I:1982;3791;He is a powerful actor and a diabolical baddie.
I:1982;3792;great translation of the iron man francise to film.
I:1982;3793;great special effects and good acting.
I:1982;3794;a must see if you are a comic or action film fan.
I:1982;3795;Bought this for my son (18).
I:1982;3796;He thoroughly enjoyed the action and technology.
I:1982;3797;I found the scenery to be a bit dark.
I:1982;3798;Overall, a pretty good movie for the price.
I:1982;3799;This is a great movie and it looks beautiful in Blu Ray.
I:1982;3800;This is quite simply one of the best superhero movies ever made.
I:1982;3801;As many said, RDJ was born to play Tony Stark!
I:1982;3802;Excellent cast, special effects, humor, soundtrack and screenplay.
I:1982;3803;Love the cool Ironman suits and their weaponry.
I:1982;3804;packed escape, the Iron Man series (along with its attendant Avengers) absolutely fills the bill.
I:1982;3805;This movie is just for fun, and it delivers.
I:1982;3806;robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Mr. Tony Stark, he carries that perfect overconfident yet always believable attitude .
I:1982;3807;one of the best superhero movies yet.
I:1982;3808;overall great movie, even for someone like me who had no idea who Iron Man was before watching it.3 year old nephew got bored during the beginning part, but once the suit was created, he got into the movie and is now obsessed with Iron Man.
I:1982;3809;Must see if you're into the Avengers.
I:1982;3810;Iron Man is witty, well.
I:1982;3811;paced, superbly crafted, finely acted and packed with satisfying action sequences.
I:1982;3812;hero ever, which is a testament to just how great this movie is.
I:1982;3813;the supporting cast is solid, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;3814;His Tony Stark is simply perfect .
I:1982;3815;he's an affable, arrogant womanizer, confident to a fault.
I:1982;3816;Downey is simply fun to watch .
I:1982;3817;Roberts' sexy long eye lashes, his smile and his amazing acting abilities never stops amazing me.
I:1982;3818;Bought this for my husband and he adores it!
I:1982;3819;Arrived swiftly and in perfect condition.
I:1982;3820;I am very glad I got this edition, the special features are great fun!
I:1982;3821;Excellent Movie and great action.
I:1982;3822;Robert Downey, Jr. is one of the best actor's in Hollywood.
I:1982;3823;He makes this look effortless.
I:1982;3824;great to see robert downey, jr. back in the game.
I:1982;3825;he is a great actor.
I:1982;3826;great action,great comedy,i was pleasantly surprised with how they pulled iron man off.
I:1982;3827;man, I got to thinking, 'Who actually has heard of Iron.
I:1982;3828;This movie is so amazing that it kick started the entire marvel franchise and lead to some of the greatest movies ever and still more to come
I:1982;3829;Fun movie to watch with family on movie night.
I:1982;3830;Love this movie and loved the deal I got .
I:1982;3831;Great movie and fast shipping~!
I:1982;3832;But I bought it for someone as a gift and we watched it together.
I:1982;3833;I am now a fan of this movie and cant wait for another one.
I:1982;3834;Tony Stark (Downey Jr) is a man made rich off his father's munitions business of Stark Industries and lives rather recklessly as a result, cavorting about the world in private jets and expensive cars, bedding beautiful women and drinking at all hours of the day.
I:1982;3835;Beneath a seemingly spoiled rich boy exterior lies an astounding brain for engineering, Stark's company reaching new and glorious heights with his brilliant fabrications of innovative and powerful weapons for the US military.
I:1982;3836;"Knowing he's a dead man no matter whether he accepts or refuses the terms, Tony sets to work on his greatest design yet, something that brings meaning to the saying ""necessity is the mother of invention""."
I:1982;3837;"being a comic book adaptation, you can expect some impressive visual effects from ""Iron Man"" and you get them in spades."
I:1982;3838;director Jon Favreau (an actor turned director) does an admirable job in the driver's seat with this big.
I:1982;3839;"It will be interesting to see whether he can be on par with or surpass Sam Raimi's ""Spider."
I:1982;3840;"bottom line: Be you an action movie fan or a lover of superhero fables, ""Iron Man"" will entertain you in more ways than one with its non."
I:1982;3841;stop action, engaging story and charismatic performance from Robert Downey Jr.
I:1982;3842;its was really good i like the 2 and 3 as well.
I:1982;3843;but the first is really great.
I:1982;3844;Classic film and well made adapation of the classic comic book.
I:1982;3845;This is one of the better comic book movies.
I:1982;3846;"It was so refreshing to watch someone with great intelligence problem solve during ""impossible situations""."
I:1982;3847;i would also mention that Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding.
I:1982;3848;I've always considered him to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and he did not disappoint.
I:1982;3849;Of course Gweneth Paltrow did an excellent job as well.
I:1982;3850;in conclusion, I would highly recommend this movie, particularly to those who enjoy intelligent characters, action, sci.
I:1982;3851;Having watched this movie on a plane ride, my first impression was that I really liked the movie.
I:1982;3852;If you aren't a fan of comic book style suspension of disbelief, please move on.
I:1982;3853;Instead he builds a prototype Iron Man suit and escapes.
I:1982;3854;the video is presented via the AVC codec and looks amazing.
I:1982;3855;This release has 2 discs in it, one for the main feature and a few extras (deleted scenes) and one for quite a few interesting and in depth documentaries.
I:1982;3856;also included is a BD Live connection.
I:1982;3857;I have not yet created an account and logged in to see what's available, but even if all you have access to is what's on the disc, the extras are amazing.
I:1982;3858;Just turn off auto install/connect and you should be good to go.
I:1982;3859;Let me start off by saying that Iron Man is a great movie.
I:1982;3860;It's easily one of the best Marvel Comics based movies I've seen, right up there with the X. men movies and the Spiderman movies.
I:1982;3861;The special effects are great and make it one of the most Blu.
I:1982;3862;ray worthy movies I've seen in a while.
I:1982;3863;The action is top notch and Robert Downey Jr. nails the role of Tony Stark dead on.
I:1982;3864;That's well worth a helpful vote.
I:1982;3865;however, like I said, this is a great movie.
I:1982;3866;I'm sure once the server traffic lightens up, things will work fine.
I:1982;3867;"I think people have never gotten a sense of ""payback"" after 911 and this could have been the perfect film to do just that."
I:1982;3868;Excellant action movie with a comic book type heros.
I:1982;3869;Nice to see Robert Downey Jr doing well.
I:1982;3870;And it proved to be worthwhile.
I:1982;3871;This is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a Marvel comic book character to date.
I:1982;3872;The storytelling, visual effects and action sequence all deliver.
I:1982;3873;Robert Downey, Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark, the playboy/weapons seller turned superhero.
I:1982;3874;His performance is truly believable and clever, and gives this superhero movie its heart.
I:1982;3875;After what seemed like an eternity, a Marvel superhero film truly delivers!
I:1982;3876;This is one of the best comic to film adaptations produced based upon a literate script, terrific performances, solid direction, and special effects that aren't over.
I:1982;3877;robert Downey, Jr. is NOT the kind of person anyone would expect to play a superhero and that is precisely why this film works so well in casting him as one as his character is the total opposite of a superhero at first.
I:1982;3878;Stark is assisted by a number of people from his glorified secretary well.
I:1982;3879;played by Gwenyth Paltrow to his military connection nicely acted by Terrence Howard.
I:1982;3880;Jeff Bridges hams it up some in this role, but he's convincing and fun as the eventual villain.
I:1982;3881;While I believe that Paltrow is better than this kind of film, she gives a very spirited performance.
I:1982;3882;topTransformers.4) The direction is confident and unobtrusive which I can't say for a film such asSpider.
I:1982;3883;This film has some heart and soul.6) I can't say enough about the literate script for this film.
I:1982;3884;It can be funny one moment and cerebral the next.
I:1982;3885;That is tough to do in this comic book adaptation genre.
I:1982;3886;This film finds a comfortable balance between serious and humorous.
I:1982;3887;I've been enjoying revisiting the film, and never mind its flaws.
I:1982;3888;It's still as much fun as when it first came out.
I:1982;3889;I enjoyed the movie quite a lot, and now have seen them all.
I:1982;3890;highly recommended by our movie viewing crew.
I:1982;3891;Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as Ironman.
I:1982;3892;The special effects are awesome too.
I:1982;3893;This is a great entertainer done very well.
I:1982;3894;But how does Ironman compete so well with the Spidey and Superman films that have already established a following?Ans:1.
I:1982;3895;With a great script, catchy dialouges and funny one.
I:1982;3896;Great chemistry between co. stars.
I:1982;3897;The pair is so good they give the Clark Kents.
I:1982;3898;That was a nice one too.
I:1982;3899;Jeff Bridges does a good job.
I:1982;3900;Robert Downey Junior makes a great comeback and Gwenyth does a pleasant job as the secretary.
I:1982;3901;"sans Ozzie's vocals, it was great to hear the riffs from Black Sabbath's ""IronMan"" at the end of the movie."
I:1982;3902;Iron Man is one of the best action movies I have seen in quite some time.
I:1982;3903;The writing, acting and production work all came together and produced a wonderfully entertaining escape for fiction lovers like myself.
I:1982;3904;I would even recommend this movie to those who do not usually watch science fiction or fantasy action films.
I:1982;3905;There is a lot comedy in this movie (which you should expect with Robert Downey Jr.)!
I:1982;3906;I could already tell this movie would be a lot of fun from the trailer, but I was surprised just how good it really was.
I:1982;3907;Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect casting choice, a la Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.
I:1982;3908;Jon Favreau, the brilliant writer of Swingers, clearly has as much fun with the character as Sam Raimi has with Spiderman, and Tony Stark is very well fleshed.
I:1982;3909;Great background story of how Stark became Iron Man, and also a fantastic technology sequence where Stark is perfecting his machine.
I:1982;3910;The battle at the end is not bad, although not as cool as the fight scenes in Matrix 2, and the movie has the best ending/closing line of any movie in recent memory.
I:1982;3911;"I also loved the use of the song ""Iron Man"" by Black Sabbath in the closing credits of the film, spot on."
I:1982;3912;an absolutely brilliant actor .
I:1982;3913;A lot of action of course and the special effects were good but the script, not so much.
I:1982;3914;This is an action packed movie and my son loves it too.
I:1982;3915;Robert Downey, Jr is funny and a great fit for this movie.
I:1982;3916;I was eager to see Iron Man but it was really good.
I:1982;3917;I received it exactly as I expected and it was in pristine shape.
I:1982;3918;This is the best of the three movies as I LOL everytime I watch this movie when he is testing the gravity boots!!!
I:1982;3919;My whole family loved this movie.
I:1982;3920;It shipped fast to my home and was brand new as described.
I:1982;3921;This is one of my very favorite movies.
I:1982;3922;I like Robert Downy Jr. and the story of good versus evil.
I:1982;3923;We've all seen the movie by now and know how good it is, so I don't need to review the movie itself.
I:1982;3924;My family an I truly enjoyed this movie and the price was great.
I:1982;3925;I thank you for a wonderful movie.
I:1982;3926;Iron Man is an excellent movie for anyone, regardless of age.
I:1982;3927;Children can enjoy it because it's understandable to the younger views (and not too violent).
I:1982;3928;Adults can enjoy it be it's fun, witty and entertaining.
I:1982;3929;The story was well written and leaves plenty of room for sequels.
I:1982;3930;ray version is very sharp, crisp and has some pretty nice special features.
I:1982;3931;I really enjoy Iron Man movies.
I:1982;3932;I love this film and i like Robery Downey Jr.
I:1982;3933;His character, Stark, was tough, and funny, and it's good to see that after all his earlier problems he's doing so well in the movies.
I:1982;3934;The humor in this show really was great, especially between him and his robot, Dummy, gets even better when he's trading remarks with people.
I:1982;3935;This movie has decent acting, by far the best Robert Downy Jr. movie I have ever seen and he made me want to watch more.
I:1982;3936;As long as you are looking for a high action entertaining choice, Iron Man is the way to go!
I:1982;3937;Downey steals the show without taking away the main character of Tony Stark and the Tin Man as being the center of the story.
I:1982;3938;"some actors are so good, you forget who theyre playing and just pay attention to ""them"" and not their ""character"".)"
I:1982;3939;Marvel got it right this time .
I:1982;3940;There is a great plot, and sub.
I:1982;3941;plot, and the acting is very good.
I:1982;3942;Jeff Brydges plays an excellent .
I:1982;3943;Even if you're an adult like I am, give it a try!
I:1982;3944;Robert Downey Jr. plays a great Tony Stark.
I:1982;3945;The cinematography is also done very well.
I:1982;3946;One of the best comic to movie screens I have seen.
I:1982;3947;Downey is perfect in portraying Tony Stark.
I:1982;3948;Action was top notch and the special effects were perfect.
I:1982;3949;Marvel has redeemed itself with this fantastic flick (Fantastic 4 was alright)Great action, graphics, sound, story, and laughs!
I:1982;3950;ray disc I ordered came quickly, I know I always get great service with Amazon.
I:1982;3951;Nice to know I can get great products and a good price and get them quickly.
I:1982;3952;Great action if that's what you're looking for!
I:1982;3953;But has a little romance and comedy thrown in for good measure.
I:1982;3954;"I understand from the ""bonus features"" that it rated pretty high with the women actually!"
I:1982;3955;ray is an awesome movie experience!
I:1982;3956;With incredible performances from the cast, great visual effects, and spectacular direction by Jon Favreau, Iron Man will thrill audiences of all ages.
I:1982;3957;Highly recommended for anyone who cannot get enough of action movies!
I:1982;3958;Tony Stark is a fun character, and this movie tells his story from the start.
I:1982;3959;After watching and enjoying the avengers movie, my kids, fiance, and I decided to start watching each superheros individual movies.
I:1982;3960;Great film adaption of a classic comic series.
I:1982;3961;I highly recommend it, Robert Downey Jr plays the rich corporate head, womanizer billionaire perfectly.
I:1982;3962;He did a great job otherwise, and I wasn't one of those whining about him being chosen for the role.
I:1982;3963;"But when I heard the name ""Obadiah Stane"" (now I know how to pronounce it after 20 years), I thought ""Uh."
I:1982;3964;Which brings me to what really got me into this movie.
I:1982;3965;James Rhodes eyes up a spare suit of armor.
I:1982;3966;the creative balance that was achieved also struck me.
I:1982;3967;It's as if the makers were very mindful in creating a film with comics fans, casual moviegoers, and thinking viewers in mind.
I:1982;3968;Redemption, in my mind, was one of this film's messages.
I:1982;3969;That plot point alone makes Iron Man a more timely superhero movie than any other I can think of.
I:1982;3970;"Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts really captures the Girl Friday aspect of Potts' character as well as that of someone who's ""just a friend"" to a superstar guy."
I:1982;3971;"Howard and Downey really had the ""buddy mojo"" working."
I:1982;3972;The armor looked so real you felt as if you could touch it.
I:1982;3973;Repulsor rays are just more elegant, and they weren't neglected.
I:1982;3974;so what we have here is an excellent heroic fantasy tale with a touch of James Bond, a swig of Golden Age cinematic romance, and a pro.
I:1982;3975;peace message that takes more than a jab at the military/industrial complex.
I:1982;3976;It's a film that I can effortlessly refer to anyone, lovers of comics and cinema alike.
I:1982;3977;respect the source material and the field in which the tales are originally told, and you will reap dividends, creatively and commercially.
I:1982;3978;Now that all of our summer blockbusters have become nothing but comic book super heroes, some of them still deliver a great time.
I:1982;3979;In fact, I can't remember any of the villains from his comics, but he had a cool suit and the artwork was as topnotch as the best of Marvel during the 70s.
I:1982;3980;the film version definitely has as much to offer as the best of the super hero movie.
I:1982;3981;The script is tight, the characters are fleshed out, the humor is funny and genuine, the special effects and production values are topnotch.
I:1982;3982;Robert Downey Jr. brings a lot to the role of Tony Stark and you almost believe the role was written just for him.
I:1982;3983;iRON MAN leaves you wanting more.
I:1982;3984;The first and best one in the series, sadly the series didn't do much better until the third one.
I:1982;3985;Great movie and I didn't think I would be a fan of the Iron Man at all.
I:1982;3986;actors/actresses are well cast for the most part.
I:1982;3987;The acting is good all around.
I:1982;3988;Well the list goes on, but I think that this was one of the most faithful creations of a DC/Marvel comic movie conversion.
I:1982;3989;i think that Robert Downey Jr. was a good choice I just hope that he can stay out of trouble long enough to make the sequel they left the movie open for.
I:1982;3990;Im a huge comic book fan (just started reading them again recently) and especially love movies based on them.
I:1982;3991;But I knew I had to see this movie.
I:1982;3992;But he prooved everyone why he was perfect for the role.
I:1982;3993;this is on my list of the 5 best superhero movies of all time which includes Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Incredible Hulk and Blade.
I:1982;3994;This you should do as so as possible.
I:1982;3995;Here they actually show a movie, with actors, scripts, special effects, my goodness do they have great and even believable special effects (remember it is a movie so suspend your reality for an 1 1/2 or so and enjoy the movie).
I:1982;3996;Robert Downey, Jr. is a man that I respect both on and off the screen looking at all that he has overcome to come back from that dark place to establish himself as one of the very best actors in the business now with 2 nice movie series on the roll in this and his great portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.
I:1982;3997;Like I said it is a fun movie so just kick back, let some stress leave you alone and enjoy one fine movie for awhile.
I:1982;3998;,Robert Downey Jr. in the best and most iconic role of his career.
I:1982;3999;the most epic superhero in all Marvel history.
I:1982;4000;It is a great super hero movie.
I:1982;4001;It truly brings Iron Man to life and it makes it seem that it could happen.
I:1982;4002;The movie is packed with action and special effects so Blu.
I:1982;4003;"This is good for Marvel Films because they will need to use some of the profits from this film to offset the inevitable loss for their next film, ""The Incredible Hulk"" starring Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, due later this summer."
I:1982;4004;Watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean.
I:1982;4005;When Tony comes of age, he takes over the company from his father's right hand man, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the two work together, as a team .
I:1982;4006;But he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side.
I:1982;4007;When he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities.
I:1982;4008;Now that Tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world.
I:1982;4009;But Colonel Rhodes (Terence Howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend.
I:1982;4010;"directed by Jon Favreau (""Elf"", ""Zathura"" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season."
I:1982;4011;Now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats.
I:1982;4012;Iron Man is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect.
I:1982;4013;Robert Downey, Jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of Tony Stark.
I:1982;4014;A rich, highly intelligent industrialist, Tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful.
I:1982;4015;Tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them.
I:1982;4016;This system allows him to view 3.
I:1982;4017;as we get to know Tony, we realize he lives a secluded life.
I:1982;4018;Allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to Obadiah.
I:1982;4019;When he travels to Afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world.
I:1982;4020;when Stark is taken prisoner in Afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive.
I:1982;4021;And he also creates a prototype of Iron Man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them.
I:1982;4022;This is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.
I:1982;4023;This same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable.
I:1982;4024;He proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.
I:1982;4025;favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for Stark to live in.
I:1982;4026;These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.
I:1982;4027;There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
I:1982;4028;Hopefully, this area will be expanded and improved upon in the next installment.
I:1982;4029;Tony continues to work with Obadiah, leaving the day to day operations in his hands, freeing him up to work on his creations.
I:1982;4030;Obadiah is a very smart man and makes the company very profitable.
I:1982;4031;He also steals Tony's plans and begins work on his own version of Iron Man, seeing the potential in such a lethal weapon.
I:1982;4032;Obadiah has spent his adult life selling weapons, becoming rich as a result.
I:1982;4033;So in his mind, lethal is good.
I:1982;4034;obadiah is a lot more twisted and crooked than I am letting on, but discovering the extent of this is half the fun.
I:1982;4035;as you watch the story unfold, you get the sense Howard, like everyone else in the film, is having a fun time.
I:1982;4036;He plays the role with a certain sense of tongue.
I:1982;4037;Iron Man is a very good, very enjoyable, fun summer film.
I:1982;4038;The actors have a lot of fun and it translates to the screen.
I:1982;4039;The performances, in combination with a well.
I:1982;4040;"written screenplay, great special effects and a believable universe help to make ""Iron Man"" one of the more memorable summer films in many years."
I:1982;4041;"I can easily see this character becoming a franchise to challenge ""Spiderman"" in popularity."
I:1982;4042;The bigger the screen you have the better the action.
I:1982;4043;This movie blew everyone away.
I:1982;4044;Most people thought it would be like every other comic movie, but this one actually has a good plot and good actors.
I:1982;4045;"Iron Man was the best of Marvel's staple of movies up through and including ""The Avengers""."
I:1982;4046;The casting of Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark was brilliant.
I:1982;4047;Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts hits her poise, confidence, and vulenrability points to perfection.
I:1982;4048;this is a movie that you can watch and enjoy again and again, and notice new little things that you hadn't before.
I:1982;4049;the development of the characters is quite accomplished for such a popcorn flick and it is punctuated throughout with a nice variety of moments of action, humor, and exploration.
I:1982;4050;This is one of the things that the film actually does best: it lets the audience explore what it is like to discover becoming Iron Man.
I:1982;4051;"And those moments of him taking out the terrorists are just great
I:1982;4052;is this the best superhero movie ever?
I:1982;4053;This one had heart and the acting was superior in my option to the sequels.
I:1982;4054;And honestly, I am a fan of Don's acting but I still prefer Terrance Howard as Rhodey.
I:1982;4055;I'm a huge fan of superhero movies and Marvel.
I:1982;4056;I enjoyed Iron Man and feel every fan needs to watch this movie!
I:1982;4057;heroes have made our nights in the theater all the more exciting and thought provoking.
I:1982;4058;"Now, with Marvel Comics' taking the studio reigns on ""Iron Man,"" they've done something totally new."
I:1982;4059;Iron Man is the rare comic book movie that stands apart from its origins, a movie that could have been made without a back.
I:1982;4060;mythology, and a film you can go see without previously knowing anything about the source material.
I:1982;4061;a great deal of this has to do with the casting.
I:1982;4062;He's all oily charm and malevolence, and watching is descent into the Iron Monger is a marvel (pun intended).
I:1982;4063;When Tony Stark perfects the second Iron Man outfit (with the help of his AI companions), it really will make you believe he can fly.
I:1982;4064;Even with the CGI, the suits look realistic and hot.
I:1982;4065;The gadgets are worthy of a Bond Film, and the humor that slides in helps give the movie balance.
I:1982;4066;All in all, a great Good Vs Evil night at the movies, down to the Black Sabbath finally popping up in the credits.
I:1982;4067;For the action and adventure lovers who love Marvel's superheroes , you will love this movie.
I:1982;4068;If you like high tech toys, you will enjoy it as we'll.
I:1982;4069;A big fan of comics, I really, really wanted to like Iron Man, but it left me cold.
I:1982;4070;Hollywood spends a kabillion dollars on this movie, and this is the best script they can come up with?
I:1982;4071;and I absolutely love the way he plays the character ofTony Stark.
I:1982;4072;Highly recommend all three of the Iron Man movies.
I:1982;4073;It was a good story line though.
I:1982;4074;I'm sure there's a great explanation for why I never got it but hey, you make the call.
I:1982;4075;I wouldn't care how the acting was, I love the marvel comic characters and loved this movie.
I:1982;4076;I thought the acting was great.
I:1982;4077;The action was awesome and I also bought Iron Man 2 and all the others including the Avengers.
I:1982;4078;Even the extras are in Blu ray and they are very interesting.
I:1982;4079;Entertaining, action packed, great effects, awsome soundtrack, solid performances.
I:1982;4080;This is now in my top 5 favorite movies of all time.
I:1982;4081;As Tony Stark (and Iron Man), Downey is quirky, consistent, and funny throughout.
I:1982;4082;great presentation of the Iron Man.
I:1982;4083;A nice comeback by Jeff Bridges.
I:1982;4084;"And the ending leaves the door wide open for ""Iron Man 2""."
I:1982;4085;It's a good movie to get for your home entertainment.
I:1982;4086;Very good, I was impressed by the diversity of multiple auctions in this movie of a man captured by an enemy, I like it.
I:1982;4087;"tier comic heroes, Jon Favreu's ""Iron Man"" rules over the second."
I:1982;4088;"Though not on par with the finest Marvel adaptations, Sam Raimi's ""Spider."
I:1982;4089;Stark is a true American hero: he wasn't born with any superpowers, and though he was born into a substantially.
I:1982;4090;The similarities between Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne further connect the two films, but Favreau's vivid, colorful style ensures that the similarities end there.
I:1982;4091;clad activities mimic the character's lavish lifestyle, while the action sequences may be the sturdiest in any Marvel film.
I:1982;4092;In fact, this is the best thing Downey has ever done.
I:1982;4093;though Downey could easily hold the film on his own, he's supported by a delightful cast.
I:1982;4094;Most delightful is Gwyneth Paltrow, who is as adorable and charming in the role of Stark's gentle secretary Pepper Potts as anyone.
I:1982;4095;One wishes a character so irresistible and clever as Potts would play a bigger role in the film, but no doubt that'll happen in the sequel.
I:1982;4096;Similarly likeable is Terrence Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, military pilot Jim Rhodes .
I:1982;4097;the most surprising performance comes from Jeff Bridges.
I:1982;4098;But that's just what he is in this film, and what a villain he is!
I:1982;4099;It's a welcome change from the over.
I:1982;4100;"They may even surpass the stunning effects from last summer's ""Transformers."
I:1982;4101;This script is a fine one indeed, the product of two writing duos (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway).
I:1982;4102;It also, miraculously, is able to appeal equally to those familiar and those unfamiliar with the comics.
I:1982;4103;Part of this is the sensible decision to upgrade Tony Stark from a Vietnam.
I:1982;4104;But while it appeals to fans and non.
I:1982;4105;fans, it's those familiar with the comic that will enjoy the film the most: it hints at a number of potential storylines for sequels, and even sets up an Avengers movie.
I:1982;4106;Iron Man is one of the increasingly rare films which longs for a sequel and which we wish would receive one.
I:1982;4107;"man 2,"" ""Batman Begins,"" or even the original ""Superman,"" but it's a darn good superhero film."
I:1982;4108;I was surprised that the story it self is interesting.
I:1982;4109;the premise is, of course, a comic book hero brought to the big screen.
I:1982;4110;Knowing this helps enjoy the movie as some things are pretty far fetched.
I:1982;4111;Great movie, Good story, and Robert Downy Jr.
I:1982;4112;Entertaining, visually exciting and well.
I:1982;4113;Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic, bringing wit and charm to the role.
I:1982;4114;this is the best .
I:1982;4115;Awesome scenes great story line would recommend to anyone that loves action movies must see before u watch any of the other iron man movies
I:1982;4116;This is an incredible movie.
I:1982;4117;Robert Downey played the role extremely well.
I:1982;4118;"The whole guilt and redemption angle on the character of Tony Stark struck a very deep resonance with me, as I'm a big fan of ""comeback"" stories where the protagonist falls so far off his high horse, only to realize his mistakes, then use those events as a learning tool and lead himself to do greater good."
I:1982;4119;I really enjoyed the movie's plot and characters from beginning to end.
I:1982;4120;And if history has dictated anything, it's that the 2nd act of a trilogy has always greatly outdone its predecessor.
I:1982;4121;5.0Colors are very vibrant from skin tones to backgrounds to all the shiny versions of the Iron Man suits.
I:1982;4122;Paramount has done a spectacular job on the transfer, making this instant demo material for friends, family, or business alike.
I:1982;4123;In particular, the cave break and liberation of Gulmira (including the jet chase) scenes are worth watching over and over again just for the flashy lights and sleek cinematography.
I:1982;4124;Black levels handle extremely well during cave, night, and other dimly.
I:1982;4125;lit scenes keeping most, if not all, kinds of object detail looking crisp and sharp.
I:1982;4126;Contrast is equally suiting and really helps the overall photography adding a complimentary sense of depth and dimensionality between people, objects, and backgrounds.
I:1982;4127;ray setup with this movie.
I:1982;4128;enough to help create just the right amount of immersion for each scene, and dialogue is clear through the center channel.
I:1982;4129;II's test flight for good measure.
I:1982;4130;So make sure your theater system has all the right settings, then crank that baby up to wow your guests.
I:1982;4131;5.0Thanks in big part to the hours of extras on both the feature and additional 25GB disc, I actually learned quite a bit of informative things about the Iron Man franchise as a whole and the respectable hard work that went into producing this summer blockbuster.
I:1982;4132;If you like the movie, you'll really like these extras.
I:1982;4133;5.0For a setup of an eventual trilogy, I rank this as the top tier with Batman Begins as the other best of its kind.
I:1982;4134;The characters and script are highly entertaining, and the story has just the right amount of depth to bring about my empathy.
I:1982;4135;A must own for comic book fans.
I:1982;4136;The entry to the Iron Man Franchise is very well made.
I:1982;4137;Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect fit for Tony Stark.
I:1982;4138;This movie is very well planned and all actors did an excellent job portraying the characters and bringing them to life.
I:1982;4139;It will always be one of my all time favorite movies ever made.
I:1982;4140;I thought with all the superhero stuff it was going to be dumb, but actually a great movie.
I:1982;4141;Robert Downey Jr. is great as usual playing Tony Stark.
I:1982;4142;I especially liked Downey's particular style of acting .
I:1982;4143;Jeff Bridges turned in an excellent performance also.
I:1982;4144;Audio and video are the best I've seen.
I:1982;4145;There are some very funny lines and actions throughout.
I:1982;4146;she was beautifully stunning in this movie.
I:1982;4147;This was a gift for my husband, he really enjoys this movie and watches then over and over again, really liked this one myself
I:1982;4148;I didn't want to see it at first because I thought it wouldn't do the original Iron Man justice, but it was pretty good.
I:1982;4149;He is amazing, nice to look at and funny.
I:1982;4150;it actually focused on the hero.
I:1982;4151;You got this one right!
I:1982;4152;This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
I:1982;4153;But this is one film that actually manages to live up to everything one might expect from all that that word entails.
I:1982;4154;This is quite possibly the greatest superhero film ever.
I:1982;4155;The CG effects are wholly indistinguishable from the practical ones, the action comes in somewhat small but memorable doses, and most importantly the story takes it's time developing it's characters and their unique relationships.
I:1982;4156;"And that is where ""Iron Man"" hits it's home run: characters you thoroughly enjoy watching that make the action sequences and special effects just icing on the cake."
I:1982;4157;The opening sequence does a great job of summing up the audaciousness, charm, and humor of weapons dealer/genius inventor/billionaire Tony Stark just before his caravan is attacked.
I:1982;4158;An explosive with his company's name on it that sends shrapnel into his chest, setting the story in motion.
I:1982;4159;Flashback to some days back and we get a better picture of our hero to be.
I:1982;4160;And let me tell you, it is good to be Tony Stark.
I:1982;4161;Robert Downey Jr. is everything you'd hope, bringing the kind of bombastic personality that just can't be portrayed in a comic book to the big screen.
I:1982;4162;The supporting cast is also strong.
I:1982;4163;Also worthy of note is Jeff Bridges' convincing performance as Stark's business partner Obediah.
I:1982;4164;based humor, and moral arguments and choices.
I:1982;4165;Now THERE'S a superhero I can relate to.
I:1982;4166;This is a film firing on all cylinders and is sure to please all but the most jaded of fans.
I:1982;4167;It's about time that the Golden Avenger got his big.
I:1982;4168;screen due, but it was worth the wait to see it dome so superbly.
I:1982;4169;Probably still my favorite superhero movie, and this version of it is terrific.
I:1982;4170;I thought it looked great on Blu ray.
I:1982;4171;This movie really is just so much fun.
I:1982;4172;You really should watch this one first then move through the marvel cinematic timeline to really appreciate the Avengers.
I:1982;4173;Downey has a great, manic energy about him, and it shines through in this movie.
I:1982;4174;Iron Man one of the hippest, best.
I:1982;4175;His favorite of Marvel comics.
I:1982;4176;Good for all ages and genders for action and adventure and good clean fun.
I:1982;4177;My wife and I loved it.
I:1982;4178;probably me a little more than my wife, but still, lots of fun.
I:1982;4179;The Summer season is here and this year it gets an iron boost from finally a new marvel comic franchise hopeful.
I:1982;4180;Having no expectations for Iron Man I was more than surprised with how much I enjoyed it.
I:1982;4181;They force him to build them one of his famous bombs, but instead he builds a great big metal suit!
I:1982;4182;A suit which he uses to escape back to America successfully, and once home starts building a better one.
I:1982;4183;This does not go over well with a few people and brings us to a climatic fight between a villain (I will let you be surprised who it is) and Iron Man.
I:1982;4184;talking, careless billionaire who gets a reality check brilliantly, and Gwyneth Paltrow is immensely entertaining as Pepper Potts, his cool, calculated assistant.
I:1982;4185;Together they have the perfect amount of chemistry that only increases your desire to see Iron Man II.
I:1982;4186;iron Man is a strong beginning to what will hopefully, yes I am actually hoping for more, be a successful franchise.
I:1982;4187;still Iron Man is a strong, very strong film to open the Summer Season, and does not disappoint.
I:1982;4188;The mark of a good film is when, even with a running time of 126 minutes, it leaves you wanting more!
I:1982;4189;When viewing it I thought I was in the theatre.
I:1982;4190;Received the video within a few days in perfect condition.
I:1982;4191;I enjoy the Iron Man movies.
I:1982;4192;This one has plenty of action with some romance mixed in.
I:1982;4193;It is a great movie I have watched several times.
I:1982;4194;I finally watched it on Amazon Prime, and I really enjoyed it.
I:1982;4195;time fan of Robert Downey Jr., and I thought he was great in this film.
I:1982;4196;Ironman is a fantastic movie.
I:1982;4197;The action starts at the beginning of the movie and continues throughout the entire movie.
I:1982;4198;The special effects are awesome!
I:1982;4199;Robert Downey, Jr. is a perfect match for this character.
I:1982;4200;This is a very good film.
I:1982;4201;This movie is excellent because of the relationships between characters as that adds to the story.
I:1982;4202;Except it's nowhere as good as that film.
I:1982;4203;It's strictly a good guy.
I:1982;4204;Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!)
I:1982;4205;"A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit
I:1982;4206;Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan.
I:1982;4207;Stark is also a brilliant scientist and engineer who designs many of his own weapons and devices.
I:1982;4208;While unveiling a new missile to American troops in Afghanistan, Stark is knocked unconscious, receives a heart injury, and is captured by terrorists.
I:1982;4209;The group calls themselves the Ten Rings.
I:1982;4210;Stark gets to work, but instead of building the weapon the terrorists requested, he builds a suit of power armor that he uses to escape from the terrorist camp.
I:1982;4211;Seeing what his weapons can do when placed in the wrong hands is too much and he decides that the company will take a new direction.
I:1982;4212;iRON MAN is an excellent comic book movie.
I:1982;4213;The acting is solid, the script well.
I:1982;4214;written, and the direction superb.
I:1982;4215;Though hinting at a darker future (as well as plot developments for future sequels), the film is full of hope, optimism, and good old American patriotism.
I:1982;4216;Robert downey jr is a great tony stark.
I:1982;4217;Lots of explosions and action.
I:1982;4218;This movie has just the right mix of action/Adventure and comic relief to make it fun for everyone.
I:1982;4219;My husband and I loved it!
I:1982;4220;I really enjoyed this movie, and found the humor to be really good!
I:1982;4221;This movie is perfect if you are getting into the Marvel movies or if you are interested in watching a good super hero movie!
I:1982;4222;hero genre, with great creativity and humor.
I:1982;4223;This new string of Marvel financed movies are turning out to be great adaptations.
I:1982;4224;You're gonna love Downey Jr. as Iron Man, and your going to love the action and adventure.
I:1982;4225;iron Man has a lot of great things that will carry it through a big franchise.
I:1982;4226;Its humor draws a big audience.
I:1982;4227;It's technological action, with a strong reality wired in, appeases many skeptics and comic bookies alike.
I:1982;4228;Its adaptation from comic to film is very similar to Batman's recent treatment, with a focused concentration on making the character believable.
I:1982;4229;In any comic book adaptation, I believe you really have to convince the audience that this person would do this.
I:1982;4230;besides the great film, the Blu.
I:1982;4231;ray carries a lot of great special features.
I:1982;4232;I enjoy blocks of video and some picture.
I:1982;4233;I was very satisfied by Iron Man's behind the scenes peeks.
I:1982;4234;Behind the helmet, and outside of the helmet, Robert Downey Jr. does amazing justice to the character.
I:1982;4235;fest like most of the comic based movies, which is great.
I:1982;4236;The graphics are top notch.
I:1982;4237;the good part of it are, the story is actually entertaining, it has flynn from tron, great cg graphics.
I:1982;4238;robert downy jr. does a very good job playing annoying people.
I:1982;4239;he seems like a nice guy, and pulls off being ironman fairly well.
I:1982;4240;even makes his character appear to mature during the picture.
I:1982;4241;it is has a decent amount of tragedy, comedy and action.
I:1982;4242;It is the perfect blend of comedy, and a movie that stays true to the comic.
I:1982;4243;The special effects are great!
I:1982;4244;Jeff Bridges does a great job as the villian and I must say that the bald head looks cool as hell on him.
I:1982;4245;Even Pepper Potts is good.
I:1982;4246;I am not a fan of Paltrow but she is great in this part!GREAT!
I:1982;4247;With the major advances in special effects and CGI it was time to finally bring the true comic book character off the page and to the big screen accuratly.
I:1982;4248;Since then we have seen the amazing,(Spider.
I:1982;4249;(Batman Begins)Now a brand new experiment is about to take flight with a whole chain of movies linked together to culminate in what could be one of the highest grossing and most amazing films ever to hit the big screen.
I:1982;4250;This is the story of rich and powerful Tony Stark suddenly finding out he is extremly vulnerable due to a complication with his heart.
I:1982;4251;With this occurance Stark has an ephany and realizes there is more to life than power and he decides to use his power and inginuity to become a super hero.
I:1982;4252;Now he has created a powerful exo.
I:1982;4253;skeletal suit to keep him alive, but at the same time save the world and protect all that is good.
I:1982;4254;this movie is probably one of the best in the comic book film genre.
I:1982;4255;It has all the elements that make a film enjoyable.
I:1982;4256;An excellent origin story by director John Farravau.
I:1982;4257;A steller performance from Robert Downey Jr. and his supporting cast.
I:1982;4258;I watched this movie a few nights ago with my teenage son and really enjoyed it.
I:1982;4259;He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying.
I:1982;4260;"He uses this magnet in an invention, an ""Iron Man suit"", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them."
I:1982;4261;When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm.
I:1982;4262;He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool.
I:1982;4263;great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff.
I:1982;4264;And really really cool cars.
I:1982;4265;I love the suits, I love his cars, and I thought it all really well done.
I:1982;4266;One of the Best Comic genre movies to date, coming close to the caliber of the Dark Knight (which hails as the best comic book movie of all time).
I:1982;4267;I'm not a big Robert Downy, Jr. fan but he nails it in this movie.
I:1982;4268;"His interpretation of Tony Stark is the nearly the best coupling of actor to a comic book character yet
I:1982;4269;He even gets closer to his character than Christian Bale (which I have to say is the best Bruce Wayne to date).
I:1982;4270;Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect Pepper Potts, which, as this is a supporting role for her, points to her professionalism as one of the upper echelon of actors.
I:1982;4271;Of course, Jeff Bridges' performance is equally impressive.
I:1982;4272;The CG is impressive and not overdone.
I:1982;4273;The story is very well written staying true to the Iron Man mythos.
I:1982;4274;This is well worth your time and money.
I:1982;4275;I like how marvel tells the stories and brings them too life,please send more super hero, movies our way my family really enjoy this .
I:1982;4276;The one thing Iron Man has going for it is Robert Downey Jr who is just perfect for this role.
I:1982;4277;He is a natural and really embodies the character just right.
I:1982;4278;There is wit and charm and appeal.
I:1982;4279;this film, though fun at times did not spark my interest like The Dark Knight or even Transformers did.
I:1982;4280;Iron Man is certainly a very good comic book movie, far better than many I've seen, but certainly not the best.
I:1982;4281;It will appeal to many, mostly, again, because of the main character's likeability and the very nice special effects the film has to offer.
I:1982;4282;Was exactly what i ordered and in perfect condition.
I:1982;4283;All the disks play beautifully.
I:1982;4284;Dad of course was overwhelmingly happy with his present
I:1982;4285;Robert Downey Jr. is great in this movie.
I:1982;4286;He plays the character so well, you either love him or hate him!
I:1982;4287;Seeing this on the heels of watching the new James Bond Quantum of Solace and the re.
I:1982;4288;make of the Day The Earth Stood Still (two huge disappointments) Iron Man was a very pleasant surprise.
I:1982;4289;The film had plot, acting, dialogue, direction, special effects, humor .
I:1982;4290;It was a good movie but I do not really like super hero movies.
I:1982;4291;it was an okay movie though.
I:1982;4292;brilliant plot and more crucially the writing, which offers interest for both the children and the adults, despite being a a comic book hero.
I:1982;4293;Special effects carry the plot along nicely.
I:1982;4294;It's so nice to see some time a good movie like this.
I:1982;4295;second Star Wars film produce a fair number of giggles.
I:1982;4296;speakers convulsing in the aisles from laughter.
I:1982;4297;Suspension of disbelief is good enough here as you spend moments wondering what Tony Stark is going to do or say next.
I:1982;4298;A fun movie and the final big battle sequence does work so I leave the movie not scratching my head about details.
I:1982;4299;"Of all the comic book movies out there, ""Iron Man"" ranks as one of THE best."
I:1982;4300;Iron Man not only excels as a great super hero movie, but as a great movie.
I:1982;4301;Even though the plot is predictable and very simple, at the same time it's funny, dramatic, and it's full of heart, and it's all because we have a great story and a perfect cast to play it out.
I:1982;4302;Iron Man takes a modern approach to the origin of the hero.
I:1982;4303;but I will say the story plays out great, and we have some great acting from Downey, Jr. and Jeff Bridges.
I:1982;4304;Downey definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in this one.
I:1982;4305;"The special effects are fantastic
I:1982;4306;It's amazing how they actually built a functional Iron Man suit to use instead on relying solely on CGI.
I:1982;4307;The action sequences are beautifully orchestrated and there's not too much or too little.
I:1982;4308;There's plenty of laughs and many dramatic moments and again, I can't give the cast enough cred.
I:1982;4309;Plus, for fans of the comics, there an awesome scene at the end of the credits.
I:1982;4310;"This ""Ultimate 2 Disc Set"" delivers the goods."
I:1982;4311;The first disc features the main film in all its glory and the deleted/extended scenes that definitely needed to be cut.
I:1982;4312;The 2nd disc includes a great 7.
I:1982;4313;"part ""Making Of"" documentary that goes into great depth at the filmmaking process of Iron Man."
I:1982;4314;There's also a 45 minute documentary about the character's origins in the comics.
I:1982;4315;"And then, there's a funny clip from ""The Onion"" and some videos featuring some screen tests, a look at the visual effects, and photo galleries."
I:1982;4316;"Overall, ""Iron Man"" is a fantastic film and is a must see and it's worth watching over, and over, and over again!"
I:1982;4317;Right away we were impressed.
I:1982;4318;The menu alone is beautiful.
I:1982;4319;You can see grains of sand in the desert scenes.
I:1982;4320;live features also work well.
I:1982;4321;it's as good as theater.
I:1982;4322;With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark literally has a change of heart.
I:1982;4323;it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen.
I:1982;4324;It's one of the top notch transfers I've seen in recent years.
I:1982;4325;Audio is extremely active and is well used to put you into metal head's world.
I:1982;4326;the extras are stunning as well.
I:1982;4327;"We get a full documentary ""I AM Iron Man"" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre."
I:1982;4328;cGI work, design elements to on.
I:1982;4329;His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa.
I:1982;4330;We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out.
I:1982;4331;director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters.
I:1982;4332;"It may lack the darkness of ""The Dark Knight"" (that ""Iron Man"" is really Marvel's idea of ""Batman"" but a bit of irony thrown in for good measure except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the ""Spider."
I:1982;4333;"the nice thing about ""Iron Man"" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book)."
I:1982;4334;"house production ""Iron Man"" demonstrates that the comic book turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins."
I:1982;4335;"There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third ""Iron Man"" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of ""The Incredible Hulk""."
I:1982;4336;Great movie with a great plot.
I:1982;4337;Excellent acting + excellent cast = great movie!!
I:1982;4338;This is a very good and well done movie, which the whole family can enjoy.
I:1982;4339;This is my favorite movie in the marvel avengers series so far.
I:1982;4340;I thought I'd revisit this first Iron Man film for the third time.
I:1982;4341;It is still as enjoyable and entertaining as ever.
I:1982;4342;For example, the greatest leap of logic and destruction of reality.
I:1982;4343;Not only that, Obadiah INSTANTLY knows how to use his suit to it's full potential without a minute of practice, whereas Tony Stark (the genius, mind you) has had to futz and fiddle with his new creation and go through a very (entertaining) series of trial runs and must practice to learn how to use his new toy.
I:1982;4344;But, like I said, just go with the cartoon flow and you'll be all right.
I:1982;4345;The real fun of this movie is in the development and sessions where Stark is learning how to use his new suit.
I:1982;4346;centered superhero is just a complete hoot to watch.
I:1982;4347;Downey Jr. is a genuinely funny actor and can pull off those glib lines like few others actors can.
I:1982;4348;Which brings me to the writing: there's some really great dialogue in Iron Man and delivered wonderfully by all members of the cast.
I:1982;4349;Jeff Bridges is, of course, simply amazing as Obadiah, Stark's nemesis.
I:1982;4350;excellent film and it's always fun to go back to.
I:1982;4351;ray case is unique and cool!
I:1982;4352;Loved the movie and the easy downloading.
I:1982;4353;there're times NOTHING good is on.
I:1982;4354;i love my fav movies on my pc.
I:1982;4355;This is one of the best comics to movie adaptions I've seen yet.
I:1982;4356;I can't help but love Tony Stark and his personality.
I:1982;4357;This is a great setup for the Avengers (which is also an awesome movie)
I:1982;4358;I enjoy this film every time I watch it.
I:1982;4359;The action is just enough to please, and to leave the viewer wanting more.
I:1982;4360;Jeff Bridges rarely plays a villain, but turns out a believable performance that is a good counterpart to Downey's character.
I:1982;4361;Paltrow's take as Stark's assistant is the heart of the film.
I:1982;4362;It's witty and action packed.
I:1982;4363;Not a great thinking movie, but wonderful to sit down and watch with a family.
I:1982;4364;Was startled, cried, laughed, and cheared thoughout.
I:1982;4365;Robert Downey Jr. did and awesome job as Tony Stark.
I:1982;4366;The best way to describe this movie is very very simple.
I:1982;4367;If you are any kind of a fan of iron man you will love this movie.
I:1982;4368;They went a lil haywire with the special effects but stayed very true the story of the book while the writers made it their own in ways.
I:1982;4369;if your not a fan of comic books you should be they are what makes a childhood worth having.
I:1982;4370;well that and not having a job.
I:1982;4371;Anyways i want to say thank you to the writers and director and to Mr. Downey for making a childhood dream of mine come true.
I:1982;4372;Robert Downey Jr. does a great job, he mad the part of Ironman.
I:1982;4373;This is great but im giving it only 4 stars because there was a scuff mark on the face of the mask.
I:1982;4374;ray makes it all that much better.
I:1982;4375;Great movie, enjoyed teh story which was backed up by great sound effects.
I:1982;4376;Robert Downie Jr's best movie since Chaplin, just shows what a good script can do for your career.
I:1982;4377;Gwyneth Paltrow played her role as the female butler exceptionally well.
I:1982;4378;This comic book movie is one of the best superhero movies of the year, the best is The Dark Knight, but still I give it my highest rating.
I:1982;4379;For the sequel please put Mandarin in.
I:1982;4380;Great beginning with Tony Stark as the son of a Howard Hughes sort of genius.
I:1982;4381;The costume and special effects were great.
I:1982;4382;iron Man was very well done.
I:1982;4383;But that's a good thing because this film is set in the present time and it all makes sense in our world today.
I:1982;4384;It is also a commentary that a man can change his ways and make a difference in the world.
I:1982;4385;iron Man is a great companion film to Incredible Hulk.
I:1982;4386;it is best to watch Iron Man first and then Hulk because at the end of The Hulk Tony shows up and makes a comment eluding to the Avengers.
I:1982;4387;in one scene you can see Captain America's shield in Tony's workshop.
I:1982;4388;jeff Bridges is in great shape for his age and plays the ultimate villain,a backstabber!
I:1982;4389;Marvel is giving DC it's money's worth and is bringing the heat.
I:1982;4390;marvel and DC have been at it for years over the summer box office.
I:1982;4391;and that's okay because the fans are the real winners.
I:1982;4392;I loved it and I think it was the best action packed movie of 2008 beside Batman.
I:1982;4393;Standards have been rising in the comic adaptation genre, and the new Iron Man comes in at the top of the range.
I:1982;4394;This is one of the best comic adaptations ever, and a very good action flick in itself.
I:1982;4395;if the rest of the season's movies rise to this level, it's going to be a great year.
I:1982;4396;Plenty sets this apart from the pack.
I:1982;4397;Scripting offers a blend of humor, action, sneering bad guys, and simmering romance that's hard to beat.
I:1982;4398;"It gives Robert Downey Jr. lots to work with, including an outstanding aide in the form (the lovely form) of Paltrow's ""Pepper Potts."""
I:1982;4399;Even if it jumps the season by a few weeks, it's great summer fun.
I:1982;4400;This is an incredible entertainment but what really sets it apart is that showcases technology that will someday be possible.
I:1982;4401;There are companies right now [name deleted] that are working on systems that extend human ability beyond what our bones and muscle are designed to do.
I:1982;4402;This movie shows us that it's possible !!
I:1982;4403;Robert Downey as the narcissistic Tony Stark did a fantastic job portraying Iron Man in this movie.
I:1982;4404;The technology and action elements of the movie were entertaining, but the movie came alive thanks to the strong characters.
I:1982;4405;This is a terrific spectator movie.
I:1982;4406;A must see for all ages.
I:1982;4407;My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
I:1982;4408;We got this movie in a care package in Iraq.
I:1982;4409;Awesome movie, great action, it doesn't look fake or computer.
I:1982;4410;The story line is great, the visual effects are outstanding, and the suit is superb.
I:1982;4411;Great movie, and it didn't need crazy sex scenes to make it awesome.
I:1982;4412;Wouldn't have bought it if i didn't think so, Either way, great movie
I:1982;4413;Shellhead goes to the big screen courtesy of director Jon Favreau with a solid screenplay by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby.
I:1982;4414;"Yes, the movie is great and as with ""Spider."
I:1982;4415;"man 2"" as Marvel's best comic adaptation."
I:1982;4416;One day, fate intervenes and Stark finds himself captured and injured by terrorists.
I:1982;4417;mesh suit and becomes the ultimate human fighting machine.
I:1982;4418;The film carried a surmountable amount of teases that can have the avid comic fan very excited.
I:1982;4419;Writers Fergus and Ostby definitely did their homework on this one.
I:1982;4420;all these factors and the solid direction by Favreau makes for a very entertaining fun movie.
I:1982;4421;I didn't notice any plot holes at all and the execution is solid, the direction knew exactly what it wanted to do and sticks to it.
I:1982;4422;edged sword and I'll explain in a minute.
I:1982;4423;The film does have a strong moral message and a nice touch of humanity.
I:1982;4424;the film is also blessed with a great cast.
I:1982;4425;Downey does make a good Tony Stark, and the supporting cast does mesh well.
I:1982;4426;Tony is a playboy and boy, I was very amused by his escapades.
I:1982;4427;The action scenes are decently shot and the best one I think is Shellhead's invasion into enemy territory.
I:1982;4428;"Shellhead is a ""global"" super."
I:1982;4429;hero with concerns that surpass bank robberies and criminals.
I:1982;4430;"now, before anything else, let me make it very clear that I really thought that ""Iron Man"" is a great movie."
I:1982;4431;Great structure, AMAZING special effects that puts most CGI to shame and clever dialogue.
I:1982;4432;Some scenes proved too silly for my tastes but it was still entertaining.
I:1982;4433;"hero"" burnout, the villain becoming too routine and with the film being too ""safe"" for its own good, I really believe ""Iron Man"" is still a great effort in the super hero genre."
I:1982;4434;"At least, it knew what it wanted to do
I:1982;4435;Undoubtedly, this film will stand as one of the best super.
I:1982;4436;hero flicks to grace movie theaters.
I:1982;4437;good cast good movie fair price.
I:1982;4438;but the second is much better tho.
I:1982;4439;The video is quite impressive, so its the sound.
I:1982;4440;a fun movie to watch with friends.
I:1982;4441;Extras are good, Gag reel, documentaries, and Robert Downey jr. screen test among other things.
I:1982;4442;I love all the Iron Man movies, but the first is always going to be my favorite.
I:1982;4443;"My husband and I had seen Iron Man several years ago and enjoyed it
I:1982;4444;watching these movies with my kids.
I:1982;4445;Robert Downey, Jr. is such the perfect Iron Man just as Mark Ruffalo is the best Hulk.
I:1982;4446;but i loved Iron Man specially Iron Man Mini Bust.
I:1982;4447;i am a ve ry large marvel fan really good movie0p8IHghbi9hg .
I:1982;4448;Iron Man had all the qualities that made it an excellent movie great acting, effects, directing etc.
I:1982;4449;This movie is the best action film EVER!
I:1982;4450;The special effects were amazing, the plot was great, and the Iron Man suit was AWESOME!!!
I:1982;4451;I'll give a brief plot description for anyone who is not familiar with the comic book:WARNING: SPOILERSTony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is an American arms dealer who is fabulously wealthy and lives the high life.
I:1982;4452;Girls, booze, parties, he does it all.
I:1982;4453;Using the suit he escapes and creates a big scene that attracts the attention of the U. s. military.
I:1982;4454;He is rescued by the Air Force and returns home.
I:1982;4455;back in the States, Stark builds a sharp new Iron Man suit, and goes back to Afghanistan to rescue Dr. Yinsen's village from the terrorist group that had captured him.
I:1982;4456;he unravels the mystery with the help of Pepper Potts and decides he needs to change the mission of Stark Industries.
I:1982;4457;my husband dragged me to see this movie, and I ended up absolutely loving it.
I:1982;4458;"Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as always
I:1982;4459;The rest of the cast is very good in support of him.
I:1982;4460;"The score is fantastic too (I have already downloaded both ""Merchant of Death"" and ""Driving With the Top Down"" into my iPod)."
I:1982;4461;A good bit of it takes place in a war zone, and there is plenty of violence and some torture.
I:1982;4462;LOTS of fun, a rollercoaster ride, a rocking action movie with a sense of humor.
