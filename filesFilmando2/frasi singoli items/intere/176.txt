I:1773;1;There are so many familiar faces in this movie.
I:1773;2;I saw it years ago and am truly appreciating it again.
I:1773;3;Paul Scofield, John Hurt, Robert Shaw, Susannah York, Vanessa Redgrave and others star in this excellent adaptation of a play.
I:1773;4;A true story, one of a man's standing by his conscience and convictions.
I:1773;5;great story and shows how silence can speak louder rhan words.
I:1773;6;proves a lot about how one man can change the thinkingof and about religion.
I:1773;7;He recommends Richard to become a teacher.
I:1773;8;He has a visitor, a man who wants to marry his daughter.
I:1773;9;Winter brings a change to the Lord Chancellor .
I:1773;10;He visits Mores home and meets his family.
I:1773;11;The King and More talk in private.
I:1773;12;Will Roper wants to talk to More about a change in his opinion.
I:1773;13;Come with us for fellowship.
I:1773;14;Rich suggests a way to get More to talk.
I:1773;15;More speaks his last words.
I:1773;16;written and acted, with authentic costumes and sets leaves a series like The Tudors in the trash bin.
I:1773;17;Anyone with an active conscience asks himself what will happen to his character if he does what everyone at the office, school, or church is doing (i. e., going along with the party line on a particular matter) though his conscience shouts at him to do otherwise.
I:1773;18;is determined to take his advisors with him, and therefore demands universal complicity.
I:1773;19;are swept up as accomplices in his greatest crime.
I:1773;20;A man for all seasons is an amazing tale of a turbulent period in english history: The king, Henry VIII, is in love with a girl and want to finish his marriage to the queen.
I:1773;21;More is a humanist, lawyer, writer, filantropist and all around one of the most enlighted minds of the Renaissance, not to mention treasurer of the kingdom and personal friend to the king, but perhaps, more than anything: a profoundly devoted catholic.
I:1773;22;a fantastic performance by Paul Scofield as the disgraced but firm More, is the key to the whole movie.
I:1773;23;His estoic speech in front of the parliament is one for the ages.
I:1773;24;The matter of a man in firm defense of his principles and convictions is as valid today as it was 300 years ago and should be an example to people of all ages.
I:1773;25;A Man fo All Seasons is truly a movie everyone should see at least once in his life.
I:1773;26;I always wanted to see this film.
I:1773;27;I am a very happy customer.
I:1773;28;Thank you Amazon for keeping things within reach.
I:1773;29;The screenplay focuses very tightly on the battle between Henry VIII and Thomas More over divorce and Henry's bold acts to make him head of a new, non.
I:1773;30;It compresses the events of several years into a neat running time of just over 2 hours.
I:1773;31;Enjoyable as it is, it is just one view of Thomas Moore.
I:1773;32;Anyway, the Fred Zinnemann film is outstanding and endures the test of time.
I:1773;33;But Bolt is a supurb writer of human emotions.
I:1773;34;He's a good story teller and that's all that counts in the end.
I:1773;35;One of the greatest cinematic studies of the nature of personal integrity, I sometimes think that this film is in danger of being forgotten .
I:1773;36;what Robert Bolt and Fred Zinnemann had wrought is absolutely brought to glorious life by the incomparable characterization of Sir Thomas More by the chronically underrated Paul Scofield.
I:1773;37;"weather friend Richard Rich
I:1773;38;"out performances in relatively small but vital roles: Orson Welles, magnetic as the shrewdly pragmatic Cardinal Wolsey
I:1773;39;dominates the screen the two times he's on it.
I:1773;40;"as with ""The Lion in Winter,"" the remarkable scriptwriting is the driving force behind the story, but Scofield's dignified, restrained, but at the same time quietly forceful delivery are what give the writing its power."
I:1773;41;Whether criticized or praised as a morality play, it's wonderful to at least HAVE an uncompromising morality play to watch from time to time .
I:1773;42;Thomas More was as principled a man as history has ever known and this movie and the performances in it do him great justice.
I:1773;43;This Academy Award winning movie is a miracle.
I:1773;44;the costuming and settings in the movie are perfect, a huge departure from the costuming and makeup of other historical movies produced in the fifties and sixties.
I:1773;45;Another perfectly rendered component of A Man for All Seasons is the soundtrack.
I:1773;46;It is sparse and beautiful and truly evokes the historical period surrounding the events that lead to the split of the English Church from Rome and the subsequent execution of Sir Thomas.
I:1773;47;although this movie was not made to inspire in a religious sense, it is one of the best hagiographies ever made in any medium.
I:1773;48;It is, after all, the story of a man who is now a canonized Saint of the Catholic Church.
I:1773;49;told story with grace abounding everywhere.
I:1773;50;One of the most exquisite and heartrending scenes in the movie is the foreshadowing of the choices Henry makes .
I:1773;51;"This is a movie for anyone who enjoys outstanding acting, and it's a bonus ""two."
I:1773;52;"up"" for anyone who loves English history."
I:1773;53;family friendly without any gore.yet brutally honest.
I:1773;54;This is a story of a man prepared to offer his life for his convictions.
I:1773;55;If you like historical fiction, this is a good choice.
I:1773;56;Scofield plays Thomas More with great subtlety, and the viewer witnesses the essence of honor in his portrayal .
I:1773;57;a great actor in a great part.
I:1773;58;"Masterfully played by Oscar winner Paul Scofield, ""A Man for All Seasons"" is one of the ultimate ""period films"" of the era."
I:1773;59;Wonderful acting, writing, and direction make this movie a delight to watch.
I:1773;60;contrary to what the previous reviewer said about Thomas More, this saintly man was a paragon of virtue and courage.
I:1773;61;regarding the reading of William Tyndale's life, it is true he was a great scholar and translated the New Testament into English.
I:1773;62;"that fact notwithstanding, ""A Man for All Seasons is a spectacular film and well worth seeing again and again."
I:1773;63;I recently saw the Tudors and that got me very interested in Henry the VIII and his times.
I:1773;64;This movie is an excellent depiction of the religious and political issues of those times.
I:1773;65;great movie for all ages.
I:1773;66;Cast, scenery, music are simply outstanding.
I:1773;67;One of the best historical movie on Renaissance England.
I:1773;68;There's this school of thought that those who practice morality and reason, and stand their ground, can overcome the unscrupulousness of the moment.
I:1773;69;"I decided not to see it
I:1773;70;It was pure British art and culture piece.
I:1773;71;My first impression: Thomas More was a true hero.
I:1773;72;The most important advice Thomas More received by any of the character in the film.
I:1773;73;"note: regardless of my opinion of Thomas More or the film's theme, ""A Man For All Season,"" is perhaps the greatest film ever made, yes, even surpassing ""Citizen Kane."
I:1773;74;Director Fred Zinnemann's Academy Award winning masterpiece truly remains a film for all seasons.
I:1773;75;Paul Scofield gives an electrifying performance as heroic intellectual,Sir Thomas More.
I:1773;76;"very faithful screen play rendering by Robert Bolt of his equally superb play comprises ironically ""uncompromising""didactic entertainment."
I:1773;77;the film is illuminating study of what it means to be truthful,honorable and good.
I:1773;78;the film's ensemble cast is unquestionably one of the finest everarrayed.
I:1773;79;Wendy Hiller merits special note as Thomas'second wife, Lady Alice,whose love and courage strengthens her famous and brilliant husband to his task of ultimate sacrifice for CONSCIENCE.
I:1773;80;What does it profit a man to win the world,if he lose his immortal soul?
I:1773;81;But Director Zinnemann's epic telling of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS continues to ask.
I:1773;82;"MAN challenges the most obstinate,refined relativist, or dilettante DECONSTRUCTIONist to answer with honor
I:1773;83;what an overrated performance by Paul Scofield.
I:1773;84;Actually, I decided to see A Man for All Seasons for Robert Shaw, a very underrated actor, and as usual, he steals the show whenever he appears.
I:1773;85;And that's all about the film.
I:1773;86;He has always been a vastly overrated director, and he is awesome in bringing the mediocrity out of a film in the best way possible.
I:1773;87;If you want to see great acting, SEE THIS!
I:1773;88;It stands as a great film in its own right, not least because the filmmaker had the good sense to leave well enough alone.
I:1773;89;Film affords filmmakers the opportunity to 'improve' on the source material.
I:1773;90;It allows for framing and perspective changes, close.
I:1773;91;ups, points of view, cutaways, on.
I:1773;92;the performances are all superb.
I:1773;93;Paul Scofield deserves his Oscar for his performance as More.
I:1773;94;The supporting cast is just as good, but the performances, good as they are, serve to enhance the film, not define it.
I:1773;95;this is a film that deserves our appreciation because of what the filmmaker does not do.
I:1773;96;He resists melodrama, histrionics and embellishment.
I:1773;97;This film is like a fine French wine: Zinnemann went for refinement and subtlety over pizzazz.
I:1773;98;The filmmaker limits himself to showing us the life of a complex and fascinating man and has the good grace to leave the telling to Thomas More.
I:1773;99;This film is great because it has the wisdom to recognize that its subject matter is stronger than any modern film conventions and therefore adopts a non.
I:1773;100;interventionist and minimalist approach to the filmmaking.
I:1773;101;The result is a clean and unmannered film that achieves great dignity and clarity of purpose.
I:1773;102;If you are a fan of the time era, and people who lived then, get the film and enjoy!
I:1773;103;Robert Shaw, who was nominated for best supporting actor for this film, has one big scene!
I:1773;104;That is it, that is all!
I:1773;105;Perhaps it is more memorable that he was just in the one scene!
I:1773;106;But I will say, memorable throughout, and the dramatic music is still in my head.
I:1773;107;Watch and enjoy a classic.
I:1773;108;almost the best movie I have ever seen.
I:1773;109;"the script, filming, acting etc. are good
I:1773;110;at the beginning of the movie we see Thomas More speak disparagingly of Martin Luther in favor of the 'corrupt' Authorities of the Roman Catholic Church.
I:1773;111;and live successfuly, and die in our beds?It makes me wonder.
I:1773;112;It's one of those rare films that I can watch over and over and enjoy it as much each time.
I:1773;113;I had the delight of re.
I:1773;114;watching this fantastic movie the other night.
I:1773;115;It was like having a fine wine.
I:1773;116;this movie won an Oscar.
I:1773;117;It's easy to see why.
I:1773;118;Henry uses words and corrupt advisors to seal the fate of Sir Thomas Moore.
I:1773;119;"Robert Shaw was perfect as Henry VIII
I:1773;120;this movie is a rare gem.
I:1773;121;I do hope you enjoy it.
I:1773;122;An excellent example of 'stage to screen' transfer.
I:1773;123;The performances are top notch.
I:1773;124;The dialogue is sharp and witty and the film contains one of my favorite lines:Sir Thomas More: Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world.
I:1773;125;What a director: clean, straight and taut.
I:1773;126;clear plotting and staging: you know exactly what's going on all the time, and it grips with suspense from start to end.
I:1773;127;Shaw was wonderful as the king, especially in the manner he suggested inner insecurity, as well as self.
I:1773;128;Rich: knows precisely which side his bread is buttered on.
I:1773;129;blooded Duke has to stay that way.
I:1773;130;One of the finest things about the screenplay is that you don't have to be a Roman Catholic, or even a Christian, to admire More's character .
I:1773;131;Well, you just might imagine such a miracle, after seeing these performances.
I:1773;132;As a prelude to this, watch the Tudors for the very interesting backstory.
I:1773;133;"more was chancellor of England, a scholar, a wit, a legal expert, and a man with high principles
I:1773;134;paul Scofield is superb as More and gives a rock.
I:1773;135;solid performance of this iron.
I:1773;136;solid: at times he's a hero beyond human dimensions.
I:1773;137;The script, based on Robert Bolt's play, is also excellent .
I:1773;138;intelligent yet accessible, considering the subject and the time period.
I:1773;139;Not just a costume drama, it's a movie with real substance (a rare Hollywood trait today).
I:1773;140;A superb historical drama revolving around Henry VIII and his break with the Catholic Church over a refused marriage annulment, and his establishment of the Church of England.
I:1773;141;More is a quiet, steady pillar of strength as he defies Henry and his religious establishment plans.
I:1773;142;But More is a practical man, and a lawyer to boot, and defends himself in hair.
I:1773;143;The back and forth exchanges between More and Henry are brilliant, however.
I:1773;144;In fact, there's a great deal of intelligence in the movie (and a great deal of wit, too), yet the intellectual mental jousting is made to blend entertainingly with the drama unfolding on the screen.
I:1773;145;The movie makes you feel smart and entertained at the same time.
I:1773;146;The movie won a wagonload of Oscars, and deservedly so.
I:1773;147;Anyone interested in learning more about More and his fight with Henry should read Peter Ackroyd's excellent biography THE LIFE OF THOMAS MORE.
I:1773;148;"It is worth purchasing and watching with ""few"" distractions."
I:1773;149;He was once more appealing to him for his support in obtaining a divorce from the Pope so that the King could marry Anne Boleyn.
I:1773;150;This comes frequently with tremendous pressure to conform to public opinion.
I:1773;151;We see this unfold with a tremendous buildup that keeps us immersed as the resultant outcome of the plot unfurls, which is great even if we know the story.
I:1773;152;I prefer to think that most will benefit from the opposite response, seeing that: this movie has much to teach us.
I:1773;153;You might also enjoy the movieRomero, a man made from a mold similar to Sir Thomas More's.
I:1773;154;The film came as promised, was in good shape and it brought back pleasant memories of a movie day at the theatre some 48 yrs ago.
I:1773;155;These will likely come to NYC and I thought I'd like to revisit the time period again.
I:1773;156;The best way to view this movie is to read the book before viewing.
I:1773;157;Your production of a Man for All Seasons was marvelous.
I:1773;158;I thought this moving told a story, delivered a message, and made me think about the message.
I:1773;159;It's an old movie but I would recommend it.
I:1773;160;How very refreshing to hear heresy denounced by its rightful name in this film!
I:1773;161;The film should be required viewing for all catechumens
I:1773;162;"Superb performances, an intelligent script and exceptional cinematography and editing make ""A Man For All Seasons"" indeed an Oscar."
I:1773;163;Nevertheless, Paul Scofield is a convincing Moore martyred for his steadfast belief in Catholicism and papal authority.
I:1773;164;A young John Hurt, Corin Redgrave and Vanessa Redgrave are also a delight to see in their early acting careers.
I:1773;165;"If you enjoy great acting, great scripts and great photography ""A Man For All Seasons"" is a film for all seasons to watch."
I:1773;166;I had to write a paper of philosophy and the move helped me to understand the main points in the movie and characters.
I:1773;167;A Man for All Seasons is a thought provoking and inspiring film about Thomas Moore.
I:1773;168;This movie, inspires one to ask questions about their own faith in God and the virtues that they hold for themselves.
I:1773;169;Thought you'd be interested in knowing: I travel through Iran a lot, and this thing is always on TV dubbed into Farsi.
I:1773;170;Why does the Iranian government love this film so much?Chiefly, as it has been explained to me (and I believe), this is because More is the perfect mullah.
I:1773;171;If you can get around the fact that the doesn't have a beard and that he's Christian, he has the exact kind of personality they admire: completely unflinching on matters of religion, even when the entire world is against you and your life is on the line.
I:1773;172;more, at least as depicted in this film, was willing to scuttle friendships, family relations, his fortune, his career, etc. all for a point of dogma .
I:1773;173;shade your enjoyment of the film, causing you to question whether, despite Scofield's masterly interpretation, More's honor is really worth your admiration.
I:1773;174;Well acted screen drama with strong overtones for today's world.
I:1773;175;The need for law as the primary means of protecting all members of society from the ravages of people of power is aptly illustrated in this movie.
I:1773;176;i suggest this movie would make an excellent item of study for all social studies classes as well as law.
I:1773;177;Besides the wonderful language which forcibly reminds me of the paucity of most modern day speech, the glorious costumes settings.
I:1773;178;one of the greatest joys is the music.
I:1773;179;georges Delarue's adds another layer to the rich tapestry of this film.
I:1773;180;The story is based on reality and gives us an example of conviction and moral steadfastness.
I:1773;181;Robert Bolt's screenplay is the most literary and historically accurate period dialogue imaginable.
I:1773;182;The actors who portrayed the characters did a wonderful job.
I:1773;183;He was an honest, moral man who stayed with what he believed was right.
I:1773;184;He depicts a good example of how people should act.
I:1773;185;I would only recommend this movie to people who would like to go back to this era in time.
I:1773;186;it was well worth seeing again, and doesn't seem dated like many movies from that time.
I:1773;187;Paul Scofield gave an impeccable and unforgettable performance as the upright, well.
I:1773;188;His face was that of a man with intelligence, integrity and principles.
I:1773;189;His meticulous and knowledgeable speech revealed his law expertise.
I:1773;190;Though Charles Laughton was famous in his role as King Henry VIII, Robert Shaw pulled off an impressive performance as a self.
I:1773;191;the heartbreaking scenes and unforgettable diaglogues include his parting with his family in the Tower.
I:1773;192;I have married a lion,  exclaimed Thomas.
I:1773;193;Susannah York was excellent as More's brave and intelligent daughter.
I:1773;194;Thomas's conversation with Richard Rich(John Hurt), the young and compromised betrayer, and Cromwell(Leo McKern), the persistent persecutor, were always dangerous.
I:1773;195;The unsolved puzzle was whether and how Thomas's death affected the world, particularly Rich in his later life as the chancellor of the UK.
I:1773;196;the movie was about a man of great principles.
I:1773;197;Brilliant script/screen adaption of a West End play with a great cast.
I:1773;198;for most of the piece Paul Scofield as More eludes his enemies in Henry's court by parsing his language and word play and, as a result, it is a great period flick on points of law.
I:1773;199;He is ultimately tripped up on a minor point and, once his fate is sealed, he reveals his true feelings and makes a great case for a man being true to himself even in the face of great peril.
I:1773;200;Great morality play, one of the best.
I:1773;201;Leo McKern as the dogged and clever Thomas Cromwell, and a young John Hurt as the fictional but essential and pitiable stooge Richard Rich, are standouts.
I:1773;202;a Man For All Seasons deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and it holds up to repeated viewings.
I:1773;203;Still, the movie is great enough without.)
I:1773;204;No wonder this movie won so many awards!
I:1773;205;Sir (Saint) Thomas More is portrayed very well in this movie as he silently resists King Henry the 8th's forceful institution of the Church of England.
I:1773;206;power and finally finds himself in the Tower of London.
I:1773;207;"The 1967 best picture Oscar winner ""A Man for All Seasons"" is an impeccably acted movie version of the acclaimed Robert Bolt play."
I:1773;208;The action surrounds the refusal of Sir Thomas More, an exalted and atypically honest jurist and author played wonderfully by Paul Scofield, to accept and bless the divorce of King Henry VIII and his subsequent marriage to Anne Boleyn.
I:1773;209;"for those movie aficionados of superb acting performances ""A Man for All Seasons"" would be a treat."
I:1773;210;The period costuming, sets and cinematography were all excellent and deserving of the Oscars that they garnered.
I:1773;211;Director Fred Zinnemann's transformation of the Bolt play to the screen was very well done indeed.
I:1773;212;this film answers all the what how and why of perfect movie.
I:1773;213;I have loved this movie since I saw it in its original release too many years ago.
I:1773;214;He was much more complex in real life than the purely noble performance of Paul Scofield.
I:1773;215;but this is a wonderful movie and I recommend it with great enthusiasm.
I:1773;216;It is a powerful movie and can have some useful at least temporary curative effect on the soul suffering under the ironical detachment and cynicism of our time.
I:1773;217;Scofield is wonderful and the definitive performance of this role.
I:1773;218;John Hurt is superb as the traitor Richard Rich.
I:1773;219;Shaw is fine as Henry VIII as is the rest of the cast.
I:1773;220;and who can forget the line where More asks to see chain of office that Richard Rich was given to perjure himself and betray More.
I:1773;221;"the disk offers the wide screen theatrical release and a full screen version for those who like to see less of the picture in order to avoid the upper and lower ""bars""."
I:1773;222;There is also the original trailer.
I:1773;223;perfect rendering of Robert Bolt play.
I:1773;224;Dazzling performances by Scofield and Shaw, with Leo McKern and John Hurtproviding exceptionally good support.
I:1773;225;A believable examination oflust for power and obedience to a morally corrupt ruler for personal gain or protection.
I:1773;226;More comes off as a true modern man, who places his personal beliefs and adherence to his morality above allegience to temporal government, as well as above personal gain or loss, even to the acceptance of death.
I:1773;227;A fine retelling of the conflict of a saint and martyr of the Catholic church, but with much food for thought for the atheist as well.
I:1773;228;Gorgeous cinematography and excellent musical score and costumes round out the picture.
I:1773;229;I remember seeing this movie, at my mother's insistence, when I was in the 7th grade.
I:1773;230;I also saw the play performed some years later at the Oregon Shakespearean Festival.
I:1773;231;At any rate, it made a big impression on me.
I:1773;232;but it really is timeless.
I:1773;233;Paul Scofield was excellent in addition to the entire cast.
I:1773;234;A fuller portrait is found in Peter Ayckroyd's excellent biography of a few years ago.
I:1773;235;"He's quite a bit younger in this film
I:1773;236;He is perfectly cast as Sir Thomas More.
I:1773;237;And, all the supporting cast are outstanding.
I:1773;238;i recommend to any who are interested in the specific subject matter, church history, or enjoy films based on true stories.
I:1773;239;"'A Man for All Seasons' is well written and acted
I:1773;240;Now that I'm older and wiser, I was able to appreciate this film a lot more.
I:1773;241;It is a wonderful character study of a man with impeccable character, Sir Thomas More, a man who stood by his beliefs even though it would cost him his life.
I:1773;242;paul Schofield's performance is superb, and the costumes in this film are magnificent.
I:1773;243;I recommend it to anyone interested in seeing an example of someone standing up for what he believes in.
I:1773;244;I like a lot the way Fred Zinnemann describes this antagonism by opposing during the whole film More's well.
I:1773;245;The dilemma in making a film about the saintly is to not come of as sanctimonious and Zinnemann and his actors accomplish the trick.
I:1773;246;This is a film that translates it's ideas with great subtlely, winning it's audience over on the importance of abiding to your conscience.
I:1773;247;This is helped by a powerhouse performance by Scofield who doesn't overplay the part but is steadfast in his beliefs.
I:1773;248;This film is deserving of the best picture Oscar that it won and it demonstrates that you can make a film about high ideals and there is an audience receptive to it.
I:1773;249;There can be little argument about the merit of this film winning the 1966 Best Picture award.
I:1773;250;The acting is superb, the authenticity is extraordinary, and the dialogue is absolutely captivating.
I:1773;251;Paul Scofield gives perhaps the best acting performance in the history of cinema.
I:1773;252;I have an addendum to this review that is an important note.
I:1773;253;"i just saw ""A Man For All Seasons"" (Fred Zinnemann's 1966 version) and thoroughly enjoyed it."
I:1773;254;I highly recommend this film esp.
I:1773;255;Paul Scofield was just a grand Sir (Saint) Thomas More in this movie.
I:1773;256;But enough said, its a great movie!
I:1773;257;Period dramas are one of my favorites.
I:1773;258;Despite its failure to depict Sir Thomas More as a more complex character, who indeed, did preside over the executions of Protestants,as many previous reviewers of this piece have mentioned, I give this effort, which ushered in the Tudor England film genre of the 1960s and early '70s, five stars for Fred Zinneman's onscreen depiction of one of the best plays in the English language.
I:1773;259;georges Delerue's magnificent score and Ted Moore's brilliant cinematography bolster and help recapture the 16th century setting of Robert Bolt's screenplay, taken from the latter's own stage production.
I:1773;260;zinneman, Bolt, and Moore showed themselves as visual oarsmen, who, like the boatmen on the Thames featured in this film, take viewers on a journey of the salient points of More's life,which to say the least,was no Utopia.
I:1773;261;his trial is the climax of the film, and the dialogue is at once intense, inspirational, and stirring.
I:1773;262;strangely disassociated images, as a noteworthy life awaits a graphic end.
I:1773;263;A 1966 period movie with a true story about a man who stands up against powerful King Henry VIII and many others for his moral beliefs in regard to divorce.
I:1773;264;The stand Thomas More takes complicates his life in many ways, including his family and friends.
I:1773;265;More is an influential man of some means who was high in the leadership of England at that time.
I:1773;266;once you see it, you will know why it won so many awards, including best picture, and best actor.
I:1773;267;(Paul Scofield)The expressions alone on Scofield's face are very fine acting.
I:1773;268;this movie helps you see the difference between public and private beliefs.
I:1773;269;other than Paul Scoffield's absolutely BRILLIANT performance, the other performance which shines through is that of a young, handsome John Hurt playing Richard Rich.
I:1773;270;"Some of the greatest lines/scenes in this incredibly intelligent, clever film:Richard Rich: ""I'm not depressed."
I:1773;271;As an another reviewer pointed out, More's greatest line in the film: Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to lose his soul for the whole world.
I:1773;272;The movie is even better than the play itself, as the film refines certain elements (i. e., omits Chapuys's character, streamlines the relationship with Rich).
I:1773;273;since the play is quite brilliant and in no need of change .
I:1773;274;so fans of the play will be surprised and pleased at how little the lines were changed.
I:1773;275;"Other than ""The Passion of the Christ"", it's my favorite film."
I:1773;276;Very good movie, wasn't expecting much.
I:1773;277;One of the best films ever made .
I:1773;278;superb screen play and great acting.
I:1773;279;I find this a very inspiring and uplifting film.
I:1773;280;To me, it was a good movie, but not a great one.
I:1773;281;I understand it is an adaptation of a stage play and I think this might be where it suffers a bit.
I:1773;282;Nevertheless, this movie is an interesting study about a man, a product of his era, who adhered to and was willing to die for a belief in a principle rather than succumb to absolute authority.
I:1773;283;The script and the acting are outstanding throughout, including Wendy Hiller in her lesser role.
I:1773;284;If, however an individual desires to see drama at its best, something that stimulates thought, I enthusiatically recommend this film, not only for the acting and script but because it is an effective reminder of the challenge and importance of upholding valid principles.
I:1773;285;Also, it's refreshing to see a movie in which the hero speaks in eloquent Englsh rather than the dismal street patois that has infected so many movies over the past 30 years and become the norm.
I:1773;286;She was able to produce an heir .
I:1773;287;this is an engrossing movie that accurately represents the historical facts, as far I know them.
I:1773;288;This is an excellent movie with a gripping story, very convincingly acted, and atmospherically produced and directed by Fred Zinnemann.
I:1773;289;Moore, a devout and relentlessly honest man, resists the King's demand.
I:1773;290;A Man for All Seasons poses a number of provocative moral challenges, not least the sagacity of Moore's refusal to bend to the King, at the cost of his life and his family's welfare.
I:1773;291;This refusal makes for a cleaner but less historically accurate story lineThis movie is very highly reocmmended as a superbly done drama, still worth watching all these many years later.
I:1773;292;The book is simply stunning.
I:1773;293;perfect adaptation, in my mind.
I:1773;294;The movie stayed true to the meaning of the book, which is more than you can say for some adaptations.
I:1773;295;i would recommend this to anyone who has read the book, anyone interested in that period of England's history, or anyone who finds stories of man against the system moving and inspiring.
I:1773;296;Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?ROPER I'd cut down every law in England to do that!MORE Oh?
I:1773;297;"Almost all talk but never ""talky"", this is still one of the finest stage adaptations ever."
I:1773;298;We enjoy Robert Bolt's rarefied language, but the story moves with crisp economy.
I:1773;299;brow fun of Showtime's The Tudors, may whet the appetite for additional prospective on the drama's action, but the focus on Moore's fate resonates in each new era as the title suggests.
I:1773;300;Marvelous British cast directed with Fred Zinneman's austere understatement.
I:1773;301;This marks the first great performance by John Hurt, and fans of Rumpole will marvel that Leo McKern plays one of the most hateful prosecutors imaginable.
I:1773;302;Orson, the lone American is completely convincing without ladling on the English accent.
I:1773;303;(And why doesn't the great beauty and fine actress Susannah York ever get her due?)
I:1773;304;"the picture is crisp and the sound is perfect, which added to my enjoyment as I kicked back to watch ""A Man For All Seasons"" one more time."
I:1773;305;included in this version is a brief documentary about the life of St. Thomas More.
I:1773;306;It was both informative and entertaining.
I:1773;307;even if you are not already a fan of the Tudors or Thomas More, check out the The Best Picture of 1966 and treat yourself to some wonderful performances by Wendy Hiller, Robert Shaw, Orson Wells and Paul Scofield in the title role.
I:1773;308;The screenplay and the cast are sublime, but really, they could make a reel of just Paul Scofield delivering his lines, and it would be better than many films that have won Oscars.
I:1773;309;take it from someone who has seen every film through Argo that won Best Picture at the Oscars.
I:1773;310;I never had the chance to see this film on the big screen.
I:1773;311;on so many fronts, what a film!
I:1773;312;It is beautifully filmed and what a cast!
I:1773;313;He does great justice to the transformation of Richard Rich from friend to opportunist.
I:1773;314;Susannah York is superb as Margaret, and what can one say about Paul Scofield's performance but brilliant?This film is a truly great one in that it is not only about the political rise and fall of figures in the erratic times of Henry VIII, but more a story of human beings, principles, integrity, honour, and strength.
I:1773;315;This is a true masterpiece!
I:1773;316;This is a movie every Christian should watch!
I:1773;317;My fiancee and I watched it and have shared it with our loved ones.
I:1773;318;In fact, I watch it every few years, to check my moral compass.
I:1773;319;The acting is wonderful, the dialogue is thought.
I:1773;320;provoking and memorable, the cinematography is lush, especially for the time.
I:1773;321;Most of all, of course, the story is compelling.
I:1773;322;i think it may be especially enjoyable for attorneys.
I:1773;323;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:1773;324;The writing and acting are superb!
I:1773;325;One man stands up for what he feels is right.
I:1773;326;A must see film!I'd recommend it to a friend.
I:1773;327;The film is perfect, especiallythe visual symbolism which adds to the perfect screenplay.
I:1773;328;"paul Scofield is one of the greatest actors ever captured on film
I:1773;329;the conflict between King Henry VIII, played by Robert Shaw and Sir Thomas More, masterfully played by Paul Scofield is superb.
I:1773;330;After the fall of Thomas Wolsey in 1529, King Henry VIII makes More his Lord Chancellor, a position that holds great power.
I:1773;331;This is a film that has stood the test of time and offers a tender and reasonably accurate historical account of the life of a man whose principles could not be bought.
I:1773;332;I kept wanted to shout at the Paul Schofield/Thomas Moore character: For god's sake, let Bluff King Hal have his divorce if he wants it!
I:1773;333;He's got plenty more lead in his pencil and no heir!
I:1773;334;Robert Shaw is wonderfully hammy as the frustrated Henry VIII.
I:1773;335;It will make you a better human.
I:1773;336;He always did outstanding work as in this case!!!
I:1773;337;A classic for all seasons!
I:1773;338;Based on Robert Bolt's play, this is a marvelous work.
I:1773;339;Shot on location with wonderful period costumes.
I:1773;340;there is a great line where More asks Henry.
I:1773;341;What's more to the purpose, you're known to be honest.
I:1773;342;this movie should be required viewing and learning by anyone who reaches for the brass ring of politics.
I:1773;343;So I'm very happy with it.
I:1773;344;Thomas Moore epitomizes ethical choice and is an example to follow for the ages.
I:1773;345;Near perfect balance between ambition and morality.
I:1773;346;paul Scofield delivers a masterful convincing delivery of both the human weakness and moral strength that made up Thomas Moore.
I:1773;347;A timeless lesson for the ages.
I:1773;348;This film is a great example of the saying that a great script is what makes a film great and Robert Bolt's excellent screenplay comes to life in spectacular manner in this film.
I:1773;349;"For Catholics who are jaded or have somehow forgotten the significance of their faith will find this film together with ""The Song of Bernadette"" to be very encouraging as it reminds us of just how precious the faith was to our ancestors of the faith who were willing to sacrifice their lives to ensure that doctrinal purity is preserved for posterity."
I:1773;350;Having also read St. Thomas More's written works and especially those written during his captivity in the the Tower of London, I've grown to really respect this great man whose superior intellect is evident in his very lucid and considered writing style.
I:1773;351;this is a good film and a deserving best Oscar winner for 1966 although you may want to wait for an improved restored Blu.
I:1773;352;"I recommend this movie to anyone who believes in God
I:1773;353;This is without a doubt my favorite movie.
I:1773;354;It is a magnificent tribute to conscience in the face of political power.
I:1773;355;"Films such as this are rare today
I:1773;356;however, it is one of the best film ever produced.
I:1773;357;the whole tone of the film is excellent.

I:1773;359;The cinematographer, Ted Moore, as well as the director received Academy Awards for their work.

I:1773;366;"good movie
I:1773;367;Yet it is a meaningful and stunning film, and one deserving of viewing by all.
I:1773;368;Superbly acted and directed, it's no wonder this film garnered all awards!
I:1773;369;After having viewed this film, Richard Burton remarked, I have always wanted to be the greatest actor ever to have lived, and I believed I was until I saw Paul Scofield in, A Man For All Seasons !
I:1773;370;This film is a MUST in your library of classics!
I:1773;371;A Man for All Seasons directed by Fred Zinnemann, is a splendid Oscar winning film about Sir Thomas More's refusal to help King Henry VIII break with the Catholic Church and form The Church of England.
I:1773;372;"Paul Scofield is magnificent in a title role as a man of a brilliant mind, high honor, unbending will, and integrity
I:1773;373;directed by two times Oscar Winner, Fred Zinnemann and written by Robert Bolt, the picture benefits from the all stars supporting cast including Robert Shaw, Orson Welles, Wendy Hiller, Susannah York, and John Hurt.
I:1773;374;biography, it is one of the best courtroom dramas I've seen.
I:1773;375;Although some of the gnarlier and less attractive facets of More's personality are glossed over in this film, Paul Scofield's performance is masterful and the movie never fails to move and inspire me.
I:1773;376;The supporting cast is equally fine, with a terrifying performance by Robert Shaw as Henry VIII.
I:1773;377;the strength of the movie is the steady and restrained and often with intelligent wit, with which Scofield carried the role.
I:1773;378;The research work by Bolt is commendable too.
I:1773;379;This movie and A Lion in Winter are 2 of my favorite movies set in the past.
I:1773;380;By the end of the movie you feel great sympathy with Sir Thomas and even though you know the end of the story you start to hope we will make it out alive.
I:1773;381;the sceanery is great as well
I:1773;382;haven't watched it yet but Paul Greenberg wrote it was a good story and that's good enough for me.
I:1773;383;A truly great one for sure.
I:1773;384;and customs (you can easily tell they have never been worn until right before the movie was shot) but the performances and screenplay are simply fantastic.
I:1773;385;I read somewhere that Steven Spielberg hired Robert Shaw for JAWS after seeing this movie and it's easy to notice a similarity in his work on both films.
I:1773;386;Bought this film because it's an Academy Award winner for Best Picture of 1966.
I:1773;387;A Man For All Season is a political drama, recounting the story of the statesman Sir Thomas More (with an Academy Award winning performance by Paul Scofield).
I:1773;388;Elevated to the position of Lord Chancellor of England to King Henry VIII, Thomas More finds himself at the heart of the struggle between church and state.
I:1773;389;The politics and characters are somewhat complex, but the character of Thomas More stands out as an inspiring light.
I:1773;390;When the whole world stands against him, he stands up for the truth as a witty and compelling lawyer, even if it means losing his income, prestige, family, and life.
I:1773;391;"law Rich, who is a prime example of the spineless thinking of those whose opinion varies as soon the wind of political change blows ( ""Why, Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world ."
I:1773;392;I die the King's good servant.
I:1773;393;In the final analysis, the eloquent word usage actually raises the movie to a higher level, and the wit and articulation probably serves to increase appreciation with repeated viewing.
I:1773;394;"A rarity in comparison to most modern movies, there is little objectionable content (besides a few incidences of blasphemy such as ""Goddammit"")."
I:1773;395;There are also some moments of beautiful filming.
I:1773;396;This movie gathered six Academy Awards in 1966, including best picture, best actor, and best director.
I:1773;397;It is certainly dated, both in terms of the possibilities of movie.
I:1773;398;But the idea of standing up for your principles is a timeless characteristic that should be a goal for us all.
I:1773;399;"In an age of where lawyers and statesmen have little respect, ""A Man For All Seasons"" offers something for all of us to aspire to."
I:1773;400;A Man for All Seasons is an unusually sophisticated and intelligent film, with some of the very best acting that you will ever see in a movie.
I:1773;401;developing an appreciation for history.
I:1773;402;This is a quiet gem of a film, beautifully understated and quite moving by the end.
I:1773;403;The performances are superlative here, especially Paul Scofield as Thomas More.
I:1773;404;The film was directed by Fred Zinneman, and his direction is so understated, quiet, and un.
I:1773;405;It is incredibly subtle, and the film really benefits from it.
I:1773;406;"Flashy camera moves and overbearing music (usually thrown in to say to the viewer ""this is a moving part"") always detract from a great story, and the story here is so powerful that no other attention getting devices are needed."
I:1773;407;Zinneman should be commended for this, and the Academy awarded him Best Director for his efforts.
I:1773;408;The screenplay is by Robert Bolt, one of the greatest playwrights/screenwriters of all time.
I:1773;409;His script is (like all his work) incredibly literate, intelligent, and filled with wonderful dialogue.
I:1773;410;Everything is this film works brilliantly.
I:1773;411;I first saw this movie in a theater when it was first released, and it holds up extremely well over time.
I:1773;412;The acting is wonderful across the board and it is interesting to see a young John Hurt in a supporting role.
I:1773;413;The story of Thomas More often gets lost in the shadow of the Henry VIII/Anne Boleyn mess, but Thomas More was for a time the conscience of England, and Paul Scofield does a masterful job of showing the conflict between More's duty to his God and to his King.
I:1773;414;One of the greatest movie's and stories of true virtue, honor and holiness of our times.
I:1773;415;thomas Moore is a true Christian hero and saint.
I:1773;416;it is also one of the greatest acting performances of all time delivered by none other than the great Paul Scofield.
I:1773;417;The perfect movie, played by the perfect actor to show the greatness and the perfection of him who is St. Thomas Moore.
I:1773;418;This movie was such a fascinating study.
I:1773;419;This is a classic and Paul Scofield is an actor's actor.
I:1773;420;i have the same film with Charleton Heston and it is good but Scofield is tops.
I:1773;421;The outstanding stature of this film makes of this work one of the top twenty best of the Decade.
I:1773;422;six Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor, Director, Screenplay to Bolt (Lawrence of Arabia),cinematography and Costumes.
I:1773;423;Maybe, and making an imagination exercise: Joseph Fiennes, Jessic Lange, Anthony Hopkins, Robert Duvall, Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Audrey Tautoo and Kristyn Scott Thomas and Director I would bet for Anthony Minghella.
I:1773;424;Every actor in this movie delivers a fantastic performance that the people they play in the movie would be quite proud of them.
I:1773;425;This movie deserves the 5 stars I gave it, and the Oscars it won.
I:1773;426;Paul Scofield, although he doesn't resemble the real Thomas More in appearence, delivers a spectacular performance, perfectly capturing Thomas More's personality that is known throughout history.
I:1773;427;Susannah York is brilliant in her role as Margaret Roper, Thomas More's beloved daughter, and she is quite pretty also.
I:1773;428;Yes I thought ironically that's me!
I:1773;429;we even did a performance in the round at All Hallows Church, in sight of the Tower and the film was obviously very much to the fore when we did our production.
I:1773;430;the intelligent comments from other reviewers I agree with especially the point that this film is about a man who tries to bend without breaking his inner religous beliefs but cannot deny his soul in the end.
I:1773;431;Yes this does seems like a play with lovely location shots at times but in the interest of integrity, fiction should not be mixed into fact (faction) a la Titanic (1997) just to pull in those with a low attention span.
I:1773;432;this film was easily the best film for that year and richly deserved the Oscar.
I:1773;433;What I found engaging about this and the other films is that the music, the costuming, cinematography, settings and especially the vernacular had a ring of truth, authenticity and credibility about them.
I:1773;434;"Moreover, in ""A Man For All Seasons"", actor Paul Scofield brings a believable sense of righteous, elegant dignity to his portrayal of Sir Thomas More, which perfectly offsets the misogynistic, tyrannical maniac that is Henry VIII (well played by Robert Shaw)."
I:1773;435;Paul Scofield is phenomenal, and the dialogue is just as good.
I:1773;436;There is some beautiful cinematography, despite the fact that it's very stagey in many ways.
I:1773;437;Nice to watch back to back with The Lion in Winter.
I:1773;438;a fine cast, great costumes, a fine screenplay, solid music all make for a film classic.
I:1773;439;orson Welles plays a marvelous corrupt and corpulent cardinal of the church.
I:1773;440;He is not on screen long but he does a fine job of portraying a church that is more interested in being expedient than being steadfast in the tenets of the church.
I:1773;441;this film is quite well acted by a stellar cast including Robert Shaw, John Hurt, Leo McKern and Paul Schofield as More.
I:1773;442;This story is a study in integrity, and an uncompromising sense of ethics and loyalty to religious tradition.
I:1773;443;this is a period piece set in the early to mid 1500's.
I:1773;444;com was flawless and inexpensive.
I:1773;445;"the profound utterances by Thomas More, in response to the craven ""just sign the paper and save your neck"" urgings of the rest of the cast, up to the final scene in which he is betrayed in a kangaroo court by false testimony from a weak and cowardly character is absolutely classic, absolutely political, and absolutely modern."
I:1773;446;A wonderful story and one that is inspirational.
I:1773;447;This version of the story does it great justice, showing Henry VIII for the tyrant he really was (although one who could be charming when he wanted to be) and the characters he surrounded himself with.
I:1773;448;The actors chosen for the roles in this film included many established actors as well as some very talented ones just making their mark.
I:1773;449;have enjoyed this for years .
I:1773;450;But the side that the movie portrays is accurate, as Sir Thomas deeply loved his family and believed in educating both his son and his daughters (he had six girls: Three were his own, two were adopted, and one became his ward and later married his son).
I:1773;451;Sir Thomas also displayed a flashing wit that could run the gamut from light.
I:1773;452;Orson Welles is perfect as Henry VIII's right.
I:1773;453;Wendy Hiller is delightfully gruff as Dame Alice More, Susannah York is radiant as Sir Thomas's daughter Margaret More, and Colin Redgrave is great as Margaret's outspoken suitor Will Roper.
I:1773;454;5 Stars for this film because it is so captivating, watching the story unfold bit by bit.
I:1773;455;This is an 1966 movie I recommend to anyone interested in Church and Christian History.
I:1773;456;It's amazing to think on how our English Bibles came to be during the actual years that this movie portrays.
I:1773;457;What a depiction of the Life of St. Thomas More.
I:1773;458;Fast Shipping and will watch on the feast day of St. Thomas More!
I:1773;459;The movie is as good now as when it first came out.
I:1773;460;I wasn't sure that would be the case, and I was pleasantly surprised.
I:1773;461;"A classic
I:1773;462;Good for history students who may be interested in the beginnings of Protestantism and the reasons that lay behind its spread in England .
I:1773;463;I love this story, and this is a great portrayal.
I:1773;464;I teach the play in my English classes and it always fosters great discussions.
I:1773;465;Still, I recommend this production wholeheartedly.
I:1773;466;I'm a History buff and love movies like this.
I:1773;467;It's fantastic, such incredible performances.
I:1773;468;I was mesmerized till the very end and what an ending it is!
I:1773;469;Paul Scofield became one of my favorite actors after I saw this movie and of course I've always been a fan of Robert Shaw and Orson Welles!
I:1773;470;This movie is an extremely deep film, which shows the 7 Virtues.
I:1773;471;The actors performance in this film was believable and made it visible for me to see what a moral man, and a loyal servent to God More was, and how he really lived.
I:1773;472;The staging of the film was very well done and the actors really played their parts well.
I:1773;473;After seeing this movie, I have more of an understanding on what a strong person Thomas More was, and how much faith he had in God
I:1773;474;"otherwise, the play and screenplay are brilliant
I:1773;475;This film is some of the best work hollywood has to offer.
I:1773;476;The exciting story of Sir Thomas Moore and his strength to hold on to his principles.
I:1773;477;It is a story of a man who truly knew who he was and what he stood for and the journey he went through to stand up for what he believed in.
I:1773;478;I recommend this movie to anyone.
I:1773;479;One viewing of this film and one can see why it won so many Oscars.
I:1773;480;Paul Scofield is brilliant, the script is excellent, and the drama is unparalleled.
I:1773;481;This is a fine example of what Hollywood can do when it puts its mind to it.
I:1773;482;People of integrity are such a rarity in modern politics, one would almost bet the farm that no one in Washington would die for their beliefs.Yet this is exactly what More did.
I:1773;483;The highlight is Scofield eloquently portraying More's trial.
I:1773;484;It is absolutely worth a look or two.
I:1773;485;This inspirational story of Thomas More's martyrdom shows us how a man of principles is supposed to live.
I:1773;486;The actors are excellent and the language of the play is elevated and intelligent.
I:1773;487;It's a classic to own.
I:1773;488;The story's still powerful, the performances still splendid in spite of the passage of time since the film's first release.
I:1773;489;This is an historic drama with wit, intelligence and a refreshing lack of heavy handedness.
I:1773;490;"on another note it's great fun to see ""early editions"" of some of the cast."
I:1773;491;Great flick then, great flick now!
I:1773;492;Even as his actions affected the welfare of his family he held strong.
I:1773;493;in this day and time when anything goes and morality is decided by what someone wants, it is refreshing to view the true story of a man of principles as Thomas More was.
I:1773;494;I use it in my history class to show the students the internal struggle the English faced before they would defy the king.
I:1773;495;The WHY is more important than the WHAT!
I:1773;496;This movie was very good and had a compelling plot line.
I:1773;497;It's amazing that Sir Thomas More was willing to sacrifice everything, including his own life for his religious beliefs.
I:1773;498;When I first saw the movie in 1967, I was riveted by the clear, crystalline dialogue of Robert Bolt, uttered with passion and precision by Paul Scofield.
I:1773;499;The clarity of thought, the elevation of principals above self is awe.
I:1773;500;I highly recommend it as it applies even today.
I:1773;501;"An outstanding adaptation of Robert Bolt's play by ""High Noon"" director Fred Zinnemann, ""Seasons"" revisits the ill."
I:1773;502;Scofield, in his very first role, won an Oscar for his shaded portrayal of More, Shaw is magnificent playing a fiery young Henry, and cameos by Orson Welles, Susannah York, and Leo McKern round out a sterling cast.
I:1773;503;"office smash in 1966, ""Seasons"" will resonate with anyone who's ever had a crisis of conscience."
I:1773;504;A Man for All Seasons (1966)Starring: Paul Scofield, Wendy Hiller and Director: Fred Zinnemann is a great film about King Henry VIII wanting to get a divorce and marry Anne Boleyn.
I:1773;505;A true story of a great man with a courageous hart.
I:1773;506;This movie should be seen by all, young and old, who love liberty and freedom.
I:1773;507;It is a story for those who understand that freedom is the most expensive item mankind has ever invented.
I:1773;508;known production of Thomas More versus Henry VIII is a riveting account of personal belief set against the power of monarchy during England's turbulent separation from the Catholic Church.
I:1773;509;Orson Wells's brief appearance as Cardinal Wolesey is a brilliant portrayal.
I:1773;510;Scofield, similarly, in his depiction of the existential position of a 16th century Christian who risks his life .
I:1773;511;For me this movie ranks among other understated classics like Chariots of Fire and the King's Speech.
I:1773;512;In addition it presents a wealth of excellent theological ideas.
I:1773;513;Great historical story and very well acted.
I:1773;514;No wonder it won Academy Award.
I:1773;515;It is an incredible movie that brings the story of Thomas More the only man who dared to say no to Henry the VIII during the time of the English Reformation.
I:1773;516;No man dared to oppose him but Thomas More did and the movie explore the ways he did and how brilliant he was when interpreting the laws of the country.
I:1773;517;Definitely a must see movie for the present times when courage, moral and ethical values count for nothing when money is in between.
I:1773;518;I enjoyed this film I thought it would Glorify or excuse Henry who was besides an Immoral Man started an Religion just to suit himself(Anglican.
I:1773;519;(the English did have a Great Queen.
I:1773;520;Winner of the 1966 Academcy Award for Best Picture, A Man for All Seasons has all that .
I:1773;521;and denounced Rich, the solicitor.
I:1773;522;"*""I Die His Majesty's Good Servant, but God's First""This is a powerful, powerful film."
I:1773;523;The fact that it won 1966's Best Picture is truly amazing.
I:1773;524;Our family finds this film a classic.
I:1773;525;It gets you thinking, self.
I:1773;526;It is entertaining with the landscape and plot, as well as the clever wisdom of this great man.
I:1773;527;consider reading David Daniell's life of Tyndale, the courageous and brilliant scholar and translator of the Bible into English, for a fascinating picture of the greatness of one man whom More chose to hate.
I:1773;528;I highly recommend this film not only to fans of historical drama but for a truly well.
I:1773;529;"This 1966 winner for Best Picture is stellar in every respect
I:1773;530;Paul Scofield won the Oscar as Best Actor in his first major screen role.
I:1773;531;Paul preferred stage acting and while I can understand his preference I mourn the fact that this great actor can't be seen in more films.
I:1773;532;I don't know if that's the case but it has many historically correct touches.
I:1773;533;Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey uses genuine sheepskin parchment with a real quill pen as well as an exact duplicate of Wolsey's official seal.
I:1773;534;The ax used in the execution scene is authentic from the period.
I:1773;535;A Man for All Seasons won six Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture.
I:1773;536;It features an excellent period musical score by George Delerue and the backbone of any film, wonderful writing by Robert Bolt who also won an Oscar.
I:1773;537;Even the smaller roles are expertly played.
I:1773;538;look for a young John Hurt and the wonderful Leo McKern.
I:1773;539;The story of Sir Thomas More is taught in every high school and is well known.
I:1773;540;this edition has a special feature included on the life of Thomas More.
I:1773;541;Fred Zinneman's A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is one of the great heights of cinema.
I:1773;542;John Box, the Oscar winning designer and longtime associate of David Lean's, made magic with very little and Freddie Young offered up an example of why cinematography is surely an art in its self.
I:1773;543;an inspiring film that surely gives a memorable celebration of the human spirit.
I:1773;544;Without a doubt, this is one of my top ten films of all time, mainly because there is so much that can be drawn from.
I:1773;545;zinnemann's adaptaion of the Robert Boltman play was done on a low budget, and whilst it takes artistic license slightly further, the film remains a historical masterpiece.
I:1773;546;Robert Shaw as Henry is also fantastic, showing the viewer both the very personal side of the monarch, when he is disappointed at More's non.
I:1773;547;"attendence at the wedding to Anne Boleyn
I:1773;548;The swift change from an amiable friend to a dominating absolute monarch is brilliantly played by Shaw, and though it is a marked contrast to the plain More, the performances are equally great.
I:1773;549;Both positions indicate what a great man he was.
I:1773;550;A scholar of great learning, a man of letters, a liberal in an autocratic age.
I:1773;551;His character was perhaps best displayed as his end, in his words to the executioner .
I:1773;552;The combination of humor and greatness, even in the face of death, povide a role model for all.
I:1773;553;if you enjoy the film, read the play and 'The Life of Sir Thomas More' by William Roper, his nephew.
I:1773;554;Although it bears relation to a specific incident, this popular poem of the time is a fitting epitaph for this great man .
I:1773;555;if it's something you like, check out A Lion in Winter and Anne of a Thousand Days .
I:1773;556;This film was a wonderful example of everything that makes a movie great.
I:1773;557;I was a bit surprised to read that one individual was upset with the film because it wildly distorted the life of Sir Thomas More.
I:1773;558;Notwithstanding, this was a great film and should receive 5 stars.
I:1773;559;"It is in works like this that we understand the true meaning of humanities""."
I:1773;560;the essence of being human!This film is a psychodrama of ethics and integrity.
I:1773;561;oddly enough, the premise and the sympathetic portrayal of Moore makes this one of the last pro.
I:1773;562;there are excellent performances all around, and Oscar has duly honored this film.
I:1773;563;The filming locations are perfect, and the costumes magnificent.
I:1773;564;"There is also an excellent cameo by Orson ""Pinky and the Brain"" Welles, as Cardinal Woolsey."
I:1773;565;in my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made and it should rank right up there with Becket, Lion in Winter (the original with Kate Hepburn, Casablanca, and Citizen Kane.
I:1773;566;An excellent movie with, what has to be, one of the best cast of actors in a critically acclaimed success.
I:1773;567;This film not only provides the audience with great visual backgrounds, a solid script, off the chart actors, but also provides a message that one could only wish were true today.
I:1773;568;The script brings the mind to the exercise of thought it was created to have.
I:1773;569;All the actors turned in a classical performance.
I:1773;570;This is great film for the family of faith to watch together for a movie night.
I:1773;571;It was very entertainly and pretty well held to the historical facts.
I:1773;572;forward to see the rest of the movie.
I:1773;573;The fight for freedom of thinking and speech of this free man is very well rendered.
I:1773;574;One of the best movies I've seen.
I:1773;575;I was overwhelmed by the law and philosophic insights the pictures bring to us in this great movie.
I:1773;576;This is an excellent movie.
I:1773;577;The most important and obvious reason is to honor God.
I:1773;578;"Maybe there's something to these beliefs
I:1773;579;This wonderful movie helps ensure that the sacrifice of Saint Thomas More continues to also have this effect on people in the present day.
I:1773;580;My father really likes this movie and was so thrilled when I gave it to him!
I:1773;581;It was in perfect condition and arrived on time!
I:1773;582;Movie was very well done.
I:1773;583;Starts a little slow, but once the story line is established, it was quite enjoyable.
I:1773;584;"This movie could be watched ""fresh"" by an 18 year old today and I believe they would have the same delight and interest in the story and its message that I did back then."
I:1773;585;he has a marvellous ability to NOT RUSH, and as a result we hang onto his words, and get the full force of his acting.
I:1773;586;"I'm afraid the women were not directed well
I:1773;587;John Hurt, then a newcomer, gives an excellent creepy foretaste of the characters he went on to portray.
I:1773;588;This 1966 film won an Academy Award for Paul Scofield who played the role of Sir Thomas More.
I:1773;589;this is a grand theme and a grand story.
I:1773;590;The England of those days is recreated and the costumes are magnificent.
I:1773;591;all the actors, including Wendy Hiller, Robert Shaw, Orson Wells and John Hurt were excellent.
I:1773;592;The film is as timely today as it was then.
I:1773;593;This is an important theme.
I:1773;594;I do recommend the film however.
I:1773;595;It is certainly worth watching.
I:1773;596;"The full quote is actually, Duke of Norfolk: ""Come with us, Thomas, for fellowship!"""
I:1773;597;There is intrigue everywhere, as overreaching men seek to take advantage of the new world order to settle some old scores and climb over the graves if necessary of those they help to depose.
I:1773;598;paul Scofield does a wonderful job as Sir Thomas More, and one wonders why his career, at least in America, didn't take off: he's great and he won an Oscar to boot, yet he didn't become an Olivier, or what we would have today in Hopkins.
I:1773;599;She loves her husband, but is deeply resentful over his decision to go all the way with his moral stance.
I:1773;600;Our villains are excellent, notably Leo McKern as the crafty Cromwell, who starts as Secretary to Woolsey and works his way up to a position of supreme power, and John Hurt as the sycophantic Richard Rich, who More fatally befriended just before the movie's start.
I:1773;601;A Man for All Seasons is a fine film, and well deserving of its Oscars and fame.
I:1773;602;I can just add my highest recommendation for you to see this film if you have not already.
I:1773;603;This movie is a precious gem that you will want to look at again and again.
I:1773;604;an absolute must see movie and one you should own.
I:1773;605;The writing and language in this classic movie was beautifully illustrated.
I:1773;606;Sir Thomas is a man of strong convictions and faith.
I:1773;607;It takes courage, strength, and confidence not to go with the crowd, and in his time Risk It All.
I:1773;608;He's the stuff martyrs are made of.
I:1773;609;I share that so that you will not be surprised like I was.
I:1773;610;In my opinion, The Man For All Seasons was an excellent film as it accurately portrayed the life of Thomas More and relayed the issues regarding King Henry in a suspenseful manner.
I:1773;611;A Man For All Seasons is a film for the ages.
I:1773;612;I highly reccomend this film for both educational and entertaining purposes.
I:1773;613;I am surprised that it's rated R .
I:1773;614;I watched this with my kids and it's very appropriate for them (ages 5, 8, 9).
I:1773;615;I had to explain what was going on a times throughout the movie but it was very good!
I:1773;616;This movie deserved every single Academy Award it ever won.
I:1773;617;one of the most significant phrases that More makes, before his beheading: I die his majesty's good subject, but God's first.
I:1773;618;This movie not only gives the viewer true insight into what actually happened regarding Henry VIII's Anne Boleyn fiasco, but it also will stand ageless as an incredible work of film.
I:1773;619;I can recommend this vendor.
I:1773;620;Standing up for your faith and loving God above all things is a Good thing.
I:1773;621;This is one of the great movies!
I:1773;622;Paul Scofield is totally brilliant in his role as Sir Thomas Moore.
I:1773;623;Richard Harris is also outstanding.
I:1773;624;This film has so much going for it.
I:1773;625;This movie won some Oscars and should have won a whole bunch more.
I:1773;626;This is a very well achieved movie that addresses the philosophical and politic conflict between the subsequent Anglican protestants and Catholics in Britain during the times of Henry VIII.
I:1773;627;A very entertaining lesson of history for those of us who were not very familiar with these events.
I:1773;628;By far, acting and characterization of Thomas More by Paul Scofield is just superb.
I:1773;629;Also interesting to see John Hurt (Orwell 1984) in the role of Richard Rich.
I:1773;630;This is one of the movies I wanted for my collection since many years ago.
I:1773;631;it is wonderful to find something I want or like at Amazon!
I:1773;632;A Man for All Seasons is a superb film.
I:1773;633;This 1966 film is very well acted, the dialogue is incredible and it is based on real historical events.
I:1773;634;It won 6 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Writing.
I:1773;635;Despite Charlton Heston being a terrific actor in the 1988 version, Paul Scofield really nails it here.
I:1773;636;He portrays Sir Thomas More splendidly as we see his battles with his conscience, his king and his country.
I:1773;637;Robert Shaw is terrific as Henry VIII while Orson Welles is solid as Cardinal Woolsey.
I:1773;638;In addition, King Henry VIII must be one of the most fascinating kings to have ever lived.
I:1773;639;He truly changed history in many ways and the repercussions can still be felt to this day.
I:1773;640;"My only complaint is that the extras are fairly light (there is a documentary ""The Life of Sir Thomas More"" and a trailer)."
I:1773;641;The Man for all Seasons is a great film with Paul Schofield excelling himself.
I:1773;642;Paul Scofield gives a stellar performance as a man whose ethics and principles trump even his regard for his life.
I:1773;643;Wendy Hiller, a brilliant stage actress is superb as Sir Thomas' wife, and it would be difficult to find a more convincing King Henry than Robert Shaw.
I:1773;644;For the collector, this movie is a must
I:1773;645;As depicted here, he is an odd mix of hero and stooge, wise man and pedant.
I:1773;646;That artful mix is the strength of this story of the life of a remarkably intelligent and, in his own, bent way, couragious man.
I:1773;647;Henry, mad, passionate, and lecherous by turn, enters the story as a man without an heir, and interested in dumping his queen for a woman who can produce the next king.
I:1773;648;putting everything he knows and loves at risk.
I:1773;649;one with the story as much as the film.
I:1773;650;this movie has some beautiful cinematography, and some nice acting turns, including by Scofield, who won an Oscar for portraying More.
I:1773;651;In this regard, it is an especially timely commentary on a church which seems to have changed very little in 500 years.
I:1773;652;The King stands for something and must be moral.
I:1773;653;He wants to appear pure before God when his time comes.
I:1773;654;the intelligence and goodness, the pearls of wisdom that come from this man leave you in awe.
I:1773;655;wards everyone was thinking what a wonderful, marvelous man he was.
I:1773;656;This great movie is the only movie every made about the life of St. Thomas More.
I:1773;657;Watching this movie enabled me to get to know this great man who defended the faith with courage and zeal until he was martyred for the faith.
I:1773;658;This is, without a doubt, my favorite film of all time, and I never tire of seeing it.
I:1773;659;Scofield's performance is miraculous, and makes you feel a profound need to connect with your own capacity for behavior marked by integrity.
I:1773;660;Scofield is magnificent, as is the rest of the cast.
I:1773;661;I recommend this to anyone desperate for a thoughtful and unabashedly religious film.
I:1773;662;The dialog is brilliant, as were the positions taken by Sir Thomas More.
I:1773;663;even though I don't share all of his beliefs his life was so profound, so composed, and possessed of so much integrity.
I:1773;664;if you appreciate drama that is intelligent and articulate you will enjoy this film.
I:1773;665;If it were fiction it would still be enjoyable, but the fact that it depicts real events makes it especially poignant.
I:1773;666;Inasmuch as the filmmaking itself goes, it is a well.
I:1773;667;shot, wonderfully acted film, deserving the accolades heaped upon it.
I:1773;668;In other words is a principle right only when it suits one.
I:1773;669;Just as inspiring as the first timeI saw it.
I:1773;670;Hard to find this kind of commitment to one's conscience today
I:1773;671;rOPER: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law!MORE: Yes!
I:1773;672;Cromwell enthralls young Rich, telling him that if the King wants to divorce his woman and marry another, it is up to the administrators to make it happen.
I:1773;673;Slowly, inevitably, Cromwell seduces Rich to betray Sir Thomas More, from whom Rich once received a gift.
I:1773;674;"rich is played by a young, handsome John Hurt
I:1773;675;scofield, as More, brings admirable restraint to More's uncompromising loyalty to his principles of faith.
I:1773;676;The contrast to today's champions of people of faith is most instructive.
I:1773;677;It is about Rich, who More knows is about to betray him that More has the following dialogue with Roper.
I:1773;678;Even though this morning is really old it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:1773;679;Great plot based on the true life story of Saint Thomas!!
I:1773;680;The character development was great and the message it portrayed.
I:1773;681;Kept me interested to see how everything developed!
I:1773;682;I am so happy that Thomas More stood by his principals and did not betray his belief's.
I:1773;683;There is a reason that this movie is one that most presidents love to watch.
I:1773;684;This tells the story eloquently .
I:1773;685;Try this movie for sure.
I:1773;686;An age when big government didn't serve but ruled and certainly new best.
I:1773;687;I thought this was a great movie.
I:1773;688;A Man For All Seasons is a marvelous period film driven by Robert Bolt's trenchant script and superb acting by Paul Scofield playing Sir Thomas Moore who must by conscience oppose the desires of King Henry the VIII (played by Robert Shaw).
I:1773;689;You'll want to see the film repeatedly to savor its intelliegence, crisp direction by Fred Zinneman, and authentic looking sets and costumes.
I:1773;690;A Man For All Seasons richly deserved the 6 Oscars it captured including best film of 1966.
I:1773;691;An award winning play, a script done by the playwright himself, an incredible cast, and exceptional photography combine to create one of the greatest of the 1960s historical dramas.
I:1773;692;The story of Henry VIII and Sir Thomas More provides the backdrop eto what is a tour.
I:1773;693;Paul Scofield, one of the greatest of all British actors, shines in his portrayal of the man who was driven by faith to give up everything.
I:1773;694;Robert Shaw Delivers the best portrayal of Henry VIII ever seen on the screen.
I:1773;695;Even the minor characters shine, like a very young Vanessa Redgrave in an early non.
I:1773;696;This is the kind of movie that reminds me what great filmmaking can be.
I:1773;697;There is also a 5.1 soundtrack, so the film sounds better than ever before.
I:1773;698;Great movie, for traditional Catholics.
I:1773;699;This is movie making, the classic way.
I:1773;700;Where the story, script, (an Oscar Winner), acting, led by Paul Winfield, (best actor Oscar Winner), with great direction by Fred Zimmerman come together.
I:1773;701;this is a grand movie!!
I:1773;702;Recently I discovered that one of the most notable historical dramas of the 1960s had somehow managed to escape my eye for over thirty years.
I:1773;703;A highly honored film (winner of six Academy Awards in 1966, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor) with a wonderfully talented cast, a fantastic screenplay, and a fascinating historical figure as its subject.
I:1773;704;And yet a film I had never seen .
I:1773;705;A wonderfully acted, historically accurate, and moving account of the life of one of the great men in English history: Sir Thomas More, English lawyer, scholar, statesman' and a victim of the wrath of King Henry VIII.
I:1773;706;A Man For All Seasons is Robert Bolt's beautiful screen adaptation of his own highly successful and award winning stage play of the same name.
I:1773;707;It's a reasonably accurate accounting of the events of the last years of Sir Thomas More's life.
I:1773;708;Watch the film to see with what great dignity and honor Sir Thomas More confronts his accusers and, ultimately, death itself.
I:1773;709;A Man For All Seasons is one of the finest historical dramas I've ever seen.
I:1773;710;The acting is simply superb throughout.
I:1773;711;Robert Shaw brings a slim, youthful, and uncouth vigor to the part of Henry VIII.
I:1773;712;winning screenplay fairly crackles throughout the movie's two hour running time.
I:1773;713;Although there's precious little action, the dialogue is brisk and commands the viewer's attention.
I:1773;714;It's beautifully eloquent as well.
I:1773;715;A Man For All Seasons is a historical drama with a deeper message: how do we human beings reconcile our core values and principles with outward pressures to conform to society's rules?
I:1773;716;In Sir Thomas More's case, we find a deeply religious man confronted with the greatest dilemma of his life.
I:1773;717;His faith in God, always unshakable, took primacy over the demands of his King.
I:1773;718;frequently become the source of our greatest trials.
I:1773;719;"He was deprived of his wealth
I:1773;720;It is a superb historical presentation.
I:1773;721;I hope the film industry will give us more of this calibre.
I:1773;722;The acting is supurb in this rendition of the story of Sir Thomas More.
I:1773;723;He expects to be opposed by the Bishops, but they are bought off with the grand sum of 100,000 Pounds.
I:1773;724;Thomas More is sly in his virtue, he understands that speaking out would be treason.
I:1773;725;He leaves such a strong impression that his bizzare moodiness is present even when he's off screen.
I:1773;726;Fred Zinnemann(who has recieved 9 Oscar nominations from 22 feature films) directs with his usual unfussy camera work.
I:1773;727;While this technique has dated his thriller The Day of The Jackal, its helps this film immeasurably.
I:1773;728;It allows us to stand back and savor the incredible sets, the glistening costumes and most of all Robert Bolt's incredibly literate dialogue.
I:1773;729;The first time I watched Man For All Seasons was yesterday and I watched it again that very day just to unravel the beautiful dialogue.
I:1773;730;Through out the film he will remain eloquent.
I:1773;731;That is why when he breaks down, it is so incredibly moving.
I:1773;732;He is a man of the world who understands how hazy morality can be.
I:1773;733;A Man For All Seasons is a great film.
I:1773;734;This speaks volumes about the concentration of too much power being wielded by one person.
I:1773;735;Wonderful performances by all the actors
I:1773;736;I've yet to see a more perfect film.
I:1773;737;Aside from the reasons it won all those Oscars (best screenplay, cinematography, etc), the journey Sir Thomas More undergoes is so compelling, so emotional, without seeming to be, that I find myself watching this film at regular intervals in my life.
I:1773;738;It is a a very encouraging movie and a good reminder that we shouldn't value this world and the thing of this world more than our great God.
I:1773;739;and a story worth knowing and understanding.
I:1773;740;The performers are incredibly fine in this magnificent filmPaul Scofield is without doubt the greatest actor of his time.
I:1773;741;Excellent special edition of this film.
I:1773;742;Amazon always has the best film editions available, that are difficult to fine elsewhere.
I:1773;743;A classic movie with a wonderful script and beautiful visuals.
I:1773;744;The acting is superb and the history is accurately portrayed.
I:1773;745;surely one of the greatest screenwriters of the 20th century.
I:1773;746;the film is subtly directed and leaves plenty of room for its actors to deliver jaw.
I:1773;747;dropping performances with Bolt's tremendous script.
I:1773;748;Of particular note is Orson Wells's brief and excellent portrayal of Woolsey.
I:1773;749;This is a powerful closet drama, full of finely wrought performances.
I:1773;750;Leo McKern is brilliant as the self.
I:1773;751;a truly inspiring tour de force that is brilliant, spellbinding and ever worthy of the Best Actor Statuette.
I:1773;752;Colors are rich, bold and vibrant.
I:1773;753;Flesh tones are quite naturally rendered.
I:1773;754;Overall the image is quite solid.
I:1773;755;The audio is mono but well presented .
I:1773;756;bOTTOM LINE: A great movie in a good.
I:1773;757;This film portrays the sixteenth century life and death of Sir Thomas More, a prominent member of the court of English king Henry VIII.
I:1773;758;Grounded in historical fact, this movie vividly tells the story of More's stand against the king's betrayal of the law of God .
I:1773;759;overall I thought this movie was very well done, with top notch acting and a well developed narrative.
I:1773;760;The message is unmistakable .
I:1773;761;that in an age of moral and ethical relativism, sometimes one must gamble all, even one's life, to cling to integrity .
I:1773;762;and ultimately one's own soul.
I:1773;763;the characters are true to many people we might relate in today's world.
I:1773;764;the seperation of church and state, something we learn here in 10th or 11th grade.
I:1773;765;Imagine, a man of integrity and honor, and a churchman at that.
I:1773;766;Sir Thomas is Mike Huckaby with brains, guts, and decency.
I:1773;767;the paul scofield version of 'a man for all seasons' is one of the best movies ever made.
I:1773;768;the script is brilliant and the acting is flawless.
I:1773;769;This is a great movie of faith and devotion to truth.
I:1773;770;The movie came in perfect shape.
I:1773;771;"This edition of ""A Man for All Seasons"" is the best I have ever seen in years."
I:1773;772;the picture is vivid as if it had been filmed yesterday.
I:1773;773;Colors are bright and well.
I:1773;774;fledged Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Stereo sound and this is spectacular, given that the short music passages, as well as the Main and End Titles composed by Georges Delerue, truly come to new life and become very imposing and plastic to the ear.
I:1773;775;the cast is simply majestic.
I:1773;776;paul Scofield as Thomas More is unforgettable and to this day, this is his role.
I:1773;777;wendy Hiller, as his wife, moves us to tears and laughter in her brief moments.
I:1773;778;"john Colicos, as Cromwell, is as devious and lethal as the methods he uses to ""convince"" people to talk."
I:1773;779;john Hurt, in one of his first roles, as Richard Rich, plays an upstart beautifully.
I:1773;780;susannah York, as one of Thomas More's daughters, shines in all her youth and freshness, as well as brightness.
I:1773;781;and finally, the best for last, the great Robert Shaw, as a memorable King Henry VIII, the subject of the entire movie, but who only appears in just a few scenes.
I:1773;782;in this movie, you get a sample of living legends acting just for you, in one of the best written modern period epics ever.
I:1773;783;highly recommended for the entire family.
I:1773;784;It is a guaranteed experience.
I:1773;785;If you are not already familiar with the story of St. Thomas More, please watch this movie.
I:1773;786;This movie I could watch over and over again, it has some lines that are priceless.
I:1773;787;St Thomas More is a man you can really admire for his courage and virtue facing all his enemies.
I:1773;788;This is a true story good to know this what really happened why Henry VIII fall from his faith and all England suffered to this day because of this.
I:1773;789;But because this is one of my favorite films, I want to try to relate something about what makes this film so special to me.
I:1773;790;There is an artistic beauty of expression within the filming, that's certainly a big part of it.
I:1773;791;The dialogue is beautiful, yet simple.
I:1773;792;The story is simple, yet powerful, and this also describes the performances.
I:1773;793;There is intense feeling and division, but never a sense of condemnation.
I:1773;794;This film somehow does for me, what great works of art have done for so many, for so long.
I:1773;795;This film draws me into itself and fills me with a sense of beauty,.
I:1773;796;But the story of Thomas More, at least as portrayed here in Robert Bolt's Oscar.
I:1773;797;winning screenplay, is the story of a true martyr: Someone who is willing sacrifice everything he holds dear, including his life .
I:1773;798;Fred Zinnemann's direction is incredibly skilled.
I:1773;799;Under it, Paul Scofield won Best Actor for portraying this historical figure with great dignity and a surprising amount of wit.
I:1773;800;violently heroic in defense of his religious conviction.
I:1773;801;The movie won four other Oscars, including one for cinematographer Ted Moore's sumptuous English landscapes and another, richly deserved, for Zinnemann.
I:1773;802;Truly an amazing film .
I:1773;803;It's the stuff of legends yet it is completely human and real.
I:1773;804;All is passing in this world and he knew that well, so he put his hope in a Higher Source.
I:1773;805;the acting is superb and it chokes me up everytime!
I:1773;806;The language/dialog is heartfelt yet surprisingly humorous at times.
I:1773;807;A man for all Seasons is a thoughtful movie backed with cast of great acting.
I:1773;808;Camera angles and lighting contribute in making him appear as reptilian and dangerous.
I:1773;809;perhaps the weakest performance is that of Robert Shaw as King Henry VIII.
I:1773;810;educated and clever daughter, Margret.
I:1773;811;The movie pivots around this portrayal and Scofield delivers.
I:1773;812;You see the ending before you see the movie.
I:1773;813;This brings us to the most deliberate weakness of the movie.
I:1773;814;If you listen carefully to the features added to the movie, you will have an idea.
I:1773;815;Every return to Moore's estate is a return to the light.
I:1773;816;Cromwell, Wolsey, the Knighted Sir Richard Rich are creatures of the dark.
I:1773;817;this is a 5 star performance.
I:1773;818;I say performance rather than movie because it is the acting, along with costuming and sets and camera work that make this a 5 star thinking person's movie.
I:1773;819;A Man For All Seasons was a very successful Broadway play.
I:1773;820;The movie is a morality play and we are drawn into the pain that both Thomas Henry feel.
I:1773;821;Wendy Hiller portrays Sir Thomas' wife with compassion and understanding of a man who is willing give his life for his beliefs.
I:1773;822;Mr. Scofield won the Best Actor Oscar and the film took the Best Picture prize.
I:1773;823;A Man For All Seasons is an intelligent, thoughtful and well made film.
I:1773;824;I don't think I've seen that for any other film!The story is true, it is important, it is as relevant to today as it was when it unfolded.
I:1773;825;It is beautiful, powerfully portrayed, without cinematic excesses that would detract us from the tale.
I:1773;826;People mentioned the score and I have no memory of hearing music, which I take as a good thing.
I:1773;827;the cast is first rate.
I:1773;828;English actors are sooo good.
I:1773;829;The young beautiful Susanna York comes up with such deep chest tones at times when she is being really serious.
I:1773;830;very impressive for such a small person.
I:1773;831;Robert Shaw gave a terrific performance as Henry VIII, here seen as the bon vivant, the man who loves music, composes it himself, extolls on the beauty of the summer night and the white lilac bush and of course, loves the ladies.
I:1773;832;His affection and admiration for More seem genuine.
I:1773;833;He gives us lots of hearty laughter, which is erie when we consider the actions he took later in the story.
I:1773;834;He does the job just right, expressing perfectly the callowness of such a type.
I:1773;835;He makes your flesh creep when you see him in his fancy dress, lying, in the final courtroom scene.
I:1773;836;best of all was Paul Scofield in the performance of a lifetime.
I:1773;837;I'm so glad he got the Oscar!
I:1773;838;As a film, this is indeed superb!
I:1773;839;I found the film to be a little slow at the beginning but the writing and acting are top.
I:1773;840;If you are a Henry VIII enthusiast or historian,this film is definitely for you even though it focuses more on Sir Thomas Moore.
I:1773;841;I have watched this movie on VHS at least six times, and I always come away from it in awe of Thomas.
I:1773;842;It is a unique presentation which I need to see annually.
I:1773;843;A Man for all Seasons is the best film I have ever seen.
I:1773;844;The movie of the life of St. Thomas More is both realistic and moving.
I:1773;845;He eventually does receive that strength, but not before winning his wife and her blessings over.
I:1773;846;the movie, even without its rich intellectual dialogue, can serve as a reminder of what the average person can achieve if they maintain their integrity.
I:1773;847;A great movie with exceptional dialogue should be enjoyed in another language.
I:1773;848;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:1773;849;piece of entertainment, it is utterly magnificent.
I:1773;850;the script is amazing, with many wonderful bits.
I:1773;851;The cinematography, costuming and direction are gorgeous.
I:1773;852;While the extras are lighter than in many films, the documenary on More is very interesting, and there are 3 subtitle options (English, French and Portuguese), and 3 audio options (2 English, one very well done French track.)
I:1773;853;Many good films have weak dialogue, but it is the dialogue and carefully set up plot that takes this film to a higher level.
I:1773;854;There is no fluff, every scene is carefully laid out and illuminated with eloquent dialogue.
I:1773;855;It brings the period alive, and ALL the acting is first rate.
I:1773;856;The cinematography is goregious to look at.
I:1773;857;This film has it ALL.
I:1773;858;First Class entertainment, all the way!
I:1773;859;A Man For All Seasons is full of thespian genius.
I:1773;860;The play by Robert Bolt is beautifully adapted in this marvelous film.
I:1773;861;Paul Scofield's performance is unmatched.
I:1773;862;King Henry is very human.
I:1773;863;Paul Scofield played Sir Thomas More exceptionally well in this movie, recreating his award.
I:1773;864;winning role from the theatre.
I:1773;865;It is well shot, well directed, well casted, well scripted.
I:1773;866;Back in the 1960's, the Academy Awards were still somewhat legitimate, willing to consider real movies, real acting, real direction, and real subject matter.
I:1773;867;It reveals the true character of an honest, decent, truly Good man up against growing leachery, tyranny, intrigue, and corruption in high places.
I:1773;868;So many today like to think that Henry VIII was a great reformer, a great liberator, a great innovator, and such.
I:1773;869;True history buffs should appreciate this for what it really is.
I:1773;870;The best movies are not fiction, they are true history.
I:1773;871;ho about Sir Thomas More's duty, integrity, etc.
I:1773;872;the acting is incomparable, a perfect ensemble centering around the unflinchingly confident performance of Scofield (he'd done the role hundreds of times on stage).
I:1773;873;The costumes won an Oscar, and were certainly beautiful, though they were so bulky it looked really difficult for the characters to get close to each other.
I:1773;874;It won an Oscar for Cinematography, too, though the film really is somewhat of a filmed play (I thought the filming of Hawaii and The Sand Pebbles ,also nominated, was more breath.
I:1773;875;Though these are minor problems, they are soon forgotten when one pays attention to the incredible screenplay of Robert Bolt.
I:1773;876;loaded with passion and strong character development, it's also a valid history lesson.
I:1773;877;priced than most others, since there are absolutely NO extras of any kind.
I:1773;878;This film is notable also for Vanessa Redgrave's unbilled film debut as Anne Boleyn, on screen for only a few minutes, but an absolutely riveting film moment.
I:1773;879;This movie is the best of English historical movies.
I:1773;880;The camera work particularly makes you feel you are a participant in the events taking place.
I:1773;881;Not to mention the incredible performances of all the actors.
I:1773;882;This is the true story of the honorable Thomas More, lawyer, Chancellor of England and Saint who defended the Catholic faith in the face of the immoral king henry VIII.
I:1773;883;The cast is excellent, the acting is superb and the score is uplifting.
I:1773;884;this is a movie about courage and honor.
I:1773;885;A movie about a true hero.
I:1773;886;A movie for the whole family.
I:1773;887;A great lesson for all.
I:1773;888;For an older movie, this one is really great and worth watching many times.
I:1773;889;It is a very powerful historical story and I would strongly urge you to get a copy of it and watch it often.
I:1773;890;When the King of England was loyal to the Papacy Sir Thomas More enjoyed the King's favor [and the movie does not point out, persecuted Protestants].
I:1773;891;Simply put, this is quite possibly the finest film ever produced.
I:1773;892;Upon every level on which films are judged, this work of genius scores the highest attainable marks.
I:1773;893;It is a joy to watch, it is a joy to listen to, and it is a joy to reflect upon long after it is over.
I:1773;894;the dialogue is so brilliantly crafted, it often leaves you physically gasping.
I:1773;895;The performances are so astonishing, you completely forget that you have seen most of the performers many other times, because it is impossible to disassociate them from these characters and this time period.
I:1773;896;The cinematography, the set design, the score, the lighting, the costume design, all are absolutely extraordinary.
I:1773;897;A fine movie about a unique individual.
I:1773;898;A true and compelling story.
I:1773;899;Perfectly acted by pros of yesteryear.
I:1773;900;Paul Scofield is certainly an actor's actor.
I:1773;901;Absolutely superb acting from the entire cast led by Paul Scofield as Sir Thomas More, complimented by a wonderfully written screenplay results in what is one of the most intelligent and gripping historical films ever made.
I:1773;902;This one is in the top 10 of all time.
I:1773;903;Every detail is perfectly suited to the story without a wasted scene.
I:1773;904;It's been a long time since anyone has produced a movie that captures an historical event and time as well as this one does.
I:1773;905;winning performance as the beleagered More.
I:1773;906;acted and a good representation of the climate of the times.
I:1773;907;Considering this film will inevitable be compared with its illustrious predecessor of the same name, starring the great Paul Scofield as Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt's distinguished film and stage triumph, I am very pleased to report that Charlton Heston gives a performance of considerable merit.
I:1773;908;we become quite persuaded that Heston had the stuff necessary to bring power and excitement to great roles on the stage.
I:1773;909;Not surprisingly, he commands the stage in every scene in which he appears, and not due to physical size alone.
I:1773;910;heston rises to the loftiest moments in the play and makes us feel with vivid pain the injustice committed against one of the greatest men in England.
I:1773;911;This is one of my top ten favorite movies.
I:1773;912;Paul Scofield gives an epic performance.
I:1773;913;One of the best films of all time with one of the greatest performances of all time.
I:1773;914;A costume epic about a person (Sir Thomas More) who is both larger than life and at the same time a real person with whom you can identify.
I:1773;915;What is best about the film is the portrayal of More as a very reluctant martyr .
I:1773;916;Paul Scofield in the title role gives an understated but magnificent performance.
I:1773;917;The supporting roles by Wendy Hiller, etc., are uniformly excellent as is Fred Zinnemann's meticulous direction, but the film achieves greatness because of Scofield's performance.
I:1773;918;He is truly an actor for all seasons in a role for all seasons.
I:1773;919;This period in English history and then the Elizabethan era which follows have always interested me.
I:1773;920;life figure of Henry VIII, powerful and capricious yet always an enigma.
I:1773;921;People still disagree about Robert Bolt's characterization of More in the play and then in the film for which Bolt received an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay.
I:1773;922;He had an estate to protect and family obligations to accommodate.
I:1773;923;Paul Scofield received and deserved his Academy Award for best actor in a leading role.
I:1773;924;The film and director Fred Zimmermann also received Academy Awards.
I:1773;925;Moore also received an Academy Award for his work.
I:1773;926;A Man for All Seasons is my favorite film after Its a Wonderful Life.
I:1773;927;But it is a very close race.
I:1773;928;Paul Scofield as Sir Thomas More creates an indelible impression on you and makes you want to be a better person.
I:1773;929;He is, as another reviewer put it, a man of quiet dignity and conviction.
I:1773;930;He was an intellectual and a religious man.
I:1773;931;All to rare combination in his time and ours.
I:1773;932;It was actually this that cost him his life.
I:1773;933;More was a religious man to be sure and many religious people find strength in this film.
I:1773;934;But the way he comports himself and handles each encounter with grace and subtlety you just wish you could have such a nimble wit and strength of character.
I:1773;935;He represents something heroic people want to embody.
I:1773;936;This abstract case is what makes the movie timeless, and one whose message will continue to resonate even another fifty years from now.
I:1773;937;Paul Scofield turns in one of the great male acting performances of all time.
I:1773;938;Scofield brings Thomas More to life in a way its hard for me to take in that he is playing a role.
I:1773;939;Scofield has created an iconic vision of More that will persist regardless of the realities of the flesh and blood man.
I:1773;940;But garnered Best Picture,Director, Actor and both actor and actress supporting roles.
I:1773;941;It also won Best Cinematography, costume design and writing awards.
I:1773;942;If you have missed this film you have one of the truly great movies to still look forward to enjoying.
I:1773;943;Grand old movie, well acted, will watch many times again
I:1773;944;A wonderful movie, very realistic if not completely historically accurate.
I:1773;945;He was a marvelous actor, better than Olivier, with a gorgeous voice and excellent diction.
I:1773;946;era, but that is easily overlooked and most of all because of a great story and superb acting.
I:1773;947;With all the junk movies out on the store shelves, I am always relieved and happy to see a classic film re.
I:1773;948;This is a superb film by any standard!
I:1773;949;This was a great copy of the classic movie.
I:1773;950;It helped me review for my midterm and was enjoyable to wacth.
I:1773;951;This is a consummate version Bolt's stage drama which still holds its edge after all these years.
I:1773;952;Still thrilling on every level.
I:1773;953;Led by the late, great Paul Scofield, the cast is superb in interpreting Bolt's script.
I:1773;954;a beautiful and moving film on every level.
I:1773;955;Having read the Mantel books, it was interesting to see the contrasting views.
I:1773;956;Paul Scofield is so brilliant in his portrayal of this most admired man, it is stunning.
I:1773;957;"His words ""I die the King's good servant, but God's first"" is perfect, as are his morals and reasoning for his stand and his belief to die for what he believes in, above all other earthly considerations, including his family."
I:1773;958;Sir Thomas More really was exceptional in his day, and in any day, and unusual in the depth and absolute certainty in his convictions.
I:1773;959;"Robert Shaw makes a perfect Henry VIII, and there is a wonderful scene of Henry arriving in his Royal barge, to the estate of More, and jumping from the boat into the muddy water and laughing uproariously and with great delight
I:1773;960;The anguish on Scofield's face when he saw his family, in the Tower, for the last time, is unforgettable, and the pain and anger from Wendy Hiller, as his wife, is heartfelt.
I:1773;961;Scofield's face and emotions are so plain and honest and true throughout the entire production, is a tribute to Sir Thomas More, and represents what the real man must have endured and the nobility of his beliefs.
I:1773;962;there is a portrait of More, and if you see it, you can see this man was truly exceptional, for his or any other time.you can see it in his face.
I:1773;963;Bolt's play is wonderfully brought to life by a stellar cast.
I:1773;964;The word selections are effective and eloquent, displaying the elusive edges of emotions and the raw nature of desire.
I:1773;965;Despite anyone's religious convictions, the sheer power of the spoken word expelled from the depths of Sir Thomas, the gentle servant of the King as portrayed by Paul Scofield, is definately worth the watch.
I:1773;966;The opening scenes of the movie are visually enticing.
I:1773;967;the scripts and acting were really great and the dilemma ofThomas More's allegiance to the church versus the king wasthe central struggle of the film and the story telling and actingblended well together to reflect More's faith in the church's authorityover the king's.
I:1773;968;It's a great movie that is worth watching again.
I:1773;969;This is one of the greatest historical films ever made.
I:1773;970;classic themes of choice between good and evil, morality, and unyielding conscience upheld against force and psychological pressure.
I:1773;971;It is a very important film, especially these days, but also so well constructed, it overwhelms you.
I:1773;972;aesthetivally wonderful, perfect as a Beethoven Sonata or his 9th.
I:1773;973;Paul Scofield was Sir Thomas More, a powerful example of what a man who exhibited His Love for God and his fellow man looks like by demonstrating what it means to embody the teachings of Jesus Christ.
I:1773;974;"Scofield's presentation of a man watching his traditional world dissolve, replaced by an emerging political one is more than compelling
I:1773;975;Cardinal Wolsey's death, in a superb cameo by Orson Welles, establishes how much power the church wielded in the state.
I:1773;976;Henry's break with Rome flew in the face of a millennium of European tradition.
I:1773;977;Bolt tries to make Henry More's foil, but Leo McKern's stunning performance as Thomas Cromwell walks away with the job.
I:1773;978;McKern vividly portrays a man of the new age, seeking power not for himself, but for the State.
I:1773;979;Without detracting from either Scofield or Shaw, it's McKern who captures attention with his demonstration of a man of the 'new age' [for contrast, see him in the Beatles 'Help!']
I:1773;980;this film is a timeless classic.
I:1773;981;Both Henrys had laymen as their most powerful Chancellor.
I:1773;982;After I cleaned it ,it was great to sit and watch.
I:1773;983;A timeless classic in which a little history and a little drama come together in a clean yet realistic way.
I:1773;984;I find the English settings, the smart vocabulary and the representation of the Old English manner was preserved and delightful.
I:1773;985;Great show, it's no wonder it won a best reward.
I:1773;986;In the modern day, powerful men frequently divorce their wives with minimal repercussions on society as a whole.
I:1773;987;"Fred Zinnemann's ""A Man for All Seasons"" chronicles this event and captures all the moral and practical dueling that took place in the wake of one monarch's desire to move onto a new wife."
I:1773;988;His stubbornness to stick to his morals eventually leads to his imprisonment and eventual execution.
I:1773;989;Yet it still remains an inspiring story that reminds us of how noble the human spirit can be when it does not buckle under the pressures of morally.
I:1773;990;The performances in the film from top to bottom are outstanding.
I:1773;991;Scofield richly deserved his Best Actor Oscar and Shaw shines in his role as Henry.
I:1773;992;One of my favorite movies ever!
I:1773;993;If you are looking for the cinematography of today, you won't find it here, it's more like a play that has been filmed, but the brilliance of the interplay between characters is riveting enough to watch again and again.
I:1773;994;It is a particularly good film to discuss courage and the moral fortitude to do what one believes is right in the face of tremendous opposition.
I:1773;995;One of the great Tudor stories that doesn't center on the romance between Anne and Henry.
I:1773;996;"Superb acting, wonderful setting
I:1773;997;This film although a period piece transcends time and points us to our present political and moral decisions we face around the world.
I:1773;998;It is a gripping tale of excellent virtue and Western ethics.
I:1773;999;One of the best Movies there is.
I:1773;1000;the performances are Oscar worthy, and Robert Bolt's collaboration on the film ensures that the film stays true to the intent of the play he wrote.
I:1773;1001;i use this film in my High School English course, both as an example of literature on screen, and to help students understand the political culture of the 16th century.
I:1773;1002;Highly recommended 1966 masterpiece for Scofield's brilliant portrayal of Sir Thomas More.
I:1773;1003;Zinnemann's masterpiece covers how More stood up to the monarchy and against it during the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.
I:1773;1004;the film also drives home the importance of what an oath means to a believer and how important morals are to kings and subjects alike.
I:1773;1005;I have been a 'fan' of Sir Thomas More since high school, and this film is a big reason why.
I:1773;1006;Much has already been written about the fabulous cast, well.
I:1773;1007;written dialog, and beautiful filming.
I:1773;1008;The story itself is heart.
I:1773;1009;seeker (that rat, Richard Rich).
I:1773;1010;my favorite line comes when Henry VIII tries to get More to 'go along' by taking the oath.
I:1773;1011;and the heart of the issue.
I:1773;1012;paul Scofield is marvelous as Thomas More, Robert Shaw charismatic as Henry VIII, Wendy Hiller solid as Lady More, Susannah York refined and pious as More's favorite child, Margaret, and John Hurt suitably creepy as Richard Rich.
I:1773;1013;Though about events in the 16th century, it has modern.
I:1773;1014;A Man for All Seasons is superb story telling.
I:1773;1015;Excellent performances and a script that is neither condescending or 'playing to the lowest common denominator' brings over the horror of the politics of Henry's court.
I:1773;1016;paul Schofield is simply stunning and it is a film that rewards on countless viewings.
I:1773;1017;A fantastic movie exploring ethics, integrity, and friendship.
I:1773;1018;The acting is superb and the drama is gripping.
I:1773;1019;One of the best movies I've seen.
I:1773;1020;It's a great film and all that but the minor roles really make it for me.
I:1773;1021;While the movie is well acted,the characters are well portrayed!
I:1773;1022;One of the finest films of all time, directed by Fred ( High Noon, From Here to Eternity ) Zinnemann.
I:1773;1023;"Truly a cast for all seasons!It's an acting lesson, headed by the great Paul Scofield who not only captures the essence of Sir Thomas Moore, but who does so with superb economy of motion
I:1773;1024;Duse would have loved it.
I:1773;1025;the film won 6 Academy Awards, and it is well worth viewing today.
I:1773;1026;Thomas More is depicted as a man of integrity, good.
I:1773;1027;The serious nature of the film is balanced with scenes of humor.
I:1773;1028;This is one of my top 5 favorite movies.
I:1773;1029;Paul Scofield is great as St. Thomas, and the final trial scene features especially good acting and rhetoric.
I:1773;1030;The story means something new to me every few years.
I:1773;1031;Superb acting by Robert Shaw and Paul Scofield make this a tremendous story of an ordinary family man called to do something extraordinary.
I:1773;1032;scofield is brilliant as St. Thomas More .
I:1773;1033;showing us his human weakness as well as his strength and faith.
I:1773;1034;this is a moving and inspirational historical film.
I:1773;1035;This film stands as beautiful and timeless as the year it was released.
I:1773;1036;Seriously, this movie was amazing!
I:1773;1037;I loved watching it and it is worthy of all the awards it won upon its release.
I:1773;1038;This is a great movie because it has real substance.
I:1773;1039;if you are looking for a great story that has real meaning, then you will love this movie.
I:1773;1040;Our world needs more movies like this that showcase true courage and someone who stands up for his principles.
I:1773;1041;how great a country would America be if our Congress men and women had the courage of Thomas Moore.
I:1773;1042;man for All Seasons is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:1773;1043;If you are looking for a movie that is an accurate portrayal of King Henry V111, then, 'A Man for all Seasons' is a must see film.
I:1773;1044;It has an excellent cast with very strong performances from all especially Paul Schofield as Thomas More.
I:1773;1045;Well written and a great period drama.
I:1773;1046;I also like the little documentary on Sir Thomas More produced for the special edition, as it includes some intelligent interviews with scholars and a bit of insight into the history portrayed on film.
I:1773;1047;On the neutral side, this new disc is one.
I:1773;1048;sided, unlike the older release which had a full.
I:1773;1049;In any event, the film itself remains great, a tale of conscience featuring a Catholic saint whose story holds universal appeal .
I:1773;1050;Paul Scofield is great in the title role and is amply supported by Robert Shaw, Vanessa Redgrave, Leo McKern, John Hurt, and Orson Welles.
I:1773;1051;It's a talky film, but beautifully written and portrayed as a morality play, and worth seeing.
I:1773;1052;Loved the acting and the depth with which it portrayed the characters.
I:1773;1053;Very inspiring in this secular world and the message is critical.
I:1773;1054;The film opens with a messenger delivering a summons to Sir Thomas from the Chancellor and Archbishop of England.
I:1773;1055;i thoroughly enjoyed the film.
I:1773;1056;The costumes are magnificent and the scenery breathtaking.
I:1773;1057;What is most enjoyable is More's wit.
I:1773;1058;over 200 people have rated this movie as 4.5 stars.
I:1773;1059;So, the movie should be great.
I:1773;1060;strong storyline that shows a man of great conviction .
I:1773;1061;Both from a pure acting and historical perspective, this is a must view.
I:1773;1062;This film is an excellent adaptation of Robert Bolt's stage play, perhaps because he adapted it for the screen himself.
I:1773;1063;Very well cast, with two of the main players carried over from Broadway, Leo McKern as Oliver Cromwell and Paul Scofield .
I:1773;1064;in a rare film appearance .
I:1773;1065;This is a movie I re.
I:1773;1066;watch periodically, partly because it is so well done, and partly to remind myself of the importance of personal integrity and of faithfulness to those we love.
I:1773;1067;To me, the film and the play deserved all the awards they received.
I:1773;1068;a good transfer, and the included short documentary on the 'real' Thomas More is interesting.
I:1773;1069;This is one of my favorite films from the '60's, and I saw a superb stage production of it as well, two years before the film version.
I:1773;1070;A young Robert Shaw does a flamboyant and wonderful job as King Henry, but then, the entire supporting cast, as is common in British productions, is great.
I:1773;1071;all are elements of this fine film.
I:1773;1072;First of all, I agree with many of the 5 star reviews.
I:1773;1073;This movie is a fine shot in the arm for Robert Bolt and his play.
I:1773;1074;this is, a motion picture.
I:1773;1075;this very fine screenplay and very fine acting are all to the good however.
I:1773;1076;This film was a terrific drama, but the viewer needs to be aware that this was originally a play.
I:1773;1077;As previous reviewers have stated this is an excellent movie.
I:1773;1078;Paul Scofield's quiet, dignified portrayl of Sir Thomas More is one of the most riveting performances one will ever find.
I:1773;1079;Certainly More himself believed a much higher reward awaited him.
