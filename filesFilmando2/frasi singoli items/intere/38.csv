1;stanley kubrik directed so you know its a great great movie!there are a couple cool parts like these 2 duels.
2;kubrik means classic,dont forget that.
3;This film is presented to the viewer as it if it were real life which makes it so easy to accept it .
4;It is one person's life and has a sort of FORREST GUMP feeling to it , as someone whose life is all accidental .
5;the film takes its time , as it covers quite a few years in Barry's life , but is gripping if you will take the time to appreciate and settle into it .
6;A lot of effort has gone into creating the period look and feel and that makes the film potent .
7;the natural light and special lenses, built by the Carl Zeiss company for NASA, created fantastic visuals that never looked as good until this welcome blu.
8;the wonderful sound and music are also as great .
9;This is a perfect film that took a beating from some antsy critics and fans like myself.
10;"well lead was one challenge
I:8338;11;1975, directed by Stanley Kubrick, starring Ryan O'Neal and some folks with talent.
I:8338;12;this is a sweeping story of one man's life in the 18th century.
I:8338;13;Thackeray's narrative is featured in the film, and it's a delight.
I:8338;14;Wry wit, lovely understatement, satiric and sly with only a hint of cynicism.
I:8338;15;We can be perceptive without it.
I:8338;16;But hey, he looked pretty and he remembered his dialogue.
I:8338;17;That was more impressive than his hair.
I:8338;18;Since that was the best way to present this, Kubrick impressed me yet again.
I:8338;19;There's a reason this film won four Oscars, and I highly recommend it.
I:8338;20;First let me say that Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite filmmakers.
I:8338;21;It's a period piece, and it seems well researched.
I:8338;22;And the photography is beautiful.
I:8338;23;I heard somewhere that it was like watching a painting move.
I:8338;24;And that is pretty accurate.
I:8338;25;Kubrick paid very close attention to detail, and it is a very beautiful picture to watch.
I:8338;26;This is possibly one of the best, if not THE best, movies I have ever seen.
I:8338;27;The cinematography, the music, the acting, and the directing were the top of the line.
I:8338;28;They seem so real and intense, I forgot on several occasions that this was simply fiction.
I:8338;29;Every scene glows with warmth and beauty, and the characters look even more fine in their finery.
I:8338;30;one of the things I loved best about this movie was the fact that the protagonist, if you can call him that, isn't someone you can always sympathise with.
I:8338;31;barry Lyndon is in fact Kubricks masterpiece.
I:8338;32;Barry Lyndon is Kurick's bleakest movie and one of his best.
I:8338;33;This is a very unusual film for me to write about.
I:8338;34;When I watch a movie I like to be able to identify with the characters within the film.
I:8338;35;I like to be able to understand what they are going through,to be able to feel their happiness and sadness as well.
I:8338;36;This is one of the many things that movies are capable of being able to do.
I:8338;37;Even though we can't feel for the characters,I found the movie to be intriguing.
I:8338;38;The wonderful sets and costumes really grab your attention.
I:8338;39;As for his directing,well there's a reason he's seen as one of the best,he clearly WAS one of the best.
I:8338;40;This film should be viewed if only for the sets and costumes,O'Neal's performance,and Kubrick's masterful directing.
I:8338;41;This is a movie you can appreciate even if you don't enjoy it.
I:8338;42;based on a thackery novel, stanley kubrick makes his most perfect film here , if a bit too long the dialogue is authentic , the symbolism , frightening, and the ending tragic/comical.
I:8338;43;the most unforgettable scene is the climactic duel between him and his son, most intense.
I:8338;44;a gem of a film .
I:8338;45;I won't reiterate what the other reviewers said: I can only rant that it is a sweeping tale of a lifetime: and one of my very favorite films ever.
I:8338;46;It is beautiful, moving, and brilliant.
I:8338;47;the film is so beautifully photographed and the set design so amazing, that I was able to endure the 183 minutes of constant brooding looks by Ryan O'Neal as Barry Lyndon.
I:8338;48;The novel is complex, so I can't understand why Kubrick changed it and made it even more so.
I:8338;49;It is pretty tough to watch a film where I feel the lead actor is THAT awful"
50;ray version to really and fully appreciate the portraits in motion picture cinematography.
51;This is truly a masterpiece.
52;My husband said that it was the best film he had ever seen.
53;I also thought it was pretty wonderful.
54;One young, romantic, rakish man named Redmond Barry wishes to rise to this distinguished title: to have land, status, money, beautiful women, and to hobnob with the elite of the age.
55;The admittedly slow pace of the film reflects the slower pace of life of the age and also allows the viewer to take in the atmosphere much better than quick cuts and loud action allows.
56;This is a historical film in the best sense.
57;It does fit the mood, though.
58;Barry Lyndon is probably a film best seen on video, and absorbed in the comfort of one's home.
59;This is, by far, Kubrick's most underrated film and a masterpiece of historical filmmaking.
60;I think the best way to describe this film, is that it's more of a journey through the lead characters life, than it is a story with moral or purpose.
61;It contains remarkable footage of the Irish countryside, the British Redcoats, the Prussian army and opulent French parlours.
62;The most Kubrickian scene in this film is the horse scene and the scenes worth watching are the card games.
63;The card game scenes really give one a sense of life during the 16th Century, not to mention the impeccable cinematography and costumes showcased in the scene.
64;however, if after this first 30 or so minutes you are still tuned in, you are fully prepped for an engrossing and completely artistic experience of absolute joy.
65;It is a great period piece .
66;it is timeless film making .
67;interest was held throughout the entire film.
68;Ever so often one discovers a movie that, although not well known, has a credible pedigree and an enthusiastic fan base.
69;it is a VERY pretty movie.
70;"The sets, costumes, scenery, music, and horses are all breathtaking
I:8338;71;The music, though, can stand by itself, and is more worth the price than the movie itself is.
I:8338;72;inspiring authenticity and prettiness of this picture, and unfortunately, this comes across very strongly.
I:8338;73;This leaves the driving force of the film, the actors, as merely icing on a frivolous cake.
I:8338;74;a good actor can make even the most gratituous role into a stunner"
75;the rest of the cast aquits themselves very nicely, though, with the exception of the man who plays Barry's step.
76;literal adaptation of a classic novel?
77;mash of both, with the master of psychological movies fighting the bonds that come with adapting someone else's thoughts.
78;See especially the card game at the beginning, and the endless shots of Ryan O'Neal looking blankly into space.
79;all in all, this is a gorgeous movie with some very rousing battle scenes (albeit bloodless), but not much in the way of acting, drama, or substance.
80;The whole film is a work of art.
81;Clich d as that sounds, Kubrick (known for his perfectionism) really accomplished a cinematic feat in visually transferring works of art to film.
82;Scenes throughout the film really echo 18th century paintings.
83;The cinematography is some of the most beautiful ever done.
84;I will conclude by just saying the obvious, this is a visual masterpiece.
85;the movie is beautiful filmed and much better than I thought (with his lenght of 180 min).
86;Its dramatic, funny, satirical and yes, thrilling too.
87;A deeply fascinating, though not very comforting period drama, Barry Lyndon is an immensely detailed masterpiece that requires profound attention for all three hours it takes the story to unfold, but also proves very rewarding and memorable at the end.
88;On the other hand, the honesty with which Kubrick transforms this particular adventure into a period piece of utmost importance is breathtaking, and the visual style of the film earn it the merit of being one of the most gorgeous movies ever made.
89;Certainly not a movie to see as a substitute for the latest romantic comedy that's out of stock, Barry Lyndon is, despite (and maybe because of) this, one of the most wonderful cinematic experiences one can imagine.
90;A work like this one gives a good name to cinematography itself.
91;century Europe, is a gorgeous study in the beauties of light and stillness.
92;century landscape paintings, and at times the film resembles a moving painting more than a talking picture.
93;"Seeing a picture shot in natural light, where shadows shift and move at random across the actors' faces, reminds you just how artificial the ""normal"" light in movies really is."
94;roof great, and set a new standard for costume dramas, I had a harder time caring about the story.
95;"Maybe he was attracted to the duels: there's something about the combination of brutality and violence with the civilized trappings of rules, codes of honor, and glamorous hardware that reminded me a little of ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001."""
96;Ryan O'Neal does a fine job as Barry, but he seemed to disappear once he married the rich widow and the story lost a lot of its interest for me after that.
97;Warts and all, it's a memorable movie by an undisputed genius of film.
98;first, of course, is its gorgeous look which won deserved Oscars for the Cinematographer and others.
99;Much of the photography resembles the great paintings of English life in the 18th Century and the look and manner of everything has a complete authenticity.
100;The story of Kubrick making his own cameras and lenses to photograph candlelit scenes naturally is well known.
101;But it remains impressive, being the first and best approximation of what life must have looked like and been lived prior to electricity.
102;Perhaps this is a failing in a modern motion picture, but it was a courageous and daring decision to pace your film to these unhurried beats.
103;over narration is wry and offers often acidly arch observations of the story and characters is Kubrickian and certainly welcome.
104;so, this story of a rake's progress in attempting to climb and break into the world of aristocratic privelege and power has much to offer.
105;It certainly has an undeniable grandeur in its composition and look and it does offer us as good a glimpse into what life in the long ago past might have been like as any movie is likely to achieve.
106;Well, Leon, I was full of it!
107;With some patience, it is a worthwhile journey.
108;Viewed: 5/08, 7/13Rate: 85/08: Barry Lyndon is a superbly photographed flick that defines filmmaking in every bit but suffers from being emotionless, tediousness, and lifelessness.
109;Ryan O'Neal's finest hour probably only happens in Barry Lyndon, and he was great in his role.
110;"Stanley Kubrick's direction is exactly how films like Barry Lyndon should be made
I:8338;111;Only quite a few since 1975 are at par or better with Kubrick's masterful direction.
I:8338;112;Maybe it's truly representative of that era, that is, the 17th century.
I:8338;113;If there is anything that is perfect about Barry Lyndon, it is undoubtedly the cinematography work.
I:8338;114;I even love the costume pieces"
115;On the other hand, I really like Ryan O'Neal's performance.
116;All in all, I've enjoyed Barry Lyndon for the most part of it.
117;simply put, Barry Lyndon is the most beautiful film that I know of, and I've seen many films at this point.
118;This movie is gorgeous, and that is a severe understatement.
119;there are scenes in this movie that will move you to tears, they are so beautiful.
120;The stunning lighting (and you can read about how Kubrick managed this elsewhere online), the lavish and overwhelmingly complex sets and costume designs, the use of incredible classical music, the ever.
121;present brilliance of Kubrick's direction: this movie is truly an auteur at his most self.
122;inspiring uses of purple and orange and blue.
123;reign to his/her imagination and has the talent to make it happen.
124;of course, it is easy to overlook the many other fabulous aspects of this film.
125;One thing that is often overlooked in Kubrick films is the phenomenal acting abilities he managed to get out of his actors, and the emotional depth that he captures (while constantly being criticized as cold and unemotional).
126;while 2001 and Dr. Strangelove may vie for the best of Kubrick's unmatched career, and while I am partial to 2001's magnificence and inimitability, the objective observer in me must admit that Barry Lyndon, while certainly Kubrick's most underappreciated film, is probably his best.
127;If you loved the original film, you will be mesmerized by this remastered version.
128;Everyone who viewed this film by Stanley Kubrick commented on its period details and mastery of characterization.
129;This is of course Kubrick's best film.
130;It's amazingly gorgeous and features a great sound track.
131;Film critics in the 1970s totally misunderstood it because Kubrick was twenty years ahead of his time.
132;It's more of a painting than a moving picture.
133;This film is simply beautiful, a feast for the eyes.
134;Gorgeous cinematography captures the beauty of the English landscapes, beautiful sets and a nice score and screenplay (by Kubrick).
135;"Kubricks' film seems like a painting
I:8338;136;While long it is never boring and the actors shine, but the genius behind it is Kubrick.
I:8338;137;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 9!
I:8338;138;First of all, I could rave for several lines about the lighting alone, not to mention the costumes, the stunning locations in Ireland, Germany and England and the soundtrack .
I:8338;139;after all, it spans an entire war and the aftermath.
I:8338;140;But if you love good literature and beautifully crafted film, you will find this one well worth your time.
I:8338;141;Winner of 4 Oscars, this lavish, sumptous film captures debauched and bloody 18th century Europe completely and evocatively.
I:8338;142;just waiting to be swept away by the wave of revolutions about to hit Europe.
I:8338;143;There are some parts of it which are very funny and it is also very outrageous and uninhibited.
I:8338;144;This film is a biography in the most straightforward sense: It simply recounts the events of this historical person's extrordinary life.
I:8338;145;Kubrick's goal, one supposes, was to bring this character to life, for us to bear witness to his troubled heart.
I:8338;146;american pretty boy Ryan O'Neal as the Irish.
I:8338;147;While it is not the best Kubrick film ever made it is an enjoyable film none.
I:8338;148;the real star of the show here is the cinematography, the set designs and the costumes.
I:8338;149;The film looks so real that it seems that the viewer has stepped into an 18th century painting.
I:8338;150;while Barry Lyndon isn't as shocking as Full Metal Jacket or Clockwork Orange or as funny as Dr. Strangelove or as weird as 2001"
151;This film is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and one of the top movies of the last 50 years.
152;and cinematic tour de force it is .
153;he gives you a film that looks like it was actually shot 2 centuries ago, and impresses you with the absolute alienness of many of the characters.
154;"To not understand this is to not understand the movie
I:8338;155;And the film is so faithful to Thackery that Kubrick here delivers a major lesson: the only difference is placing a camera in it.
I:8338;156;One must remember that Kubrick started out as a photographer and that art is central to his entire ethos and point of view.
I:8338;157;Thus too, the silent but spectacular visual message goes, pictures now make us appalled by the tragedy of war, by the realities of racial and social discrimination .
I:8338;158;while the rake remains a rake, O'Neal brings wit to the part under Kubrick's tutelage and a large degree of empathy.
I:8338;159;The mercilessness of the whole enterprise would be wholly unpalatable but for the splendour and fullness of life recreated here, and the fire of Kubrick's eccentric passion to portray it.
I:8338;160;memorable scenes are too many to catalogue"
161;With this film, Kubrick establishes the camera not only as a step forward in technology, but a teacher fit to take its place next to the pen, the violin, the artist's canvas.
162;Ryan O'Neal is the lead character who lets success go to his head.
163;Thackery's lively wit is totally absent here .
164;While the 3 hour running time is staggering when read, I was pleased by how smoothly and swiftly the time passed while watching the film.
165;the imagery in the film is truly beautiful .
166;all in all, I'd say this is a great film with great performances by a great Director that pleasantly surpised me.
167;film fans will find plenty to rave about.
168;Barry Lyndon is, amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented.
169;Stanley Kubrick made many great films and this one is most definitely one of them!
170;"Look at the ones he's responsible for: ""Spartacus"" (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) ""2001"" (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and ""Barry Lyndon""."
171;Maximum Kubrick moments abound as this 18th century painting comes to life.
172;Title character is 18th century Irish rogue eventually finding his way into aristocratic English society.
173;I'm glad I waited to see it in the Blu Ray format in HI.
174;I've seen a few people say that this is in their opinion the greatest movie of all time, I think I'm starting to agree.
175;"For those who appreciate fine literature and fine art, ""Barry Lyndon"" is an absolute feast, visually, aurally, and dramatically."
176;as Redmond Barry, Ryan O' Neal's Irish brogue comes and goes, but despite that inconsistency, he acquits himself well.
177;Also worth noting is Michael Hordern's narrator, often seeming to express disapproval for the main character as he perceptively surveys his exploits.
178;the real star of the film is Kubrick and his production team who recreate the 17th century in a way that makes the viewer truly appreciate what life must have been like at the time.
179;The cinematography and art direction are peerless, as is Leonard Rosenman's score which adapts the work of some of the greatest classical composers.
180;"The patient viewer who gives ""Barry Lyndon"" a chance to work its magic will be rewarded with a true cinematic experience."
181;Arguably the least accessible of Kubrick's major releases, this film still remains the single greatest example of his recurring themes, ideas, and overall style.
182;Because he insists on a deliberate pace and stifled emotions, Kubrick captures the lifestyle of the 18th century better than any previous filmmaker.
183;In other words, this is a film literally taking place in a specific era rather than remaining a typically modern interpretation of past events.
184;A deceptively simple tale of an opportunistic cad who seeks (and loses) fortune and distinction.
185;serving characters, most prominently in the lead role.
186;Underrated, underappreciated, and ripe for revisiting.
187;Although the package art now carries a 2007 date, the disc inside is the same as the 2001 release.
188;Such a shame that WB won't do better by this overlooked masterpiece.
189;It may take awhile to relax into the atmosphere of Barry Lyndon but once you do give yourself over to its never ending pleasures you will experience one of the greatest films ever made.
190;A great story because i enjoy history type films.
191;I would recommend this film only if you have a few hours to spare and if you appreciate the intricacies of fine drama.
192;One of those perfect films.
193;I think this movie, along with Clockwork Orange, best capture Kubrick's love of visualizing stories and music.
194;It looks great on my 60 inch LG and the story is interesting!
195;looking film, wonderfully captured on blu.
196;And it is looooong .
197;ray release of this movie, it is undoubtedly one of the best looking Kubrick releases to date, in my opinion.
198;Simply brilliant in coldness, irony, aristocratic distancing, and very true to the XVIIIth.
199;This is one of the most well made films I have ever seen!
200;Kubrick really is a genius filmaker.
201;The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is very good, and the story is well done.
202;Ryan O'neal played his part excellently, a product of Stanley kubrick.
203;The acting throughout was super and thediversity O'neal played good.
204;set Direction, Best Cineamtography, Best Costume Design and Best Score.
205;The Film was also Nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture all by Stanley Kybrick.
206;The Best Thing about this Film is the exquisitely lush cinematography by John Alcott (Terror Train).
207;hard fans of Kubrick will love this one.
208;"Barry was one of those born clever enough in gaining a fortune, but incapable of keeping one, for the qualities and energies which lead a man to achieve the first are often the very cause of his ruin in the latter case.This is the theme, spoken by an unseen narrator, which runs through at the very center of Stanley Kubrick's majestic historical epic ""Barry Lyndon."""
209;Following a string of three masterworks, which, conventional wisdom has dictated, represent the creative peak of Kubrick's legendary career as a filmmaker, it was Thackeray's novel about the rise and fall of a young Irish scoundrel who rises the ranks of 18th century English nobility that the enigmatic artist chose to set his sights.
210;"Conventional wisdom also tells us that, beginning with ""Barry Lyndon"" in 1975 and as further pronounced in 1980 with the release of his horror opus ""The Shining,"" Kubrick's work began to display a diminished artistic resonance."
211;"These films, the feeling goes, lacked the visionary, complex implications of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the insightful social commentary of ""A Clockwork Orange."""
212;That is, until time alone was able to be the final judge of the film's legacy.
213;"Fortunately, subsequent critical revisiting of the film led many to finally come around to appreciate ""Barry Lyndon"" and regard it as the rich and giant masterpiece that it is."
214;kubrick himself was perhaps such a divisive and misunderstood artist due to his desire to tell stories against the grain of the usual approach.
215;He was most often interested in man's relationship to his society, and explored themes of broader conflict.
216;Quite simply, it is one of the most sumptuous, haunting, majestic, and gorgeous cinematic experiences ever realized.
217;The landscapes are epic and breathtaking, the interiors rich and elegant, and each shot composed with a painter's eye for design and detail.
218;Additionally, the costume and sets are impeccably designed (so much so that they garnered Oscar wins, as did the photography and the music), and Kubrick's use of classical music further heightens the sense of high art and elegance.
219;All of these production elements, coupled with a cast of actors who are in tune with the material and who embody the director's keen sense of genuine human qualities, bring to screen life an era in history with an authenticity that is often attempted but rarely ever accomplished so vividly.
220;It is purely the magical, visceral impact of the visuals that remains in our mind, and Kubrick puts great care into making everything count.
221;It is the quite moments that reveal so much more than any words could ever justify.
222;"In this film, however, the cinematic trickery is downplayed, as is necassary for the more elegant feel of the material, and the ever confident master artist takes great care in the more ""pure"" and classical elements of film storytelling that take root in the silent era."
223;cHARACTER ANALYSIS:Through the journey of Redmond Barry (played with brilliant subtlety and understated turmoil by Ryan O' Neal), Kubrick is able to communicate themes of moral decay, decadence, and duplicity that exist in the attainment of power and social privilege.
224;Kubrick communicates this with a zoom out as Barry stands alone on the grand balcony, a distant figure, weak and vulnerable, overwhelmed by his great castle and by great responsibilities.
225;it is interesting, though, that Kubrick places judgment not only on Barry, who is admittedly a dishonest rascal, but also upon the society in which his characters exist.
226;Instantly, his point is clear to us.
227;The classical scoring also adds an ironic contrast and counterpoint between the faade of nobility and the debauchery that many characters play a role in.
228;Working with this theme, Kubrick, with a distinctive sense of characterization and human behavior, allows us to understand what makes a man (and perhaps mankind itself) proficient enough to acquire power, privilege, and political clout, often through immoral conduct, and how he comes to destroy these institutions and himself.
229;One gets a sense that there exists a deep rooted inferiority complex with Barry's character.
230;destructive ambition for wealth and status) will favor our ability to maintain our good fortune.
231;All I would add is that the fencing scene is very well done, and not surprisingly, highly authentic, especially the last move done by O'Neil: the grab / behind the back stab maneuver is right out of contemporary fencing manuals of the time.
232;What is interesting though, is that they are both fencing left.
233;This is a wonderful movie .
234;I loved the accurachy of the music as he arrives in Prussia .
235;This is a powerful film and easily the most beautiful as for costumes and scenery, but it wasn't his best.
236;Don't get me wrong, this was an excellent film, but very unlike Kubrick films.
237;But do see this movie!
238;Barry Lyndon is Stanley Kubrick's forgotten masterpiece .
239;hole is his D. p. John Alcott who deservedly won an Oscar for Best Cinematography.
240;Shot in Ireland, Germany and England, the viewer constantly gets the feeling of viewing a classic 18th century painting.
241;the music is also wonderful, as Kubrick once again shows excellent taste in which music fits a particular scene.
242;The film's opening scenes have gorgeous Irish folk music from The Chieftains, and its later passages are eloquently followed by the works of J. s. Bach and Vivaldi.
243;Ryan O'Neal is adequate as Barry Lyndon, although his attempts at an Irish accent are so.
244;Both actors steal every scene which features them.
245;I got the feeling that Kubrick focused so much on the photography of Barry Lyndon that the film's acting suffered as a result.
246;If so, then mission accomplished.
247;Michael Hordern's narration helps explain the historical context to the viewer and gives a human perspective to things, but sometimes takes away from some of the film's drama.
248;pressed to find ANY Kubrick film with large amounts of emotional warmth.
249;I highly recommend taking a snack break or a quick walk during the film's intermission.
250;This movie is decidedly NOT mainstream Hollywood fare, and is a challenging and beautiful examination of the mores and prejudices of 18th century European high society.
251;Other writers have commented on the flim's sumptuous gorgeousness, its meticulous production values, its ground.
252;breaking technical achievements in lighting.
253;One of the longest scenes (the duel near the end) is absolutley compelling.
254;simply look like a series of great paintings.
255;This film has that look.
256;frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago.
257;ray of this is done soon and released as this film is worthy of a great, high.
258;for the visuals, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank.
259;hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too.
260;In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable.
261;It's no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring.
262;Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you'll really enjoy the soundtrack, toom under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.
263;not to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story.
264;"As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, ""Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,"" played beautifully by Ryan O'Neal."

266;key adventure story about the rise.
267;Mr. Barry is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French.
268;this is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears.
269;Admirers of this film need to see this in all its glory.
270;Stanley Kubrick made this right before The Shining, and they are two stinkers.
271;The cinematography is the real star.
272;This movie is really just a nice vacation in a lush countryside (a movie museum, if you will).
273;Visually stunning, deliberately paced story of a man who, despite his rise to riches and success, finds himself rejected by the highest strata of society.
274;Redmond Barry's story is much Kubrick's story.
275;worth, but always and forever doubting, seeing that his natural tendencies are, in the end, inescapable.
276;The sets, costumes and cast are excellent, but the real star is the film itself.
277;"The viewer should give himself the time to absorb it
I:8338;278;_Barry Lyndon_ is absolutely stunning to watch.
I:8338;279;Kubrick's masterful hand at orchestrating sweeping views of naturally lit countryside transports the audience into the 18th century and alongside our characters.
I:8338;280;Some complain that Kubrick, while commanding the visual aspects of the film, allows the acting to fall by the wayside.
I:8338;281;Kubrick and O'Neill have managed to capture a human being, one who defies the trend of most Hollywood films and popular fiction.
I:8338;282;For its visual appeal, it is worthy every penny, though it may leave some members of the audience wishing for quicker pacing and a plotline that is easier to digest.
I:8338;283;Just think that Stanley Kubrick, during the first scene involving Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson, around a game table, has given us one of the first video.
I:8338;284;The images fit so well with the Franz Schubert's trio that one is led to believe that Kubrick wanted to illustrate here a piece of music he liked and that what we see on the screen was inspired by Schubert's music.
I:8338;285;'Barry Lyndon' is that rare work of art, one which achieves what Walter Pater suggested all art aspired to: the condition of music.
I:8338;286;Its thematic development is in counterpoint .
I:8338;287;The narrative movement is as hypnotic and static and abstract as its Baroque score.
I:8338;288;Here, he manages to pull off a film that is at once philosophically serious and an emotional and hilarious character study.
I:8338;289;'Barry Lyndon' is also one of the few historical films that represents its world on its own cultural terms .
I:8338;290;the inertia, the tableaux, the pageantry are all true to the 18th century.
I:8338;291;There is a mistaken belief that great acting consists in excesses of emotion and grotesque gestures.
I:8338;292;O'Neal does this generously and brilliantly, and rewards Kubrick with one of the finest performances in the cinema, one that always has me blubbing like a big baby.
I:8338;293;The integration between 70's attitudes and 18 century life is amusing and interesting.
I:8338;294;This movie does it all for me, my favorite period piece drama, best period costumes, fantastic soundtrack and so much more to list.
I:8338;295;The acting paired with the music was brilliant also.
I:8338;296;I am an unabashed Kubrick fan.
I:8338;297;Why is it that """"Barry Lyndon"""" has in my mind surpassed other more revered works."""
298;You can cite the magnificent technical attributes of the film(cinematography,art direction, costume design,music), however, a technically proficient movie is not necessarily a moving experience.
299;Kubrick does a great job moving the story from Redmond Barry's youth to his downfall among the English aristocracy.
300;Kubrick has also gathered a great cast of actors here in supporting roles(Parick Magee, Leonard Rossiter, Marie Kean, Godfrey Quigley, Steven Berkof, etc.).
301;It is a daring performance and O'Neal is utterly convincing whether playing a headstrong teenager or a cold manipulator.
302;Barry Lyndon is a perfect example of a Kubrick film.
303;It may not be as good as a clockwork orange, or 2001, but it is the most beautifully filmed movie ever made.
304;Each set, each shot, is a victorian painting come to life.
305;If you were to study the way kubrick made film's (which is very distinct, you notice them when you become a Kubrick coneseaur) Barry Lyndon might actually be the best place to start.
306;barry Lyndon came out of the idea of Kubricks masterpiece.
307;it is the story of an Irish lad who scams his way into English nobility.
308;it is a great movie, and an Excellent Kubrick, and you should try it.
309;Barry Lyndon is a remarkable film presenting the unusual voyage of an Irish commoner into the great European courts and aristocracy.
310;there is irony in the telling of this brilliant film, (like Voltaire's Candide) but also there is great humanity in BarryLyndon.
311;"The music is haunting and powerful, it is a beautifully made film
I:8338;312;The movie is sumptuously staged and beautifully filmed, but in the end, it is rather a sterile exercise.
I:8338;313;There is something uniquely subtle about this film that Stanley Kubrick has achieved in that the viewer feels that he is seeing the pace of the 18th century characters come to life and how people lived and interacted with each other.
I:8338;314;I suspect a lot of this is simply fallout from the videogame.
I:8338;315;influenced crop of people that do the bulk of movie consumption these days, who simply don't appreciate the meticulous and carefully considered film making that Kubrick did.
I:8338;316;i've read Thackeray's novel, and I really think that Kubrick was true to the story, almost to the letter of the book.
I:8338;317;Even though the movie was long, it was so beautiful to look at, that I found it to be a pleasure, and the 3 plus hours just flew by.
I:8338;318;i especially loved the use of all natural light, including filming in candelight, and like other folks who have reviewed this movie, the frames were like pictures that had come to life.
I:8338;319;blown beauties, it was breathtaking.
I:8338;320;Stanley Kubrick's beautifully opulent production takes many liberties with William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque romance, The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq (1843), narrated in the first person depicting events from the eighteenth century.
I:8338;321;ryan O'Neal is the unlikely star, and he does a good job, rising from humble Irish origins to the decadence of titled wealth, employing a two.
I:8338;322;this really is a gorgeous movie thanks to the exquisite sets and costumes and especially to John Alcott's dreamy cinematography and a fine score by Leonard Rosenman.
I:8338;323;Both scenes are engrossing as we see the loading of the pistols with powder, ball and ramrod, and we are able to note how heavy the pistols are and how difficult it must be to hit a silhouette at even a short distance.
I:8338;324;It is this kind of careful attention to directional detail that absorbs us in the action and makes veracious the story.
I:8338;325;Also note the incredible pile of hair atop Lady Lyndon's head.
I:8338;326;Surely this is some kind of cinematic record.
I:8338;327;bottom line: one of Kubrick's best, certainly his most beautiful film.
I:8338;328;Incredible dialogue, wonderful story, an even an inspired performance by Ryan O'Neal.
I:8338;329;best performance from Ryan O'Neal, who is perfectly appointed as the handsome, rougeish opportunist of the movie title.
I:8338;330;The film is peppered with memorable supporting performances and lorded over by a wonderfully droll voiceover narrator (a Kubrick trademark!)
I:8338;331;dropping, oil painting coming to life visuals alone are worth the price of admission.
I:8338;332;History buffs will probably observe that Kubrick's trademark use of classical music is era appropriate for once!
I:8338;333;Like any true work of art, Barry Lyndon is something to be treasured.
I:8338;334;Even fewer filmmakers have undertaken that risk and were successful at it.
I:8338;335;Kubrick was both and that might be one reason why he is loved by so many film lovers all over the world.
I:8338;336;'Barry Lyndon' is a lot like many other Kubrick films.
I:8338;337;It is directed in stunning fashion, with several brilliant sequences throughout.
I:8338;338;It is beautiful to look at and the costumes great.
I:8338;339;If you appreciate good filmmaking you must watch this film!
I:8338;340;This is an artistic masterpiece for those who appreciation the visual arts.
I:8338;341;Like a great masterpiece Barry Lyndon's magic does not lie with a single character but with the work itself.
I:8338;342;Barry Lyndon's strengths lie in the totality of the film and in the immense beauty that is found in every scene.
I:8338;343;This film is grandeur immortalized, a picturesque view of 18th century Europe.
I:8338;344;This is a delightful film, and cannot be measured in terms of success and mass appeal, this film is well beyond that.
I:8338;345;This is, by far, Stanley Kubrick's best movie.
I:8338;346;Coincidentally, this is Ryan O'Neal's best movie though he told an interviewer that Kubrick drove him crazy during the production.
I:8338;347;This movie won a slew of Oscars for cinematography, best music, art direction and costume.
I:8338;348;this is an excellent film for couples.
I:8338;349;Kubrick was successful, I believe.
I:8338;350;Does it make any sense to make such a beautiful movie, just to state a trivial truth that there are 1000s ways for a man to screw his own life?
I:8338;351;I love this film because it is like watching several films at one time.
I:8338;352;There is the picaresque story of Barry Lyndon, full of love, duels, highway robbery, war, card sharping, and swindling the rich.
I:8338;353;You find yourself laughing at Barrys antics one minute and then that famous Kubrick camera will pull back and show you the rest of the larger picture quite literally.
I:8338;354;Perhaps Kubrick is saying that it is the society we are born into that does the corrupting or perhaps he is saying we are all by nature corrupt, you can make up you own mind.
I:8338;355;As costume epics go this one has plenty of adventure, from battlefield scenes to drawing room intrigue, and all takes place in a period detail rich atmosphere.
I:8338;356;The music is perfect too, as it always is in Kubrick works.
I:8338;357;Not my world view but it does make for an intensely enjoyable few hours.
I:8338;358;One of those movies that are so good you want to compare the experience to reading but of course Kubrick says as much with the way he frames his shots as many novelists do with words.
I:8338;359;Ryan Oneal has that kind of untouched by the world innocence, and also a very good confused and hopelessly lost look.
I:8338;360;And Marisa Berenson a very memorable beauty.
I:8338;361;BARRY LYNDON moves at a natural pace in telling the life story of a clever, charming Irish rogue who is brilliantly played by Ryan O'Neal.
I:8338;362;century Europe in elegant yet realistic fashion and is gripping from start to finish, incorporating both tense action and well.
I:8338;363;This film feeds its audience a huge slice of human comedy/tragedy without ever being preachy or forced in any way.
I:8338;364;bARRY LYNDON was my official """"favorite film"""" for many years before I stopped playing the """"favorite"""" game, and to this day, I can think of few works that match it in terms of simple fineness."""
365;I love Stanley Kubrick and this is I think his only true period piece.
366;ryan O'neal is wonderful, I remember seeing this film in the theaters when it first came out and now seeing it 35 year later its even better.
367;but besides all that, this film is a total tour de force and probably the best film ever made on life and times in the 18th Century.
368;Later he is at considerable odds with his step.
369;son, Lord Bullington, both as a child and later as an adult.
370;There are several battle scenes and a great deal of colorful marching.
371;"The scenery, both real and recreated, is stunning
I:8338;372;It may be a little long in some places (I think I could easily cut 30 minutes from this film with a little creative editing), but it is a real spectacle for the eyes and ears.
I:8338;373;Very interesting Thackeray tale spanning 3 hours with fantastic scenery and sets that make this a great work indeed.
I:8338;374;Definite Kubrick masterwork that looks excellent on blu.
I:8338;375;and the 5.1 sound is very good with decent separation and low end.
I:8338;376;well worth it for those who haven't seen it.
I:8338;377;If you like movies about psychological issues, this film is for you.
I:8338;378;Starts slow, but by the end, it is a very satisfying movie.
I:8338;379;paced, but richly detailed period piece.
I:8338;380;between 1 and 10, this lavish production with near.
I:8338;381;perfect cinematography, gets a 9.
I:8338;382;This is a Kubrick film.
I:8338;383;The great Stanley Kubrick was a bit of a cinematic chameleon.
I:8338;384;Barry Lyndon, then, is Stanley Kubrick's take on the historical costume genre.
I:8338;385;But something about the film nevertheless fascinated me.
I:8338;386;Yet, the film is glorious to watch.
I:8338;387;The cinematography of the film is absolutely breath.
I:8338;388;The film is *that* beautiful.
I:8338;389;And he created a special lens that was able to photograph in natural light and candle light .
I:8338;390;not a great feat nowadays but an astounding achievement 25 years ago when this film was created.
I:8338;391;The film won a well.
I:8338;392;deserved Oscar for cinematography, as well as for costume design and art direction and musical scoring.
I:8338;393;As far as the Academy Awards are concerned, this is probably Kubrick's most decorated film.
I:8338;394;Ryan O'Neil is Redmond Barry, and while some people may scoff at this casting choice, he does a decent job in the role.
I:8338;395;duels, especially the last one, are suspenseful and superbly filmed.
I:8338;396;And the romance scenes (in a Kubrick film?
I:8338;397;are sweet or amusing or lustful, depending on Kubrick's intentions.
I:8338;398;In other words, Warner Brothers transfered a decent print but made NO effort to restore it.
I:8338;399;Kubrick is one of our greatest directors"
400;"but as with so many of Kubrick's films, BARRY LYNDON has, over the years, come to be seen as a striking piece, worthy of the four Oscars it won in 1975 (Set Decoration
I:8338;401;This is perhaps because this study of 18th century manners, complete with jaw.
I:8338;402;droppingly gorgeous nighttime candelight scenes shot by Kubrick's favorite cinematographer John Alcott, is fused with a deeply clinical, and even cynical, attitude about human nature.
I:8338;403;Though the casting of O'Neal in the title role was considered a misjudgment on Kubrick's part, in retrospect it now seems like the right one.
I:8338;404;Berenson is also tremendous as Lady Lyndon"
405;"In particular, the adaptation of the D Minor ""Sarabande"" of Handel is used to grand and sometimes sinister effect."
406;For this, much of the credit must go to the late and often underrated Leonard Rosenman, who won one of this film's four Oscars for his adaptations.
407;In the end, though, the rewards are considerable.
408;This is one of my favorite movies of all time and certainly my favorite Kubrick movie.
409;I think that this is one of the best (if not the best) movies you will see about the 18th century and one of only a handful that is actually (imo) better than the original source/novel.
410;Even if you are not aware of the technical achievements, each scene is like a work of fine 18th century art.
411;"The film moves slowly so that we are able to linger in this magnificent world and marvel at the composition/color/light of each scene
I:8338;412;their inner life is for the most part, kept at a cool distance.
I:8338;413;The film more deserving of Blu.
I:8338;414;ordered, but I can safely rate it 5 stars based on the fact that Barry Lyndon rates 5 stars even in dog.
I:8338;415;I just revisited Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon several years after my first viewing.
I:8338;416;When I first saw it, around the age of 18 or so, I was expecting something closer to the Kubrick films that I knew and loved like 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining.
I:8338;417;Some bizarre characters, wicked twists, graphic violence, dreamlike scenes.
I:8338;418;it's an epic drama about the rise and fall of an Irish rogue in the late 18th century.
I:8338;419;It's a pretty conventional film.
I:8338;420;up a film like A Clockwork Orange with a costume epic set in the 18th century?
I:8338;421;Always taking the divergent path.
I:8338;422;The story of Redmond Barry is interesting, particularly in its historical context.
I:8338;423;Several wonderful scenes alone make the film worth watching.
I:8338;424;There are some sporadic scenes with dazzling camera work and Kubrick manages to sneak in a couple of his tracking shots.
I:8338;425;i don't think that anyone would claim Barry Lyndon Kubrick's greatest achievement, but it is a remarkable achievement nonetheless.
I:8338;426;Perhaps more accessible to mainstream audiences than his typical work, Barry Lyndon is definitely an enjoyable experience for fans of Kubrick, but perhaps more so for fans of lavish costume epics.
I:8338;427;So enjoy it for what it is, just don't expect any of the old ultraviolence.
I:8338;428;this is a masterpiece of direction and a masterpiece of film making.
I:8338;429;as for the performances all I can say is Ryan Oneal is hugely underrated, (look at Paper moon), watch """"whats up Doc"""", these are journeyman master performances in comedy and pathos."""
430;The man is misunderstood and vastly underused.
431;this film is eye candy to end eye candy.
432;, and here we have a masterpiece.
433;Besides, it is a sensitive, excellently told, touching story.
434;"suffering vision, she looks stunning, and she's perfectly directed by the master Kubrick
I:8338;435;And really, she does an excellent job.
I:8338;436;The rest of the cast is very good.
I:8338;437;Like watching it in the theatre.
I:8338;438;Another bonus is that Kubrick's original aspect ratio is quite close to 16:9, so the film fills most of the screen.
I:8338;439;Secondly, I would rank Barry Lyndon one of his best works.
I:8338;440;The cinematography by John Alcott is absolutly superb.
I:8338;441;Barry Lyndon is definitely one of the best photographed films of all time.
I:8338;442;It is an artistic masterpiece created so perfectly.
I:8338;443;The music is synchronized wonderfully with the actor movement, the camera movement and the narrator.
I:8338;444;Sure there isn't a car explosion every 13 seconds or a robotic grenade launcher roaming the streets of LA, but all the elements of cinema and art are beautifully assembled.
I:8338;445;I think everyone should see it and give it a try.
I:8338;446;As has been previously pointed out, the music, costumes, and in general, the art direction of this film are impeccable.
I:8338;447;The film is a joy to behold.
I:8338;448;Many interactions in the film are very subtle.
I:8338;449;The result is that most of the movie advances slowly, meanderingly, via minute detail and creates an overall mood for the entire picture.
I:8338;450;Also, the scenes when Barry is beating his step.
I:8338;451;core Kubrick fans, than for general audiences.
I:8338;452;It was like fliping through a beautiful art book.
I:8338;453;Stanley Kubrick seems to always have surrounded himself with some of the most talented people in cinema.
I:8338;454;This is what you pay a good director to do.
I:8338;455;A Kubrick masterpiece, this was by far O'Neal's best acting ever, and the cinematography makes every frame like an 18th Century painting!!!
I:8338;456;If there ever was a period film that puts you into the time it takes place Barry Lyndon is it!
I:8338;457;My favorite Kubrick film, my favorite film ever!
I:8338;458;Wonderfully lyrical and masterfully done like a masterpiece painting.
I:8338;459;This film is about cinematography and lighting.
I:8338;460;And they are thick with beauty.
I:8338;461;The candlelit scenes are famous, but some of the natural light work impresses me more.
I:8338;462;It took Kubrick's mania to make this happen, and it's consistent throughout the film.
I:8338;463;the transfer is absolutely excellent.
I:8338;464;And this was done so incredibly well that I have to give it 5 stars, despite me being a notoriously critical person.
I:8338;465;The beauty, the depth, and the mystery of this film are unsurpassable .
I:8338;466;what Kubrick was doing with light is just a miracle.
I:8338;467;In one scene Barry (Ryan O'Neil) was having a dinner with a German woman who was feeding her baby and the candle light made the whole scene look like a Caravaggio's painting.
I:8338;468;This is just one of many scenes.
I:8338;469;Each of them is perfection and harmony.
I:8338;470;Costumes and sets were crafted in the era's design.
I:8338;471;If nothing else, watching """"Barry Lyndon"""" is pure aesthetic delight ."""
472;and there is one man responsible for it, Stanley Kubrick.
473;"If ever divine film was made, ""Barry Lyndon"" was it and Kubrick could've quoted the Bible ."
474;God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good.
475;Barry Lyndon is the most compelling and compassionate realization of the inevitable finality of everything in this world which was presented by the visionary director with elegant sensual melancholy.
476;in the 18th century, and suddenly hoisted into a world of adventures that are scarily unpredictable and yet a lot of fun .
477;based movie where, I think, the film is just as important and just as good as the novel.
478;I've watched it over and over, and it remains fresh!
479;A very enjoyable period comedy with narrative overlay attuned to its 18th century sensibilities.
480;As a historian and expert in material culture I found the sets, the costuming, and dialogue amazingly accurate, especially the interior and nighttime scenes lit by candlelight.
481;This work is a beautiful production.
482;The scenery, costumes and lighting are superb.
483;I enjoyed most of the story.
484;It just keeps getting better and better .
485;Guess I should have read the book.
486;But I do watch it again and again.
487;This movie is gorgeous to see.
488;kubrick is a master .
489;this film is representative of his many strengths as a director .
490;Barry Lyndon is good movie and I'm happy I saw it.
491;Add to that the Kubrick sense of tone and irony, with a narrator stepping in from time to time to give a somewhat amused overview and finally you've got a movie that is quite watchable.
492;It doesn't take long to get into, the filming is gorgeous and the recognizable touch of the master is unmistakable.
493;"It's a study of character and a study of ""nobility"" perhaps, in both senses of the word."
494;The new 5.1 soundtrack is okay but nothing really spectacular.
495;It is still a beautiful and highly entertaining film (I've always considered it one of Kubrick's very best) and I'm thrilled to get this much improved version.
496;I would surely enjoy seeing these particular actors on the stage in person.
497;skilled and their craft is quite brilliant.
498;It is one of the most breathtaking beautiful films ever committed to celluloid.
499;The photography alone is enough to see it (try to see it in a theater).
500;Christianne Kubrick, Stanley's widow, said this was her favorite film of Stanley's, as the framing is reminiscent of paintings of the period, and Christianne is a renowned painter whose paintings were used in many of her late husband's films (like A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut).
501;Ryan O'Neal is quite good as Barry, a scoundrel and a cheat who gets his comeuppance by the end of the film.
502;Leon Vitali (who went on to become Kubrick's personal assistant up until Kubrick died) is astonshingly good as Lord Bullingdon, Barry's stepson and nemesis.
503;It's a pleasure to sit through such a beautiful film such as this.
504;The film won several Academy Awards (though not for Kubrick himself).
505;It won for cinematography, art direction, and music score.
506;Stanley Kubricks's long picturesque saga of an Irish rogue in 18th Century Europe is certainly the most entertaining costume drama ever made.
507;Each frame of the film is filled with visual splendor as meticulous as a classic painting.
508;Panoramic battle scenes and richly detailed costume and set designs come alive as from an artist's palette.
509;The pistol dueling scenes are outstanding.
510;IN A NUTSHELL:This is true 5.
511;is stunning and framed with precise narration by Michael Hordern.
512;Ryan O'Neal gives his most sensational.yet.
513;measured performance in his greatest role.
514;Like the film, he rises to unexpected heights although his heights are of infamy and honor, a strange combination.
515;These tend to reveal themselves at times when the cowards and mice among him are reeling from the moment as Redmond shows undeniable courage and honor.
516;It is possible to see this man and his journey through life as many things at many times and this is where the film shines.
517;:As all the components of the scenes build a life for Redmond, we feel empathy for a man who might not otherwise be worthy of it.
518;Stanley Kubrick eliminates any notion of sentiment or nostalgia and we see the naked truth.
519;As the film rolls this suddenly becomes very poignant and then, somehow, the 3.
520;"In Rashomon, we felt some empathy for the ""rapist."
521;"Unlike ""Rashomon"", which was the depiction of the interpretation of one incident, ""Barry Lyndon"" is seen in a rich full world depicted in color and literally filled up with everything we need to see and to understand the complex era of the Thirty Years War in Europe and decades, not hours, of the protagonist's journey through life."
522;The pacing, the sardonic narration, the breathtaking cinematography, the unerring score.
523;Certainly my affinities for photography and art history were thoroughly rewarded, but I also found the storytelling strangely compelling as well.
524;Which is why I sat through the film twice, on the BIG screen, within the first few weeks that it opened.
525;The soundtrack to BL is also highly recommended.
526;reviews are coming out on the web and they are consistently praising the transfer done on this edition.
527;hungry social climber, and is quite relevant to our present world.
528;at any rate, the film is also a masterpiece of atmosphere and style.
529;Despite Kubrick's reputation as a rather emotionless director, there are plenty of funny scenes.
530;the innocent look on his face as he cheats his opponents gets funnier every time you see it.
531;It's still damn fine filmmaking.
532;"The novel Barry Lyndon is truly a picaresque novel with a rascally, lively narrator far removed from Ryan O'Neal's very understated portrayal
I:8338;533;In this respect Kubrick has taken the skeleton of plot from the novel, and laced it with copious amounts of Kubrickian flesh.

I:8338;535;Acting,cinematography,music,intelligent and crisp dialogue,set and decors.
I:8338;536;costumes and settings were very realistic the story line absorbing.
I:8338;537;I have no idea how much, if any, the novel differs from the film but the film is just beautiful, and the blu.
I:8338;538;It is so sharp and clear and there are no black bars top, bottom, or sides of the screen.
I:8338;539;I don't know about aspect ratios or any of that, but I have a widescreen tv and it fills the screen completely.
I:8338;540;i love the narration, and the lovely landscapes are indeed like paintings.
I:8338;541;I would highly recommend adding this to your collection.
I:8338;542;I go back and forth between this and The Godfather for my favorite film, somedays it's one, somedays it's the other and somedays it's a tie.
I:8338;543;Although his directorial presence is still very much active in the cinematography and style of the work, the entertainment value to be found is nonexistent.
I:8338;544;This is possibly my single favorite film """"of all time""""."""
545;It's just about the sickest, loopiest, best idea ever.
546;minded), and our hero is actually an anti.
547;That's a good word for this film: sublime.
548;"but perhaps ""strangely sublime"" would be better."
549;"Art that's ""too profound"" just makes you feel all tingly and inspired, or perhaps ""awed"" or ""frightened"" at best."
550;"To be really ""sublime"" you've got to say ""screw it"" to the world and all expectations and drive forward with a kind of blind, relentless madness."
551;There is an undeniable element of fatalism and determinism here: a kind of Spinozistic single.
552;There are so many things going on, so many connections and events and times and places.
553;It's a fascinating piece that provides much insight into how Kubrick thought and made films.
554;The costumes are impeccable, indeed downright gorgeous.
555;The details regarding furniture, horse furniture, glassware, uniforms, even playing cards is astounding.
556;The indoor scenes are shot by candlelight to give the proper feel.
557;Ryan O'Neal is handsome and ever so charming in this role.
558;Totally fun and enjoyable to watch!
559;When director Stanley Kubrick lensed a film based on William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Barry Lyndon, many fans wondered why.
560;Barry Lyndon may well rank as the finest piece of cinematic art made in the last thirty years.
561;I personally love watching period piece films, and this movie ranks at the very apogee of the pictures from the genre that are often made but rarely successful.
562;The only other film I have seen that matches Kubrick's eye for detail and flair for style is Eric Rohmer's The Marquise of O, another film lifted from the pages of an early nineteenth century writer.
563;Fortune smiles when the Irishman saves the life of an officer, an officer with connections to the ministry of information.
564;de Balibari is actually an Irishman living in exile, a fact that causes Redmond Barry to confess his true identity to the man.
565;The Chevalier, impressed with such honesty, promptly takes his fellow countryman into his confidence.
566;The two form a plan that allows them both to sneak out of the country, whereupon they take up lives as confidence men and swindlers on the continent.
567;Redmond ingratiates himself into Lady Lyndon's graces to the point that when her husband dies, the good lady marries our hero.
568;Lyndon knows his success depends on his wife, so he spends enormous sums to curry favor with the court.
569;Barry Lyndon is an intriguing film.
570;One wonders why Kubrick made it.
571;Perhaps the movie is a morality tale about a ruthless scalawag eventually getting what he deserves.
572;The set pieces and costumes are phenomenal, the acting wonderful, the photography breathtaking.
573;Especially developed for this film was a special camera lens that could work by candlelight.
574;arguably the best element of the film is the way Kubrick places his characters in a way that resemble paintings of the period.
575;You can literally see characters move into position and pose as though for a portrait.
576;The lavishly wide shots, deeply setting backgrounds and foregrounds, the stillness and quiet serenity in the candlelight settings, it all combines to bring cinema as it hardly is presented: As a beautiful medium to share an idea.
577;this film is a passion, of a great director, one of the finest, and in no better way, do we see a delicate movie handled with such patience, and enriched care as we do with Barry Lyndon.
578;For the sensitive, for the emotion, for the ones who see cinema, and see a medium, unmatched in its possibilities: This is the movie that you need to take another step with.
579;Progress, and perhaps, take in a new breath of pleasurable, fresh air in love of cinema all over again.
580;A first love of mine.
581;A feast for the eyes.
582;This film underscores Kubrick's mastery of creating a visual extravaganza tapping into his experience as a photographer.
583;Each shot is a masterpiece of color, detail and composition.
584;Watch this on a high definition large screen.
585;Probibly the most beautiful movie ever made.
586;The story is capturing too.
587;It was all done with a newly developed lense and candle light.
588;A true work of art.
589;There is something about Stanely's movies where once you see a moment of his film, you can't turn away until it is over.
590;"Barry Lyndon , unlike many movies which trip all over themselves to twist the audiences expectations, does take it's time
I:8338;591;Every character, every set, every line of dialogue, every frame has been touched by a craftman unequaled in his lifetime.
I:8338;592;From the highly detailed production design to the flowery, and at times, comical dialogue Kubrick has created a true vision of life in aristocratic Europe.
I:8338;593;the film is both a literary and visual masterpiece.
I:8338;594;Only a novel could be so rich in detail while mantaining it's overall theme.
I:8338;595;always a visual genius, the man invented a new lens system so he could film the whole thing with natural light.
I:8338;596;To me, it's one of the funniest movies ever made.
I:8338;597;The fact that Kubrick made it also makes it one of the best.
I:8338;598;Pair it with The Duellists for a nice Napoleonic double feature.
I:8338;599;Stanley Kubrick did an excellent job recreating the 1700's in style, costume and scenery.
I:8338;600;Ryan O'Neal portrays a rogue excellently and he is captivating in the role of Barry Lyndon who is a dashing and charming """"gentleman of distinction""""."""
601;O'Neal and the rest of the cast make this an entertaining movie to watch.
602;Another great movie by the late Stanley Kubrick.
603;A critic described the unique locations and lighting, and overall photography of the movie as high renaissance art on film.
604;The music is haunting in the movie and the narration adds tremendously.
605;Great passion lies just beneath that icy surface, and it sometimes breaks out with great drama.
606;The film contains real brilliance.
607;The final duelling scene deserves to be a cinematic classic, the choice of music and its synchronicity with the action is sometimes almost unbelievable .
608;not to mention perfect acting and stunning visuals.
609;The characters are richly drawn.
610;In other words, the epic proportions of the film do not fit the modest subject matter.
611;Nonetheless, the brilliance in this film is real, and it is well worth repeated viewing.
612;The film operates at a very subtle level, and it requires the viewer to rise up to that level to appreciate it right.
613;For a very interesting review of this film, see [.]
614;I absolutely urge any fan of poetic cinema or Stanley Kubrick to invest in a copy of this movie, but better to wait for a beautiful transfer of one of the most beautifully photographed films ever made.
615;A hipster friend once told me Kubrick was his favorite director.
616;"was the answer, confirming my suspicion that ""Lyndon"" is an underrated work even among Kubrick devotees."
617;thwarted in his desire to film a Napoleon biopic, Kubrick turned to William Makepeace Thackeray for inspiration and the result is an arrestingly beautiful, strangely haunting, and thoroughly original work of cinematic art.
618;"In two parts separated by an intermission, Barry Lyndon follows the rise and fall of one Redmond Barry, an 18th century Irishman whose good looks, ingratiating manners, talent for fighting, and cutthroat ambition mark him for something ""greater"" in life than tending farms."
619;"For all its visual pomp and splendor, ""Barry Lyndon"" remains one of the strangest, most idiosyncratic films I've ever seen."
620;I can only account for my own experience, but the effect for me is more mesmerizing than yawn.
621;Kubrick's mastery of the film medium is such that he recklessly breaks all rules of movie storytelling and yet I'm hypnotized by the painterly images and evocative classical soundtrack.
622;Barry Lyndon belongs on a shortlist of the most physically ravishing films ever made and is worth seeing for that reason alone.
623;It's pure cinema, distilled to a gorgeous interplay of sight and sound.
624;Redmond's seduction of Lady Lyndon, for example, is a wordless sequence that travels from the gaming table to an outside veranda in a breathtaking ballet of glances, meaningful expressions, unspoken emotions, and quiet gestures.
625;set scenes feature stunning scenery and a lovely, lilting theme composed by that great Celtic band, the Chieftains.
626;ryan O'Neal, never known as a great actor (to put it mildly), is nevertheless perfectly suited to the part of the rogue.
627;Though his Lucky Charms Irish accent comes and goes, O'Neal captures an essential innocence and sweetness to the character that allows the audience to keep with him through thick.
628;In that moment, Redmond deserves the name of hero.
629;"because of its slow pace and storytelling idiosyncracies, I'm always hesitant to recommend ""Barry Lyndon."""
630;"Though not for all tastes, ""Lyndon"" is that rare cinematic beast: a truly personal expression by a formidable artist."
631;Its rewards are rich and abiding.
632;This is an utter masterpiece.
633;Every single frame of this movie looks like a perfect painting.
634;The story is very interesting.
635;I saw the movie when it was first released in theaters and, like my initial reaction to many of SK's films, it took a few years, and many viewings, to fully appreciate its greatness.
636;Kubrick arranges each scene like a master painter bent before the canvas.
637;person tone of its source material for the observations (written by Kubrick himself) of an omniscient narrator, brought to orotund life by the late Michael Hordern, the director still manages to stir our sympathies in favor of his flawed protagonist, delivered in a great, underrated performance by Ryan O'Neal at the peak of his prettiness.
638;"Barry manages to build a comfortable life for himself by taking advantage of nearly every person, and opportunity, he meets along the way
I:8338;639;In the realm of King Stanley, we are all equal in the end.
I:8338;640;like all Kubrick films, the overall impact is made considerably greater through his use of a musical score, and Barry Lyndon's soundtrack is arguably the best of all his films.
I:8338;641;Lush and elegiac, he uses a combination of well.
I:8338;642;known classical and baroque pieces to create a soundscape that is almost as vibrant as the images onscreen.
I:8338;643;Stanley Kubrick's """"Barry Lyndon"""" is one of the most breathtaking experiences you'll ever encounter in cinema."""
644;Every single frame breeds life, due to pioneering lenses Kubrick created to capture the essence of the story in natural lighting.
645;Kubrick is certainly a genius.
646;Wonderful and award winning costumes.
647;A haunting and moving score, which Kubrick selected personally.
648;1975 film was ignored at the box office, mainly due to it's length of 183 minutes, but every minute is gorgeous.
649;A moving painting set to music.
650;"Overall, ""Barry Lyndon"" is a perfect example of what can happen when a director succeds with an uncompromising vision."
651;"To see the true beauty of Stanley Kubrick, is to see ""Barry Lyndon."""
652;while the acting of ryan o'neal still leaves something toi be desired, everything else about the movie stands out: a subtle script, fine performances, and of course magnificent to look at.
653;it doesnt rank in my own list with his 4 great science fiction films (strangelove, 2001, clockwork, eyes), but thats more a matter of personal preference.
654;ray, on a decent size screen, the beautifully designed and photographed images of a past long gone spring vividly to life.
655;This movie's exquisite images are a wonder to behold on Blu.
656;In my opinion, it's the next best thing to watching a brand new 35m print on screen in a well equipped cinema.
657;Barry Lyndon is one of the greatest films ever made (in my opinion).
658;If Stanley Kubrick had to be remembered for one film then this is the one.
659;Beautifully filmed and directed, Kubrick also manages to get the best performance ever out of the highly underrated actor Ryan O'Neil.
660;I have never seen such a masterpiece of a film.
661;Witty banter and perfect framing and cinematography makes this film a must see.
662;Great stuff from a master film maker!
663;anyway, cinematography is A+, as well as the acting.
664;This is one of the greater films from Stanley Kubrick because of its incredible story telling.
665;It's long, but it's all good content.
666;Watch this if you wanna see somethin' good.
667;Stanley Kubrick's 1975 epic Barry Lyndon was released in the nine years between two of his most well.
668;known films, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining.
669;office returns and received a cool reception from critics.
670;True of all the films Kubrick released between 1968 and his death in 1999, critics have warmed to the film and what was once considered his most underrated is now considered one of his best.
671;This is a Kubrick film through.
672;Barry Lyndon is a film of many layers, a sweeping epic that moves in a hypnotic, dream.
673;like way and in unafraid to poke fun at its subjects while taking itself seriously.
674;Due to its length, it's one of the hardest Kubrick films to just sit down and absorb but it proves to be one of the most rewarding.
675;Part one, which lasts half of the running time, is sub.
676;"titled ""By what means Redmond Barry acquired the style and title of Barry Lyndon."""
677;"As the film is an ""epic,"" the viewer is invited to accompany Redmond from this point on through all the peaks and valleys of his life."
678;He joins King George's army, becomes a deserter, and eventually ends up in the Prussian army.
679;"This leads to part two, ""Containing an account of the misfortunes and disasters which befell Barry Lyndon,"" in which Redmond, now known as Barry Lyndon, climbs the social ladder and welcomes a son, while feeding the hatred of Lady Lyndon's own son Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali)."
680;It's pacing is elegant, moving with no hurry.
681;There are scenes that play in that fascinating, Kubrickian way and scenes that film buffs can immediately identify as Kubrick, yet the absolute presence of the master is not as prominent.
682;I've always found tone and atmosphere to be the most striking aspect of a Kubrick film, but the most striking thing here is the way it looks.
683;Kubrick was always an artist in the way he used images yet this may be his most luxuriously shot, beautiful film.
684;The film won Academy Awards for costume design, art direction, score, and cinematography, making it the Academy's most awarded Kubrick film.
685;Not only is this technically innovative, but it's effectively dazzling as well.
686;As a result, his eye for casting and his ability to direct actors to precisely capture the correct tone for their performance is often overlooked.
687;"Redmond Barry is a fascinating character, the ""hero"" of a historical epic who remains a static character throughout and displays an emotional disconnect and indifference to the events that take place around him."
688;For all it lacks in emotion and charisma, O'Neal makes up for it with intensity.
689;Vitali gives a marvelously austere and delicate performance that seems to go unmentioned in discussing this film.
690;His character is one of the most dynamic and emotive of the film and many of his scenes are elevated by his performance.
691;"The duel between Barry Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon, for example, is masterful in Kubrick's hands
I:8338;692;Barry Lyndon may not be the most iconic film in his repertoire, but it is a complete treasure.
I:8338;693;A stunning masterwork that hasn't aged a day, it's such a rich, detached, memorable, and cold film that stands as a true work of art.
I:8338;694;At face, the movie is deep.
I:8338;695;The music is great, as Kubrick movies tend to be.
I:8338;696;The story manages an air of a documentary, with subtle digs against European Aristocracy.
I:8338;697;I had seen this film years ago and had carried with me through the years a memory of a truly engrossing evening at the movies.
I:8338;698;Story, scenery, charactgers, mujsic .
I:8338;699;For me, Kubrick's best film.
I:8338;700;Every scene is beautifully sculptured, and Kubrick did his absolute best to immerse his audience in the zeitgeist, from the costumes to the sets and landscapes to the ethereally.
I:8338;701;This is as close to being a perfect movie as I can name.
I:8338;702;Despite the fame of the director, this gem of a movie remains relatively unknown and very underrated.
I:8338;703;Its most striking aspect is the cinematography .
I:8338;704;at times BL feels like a Renaissance painting in motion"
705;I think this is the most beautiful movie ever created and its soundtrack is amazing.
706;Indeed, he has to rely on the position and cleverness of others to succeed.
707;O'Neal effortlessly conveys this, and yet when his character is called upon to be ruthless and physically violent, he does so with satisfying abandon.
708;The narration is perfectly done .
709;the photography is overwhelmingly beautiful.
710;The cinematography constantly evokes the landscape paintings and prints of the time.
711;"They stand like portraits of themselves
I:8338;712;he certainly sounds archly Victorian enough.
I:8338;713;The movie has moments of intense beauty, and you have to admire Kubrick's determination in realizing those moments.
I:8338;714;Not a Method Actor, he simply speaks the lines and looks handsome, which is all that's required.
I:8338;715;If you imagine De Niro in this role, you'll soon agree with me, I think, that O'Neal is great casting.
I:8338;716;all in all, a (mostly) absorbing rise.
I:8338;717;One of my favorite movies and deserving of four Oscars.
I:8338;718;The film is beautifully acted with a realistic portrayal of Thackeray's 18th Century novel, and it will be included in a new book about some of Kubrick's works being written by an English professor at an Ivy League college.
I:8338;719;I got interested in Kubrick work when I bought 2001 on blu ray, the equisite depiction of space, and shots of the moon surface were captivating, so I started looking at some of his other work, until I stumbled upon this one.
I:8338;720;this is by far the best cinematography I have ever seen, as a matter of fact, Kubrick used a special lense built by Carl Ziess for NASA apollo moon exploration program, with the incredible 0.7 F stop, highest ever used in film history ( up until now no film maker has even tried to use that lense).
I:8338;721;Certain scenes Kubrick uses three candels to light the entire scene, thats it, a perfect work of art.
I:8338;722;As with all Kubrick movies, you need to watch it more than once to discover it more.
I:8338;723;Definitely a captivating display of images.
I:8338;724;That is unfortunate because I believe this an excellent film in just about every respect: a compelling and witty story (it's really a comedy more than anything else), beautiful sets and locations, costumes and lush cinematography are among its many delights.
I:8338;725;Despite the three hour length and relaxed pacing Kubrick's assured direction and the strong performances preclude any sense of boredom.
I:8338;726;I saw and enjoyed this film when it was released in 1975 and enjoyed it even more in 2002.
I:8338;727;everything looks clear and vibrant.
I:8338;728;My only quibble is with the score which won an Oscar for best adapted score .
I:8338;729;In Barry Lyndon, it seems like Stanley Kubrick takes great pains to distance his audience from the drama.
I:8338;730;He is certainly not a likeable protagonist.
I:8338;731;The acting is good enough, though, and the film presents us with characters that are interesting to observe for a time.
I:8338;732;visually, the film is magnificent.
I:8338;733;It practically oozes period, every pore saturated with 18th century.
I:8338;734;There are gorgeous costumes and sets, as well as photographic lighting and composition that are truly breathtaking.
I:8338;735;It seems like the Barry and his drama are not the central point of the film, but more an important part of a greater aesthetic whole.
I:8338;736;This film has an amazing sense of rhythm, and as the camera moved hypnotically, the scenes played out, the music sounded, and the dramatic motifs recurred, I found myself becoming more and more engrossed in this lush and beautiful work.
I:8338;737;Beautiful score and amazing cinematography.
I:8338;738;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:8338;739;kubrick carefully, meticululously crafts this age, and conveys it to the viewer in a way which makes one feel that a series of beautiful 18th century paintings have been brought to life, revealing the entire story, only hinted at through static art.
I:8338;740;It's the resulting fullness and honest balance of the story which unnerves at first, but rewards when less casually considered.
I:8338;741;It is a film masterpiece of the first order.
I:8338;742;Watching this movie is similar to walking thru the finest art museums of Europe.
I:8338;743;Every frame will seem hauntingly familiar, as though you had seen a painting, somewhere, that reminded you of what you are now viewing.
I:8338;744;Without a doubt, this is the most wonderful cinematography ever made.
I:8338;745;In truth, the story line is secondary to the primary purpose.
I:8338;746;to show off the art of composition, lighting, framing, design, and all the other elements of the visual arts.
I:8338;747;Kubrik's deep knowledge of 18th and 19th century painting and of that era's music combine to form a visual and aural delight.
I:8338;748;Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a magnificent work of art.
I:8338;749;It is achingly beautiful with sumptuous costumes, perfect music, gorgeous scenery, and magical cinematography.
I:8338;750;Suitable for seeing again and again, because it is a great work of art.
I:8338;751;if you are an artist or an art lover, you must see this film.
I:8338;752;Although the movie was a bit slow and long, parts of it were very good, especially the battle scenes of 1700 European warfare and the duel between Barry and his stepson I found to be very realistic and dramatic.
I:8338;753;Kubrick was a genius of cinema, a master of telling stories with pictures so loaded with meaning that often no dialogue was needed.
I:8338;754;Almost every single shot here looks like an Old Master painting, perfectly composed, a joy for the eyes.
I:8338;755;I'm pretty sure Thackery would have loved this version of his novel, though his take on the life of real.
I:8338;756;life rogue Andrew Stoney is somewhat more openly satirical than Barry Lyndon.
I:8338;757;Yet there are many very funny if rather quiet bits of humor here.
I:8338;758;My favorite is the opening of the second part"
759;the main thing to remember here is that this is a picaresque film, in the best of ways, and that means long character revelation is the thing.
760;Ryan O'Neal is good, though I might have liked a bit more overt humor from him.
761;All the acting is solid and never detracts from the procession of beauty, while some performances, especially Leon Vitali as the hilariously pouty Lord Bullingdon, are exceedingly excellent.
762;"Kubrick knew how to get the best from his actors
I:8338;763;this film is for those who like their stories shown more than told, and the third person narrator, as opposed to Thackery's typically Picaresque unreliable first person narration, sets up the scenes quite nicely, and then Kubrick's insanely crisp visual sense takes over.
I:8338;764;ray, Barry Lyndon is it.
I:8338;765;PLEASE give this work of art the respectful treatment it deserves, and issue it in full splendor in hi.
I:8338;766;kubrick made almost a dozen masterpieces, and this is certainly one of them.
I:8338;767;For sheer sumptuous eye candy, it may be top of the tree.
I:8338;768;stanley Kubrick molded Barry Lyndon into one of the finest films of the 20th century.
I:8338;769;Applaud the film God's for their creation of pure joy.
I:8338;770;It certainly makes it's way into my top 3 Kubrick films, along side of A Clockwork Orange and 2001.
I:8338;771;thank you for reading my opinion.
I:8338;772;Here is Stanley Kubrick's most beautiful and eloquent film, taken from the novel by Thackery, of an 18th century slacker turned hustler turned wealthy denizen who ends up the same way he started .
I:8338;773;It is a morality tale to compete with those of that other great English novelist, Dickens.
I:8338;774;filmed in natural lighting in fine European settings, this is Kubrick's most opulent and staggeringly beautiful film.
I:8338;775;Two things, in my mind, separate this film from a typically great film: casting and the use of music.
I:8338;776;dimensional actor that could not find a second dimiension even with this wonderful script and when being directed by the world's greatest filmmaking genius.
I:8338;777;my second complaint is the way the music is done in this film.
I:8338;778;Kubrick understands music and its effects and still allowed this to happen thoroughout this otherwise splendid movie.
I:8338;779;i will never be long between viewings of this movie, for it is a work of art rare in moviemaking.
I:8338;780;I was appalled, thrilled, baffled and fascinated.
I:8338;781;I remember it as the most realistic movie I've ever seen, and not most of all in the sense of its exquisite mise.
I:8338;782;This ethical vacuum creates intense discomfort and a pressing need to fill it with an interpretation.
I:8338;783;Therein is the beauty and the satisfaction of it, if any.
I:8338;784;I don't enjoy his work.
I:8338;785;This, in fact, is my favorite Kubrick movie of the four I've seen.
I:8338;786;even so, I think Barry Lyndon is more watchable than the other three.
I:8338;787;Not one of the characters is likeable.
I:8338;788;When misfortunes happen to the hero, Mr Barry, it's fine with me.
I:8338;789;in 1975 Kubrick hadn't gone quite so far off the deep end, and what we have here is a movie with a lot of strong points, able to sustain our interest, more or less, for three hours, a story well told, with some very interesting scenes.
I:8338;790;I can almost give it a thumbs up.
I:8338;791;I was curious to see Barry Lyndon because it was accorded a rare one.
I:8338;792;It's everything the other reviewers have said of its remarkable evocation of bygone era.
I:8338;793;I was enthusiastic about it, and so were my fellows watching it with me, all the way up through the intermission period.
I:8338;794;first he was a nice rascal, then he was a mean one.
I:8338;795;be that as it may, I would certainly recommend anyone with an interest in period furniture, art, history, whatever to see Barry Lyndon .
I:8338;796;It is a painting come to life, and I only wish I had been able to enjoy the second half as much as I had the first.
I:8338;797;Perhaps the most underrated film ever made.
I:8338;798;Barry Lyndon is one the most beautifully crafted films in any genre.
I:8338;799;Barry Lyndon, more than any other film, captures the essence of the 18th century.
I:8338;800;The costumes, cinematograghy, and settings are all beautiful.
I:8338;801;Ryan O'Neal, who plays Barry Lyndon, is quite good in the title role.
I:8338;802;Actually, important and interesting things happen in every scene.
I:8338;803;Barry Lyndon is an Irish scoundrel who is determined to climb up the ladder of the strict British class system.
I:8338;804;The film has a subtle sense of humor like the duel between Barry and the fearful Capt. Quinn.
I:8338;805;The seduction of Lady Lyndon by Barry in and outside of a gaming room is wonderfully done.
I:8338;806;Bryan's (Barry's son) deathbed and funeral scenes accompanied by Sarabande music are powerful.
I:8338;807;When Barry was in the Royal Army he got into a fistfight with another soldier.
I:8338;808;But Barry was more cunning and quicker so he won the fight.
I:8338;809;There's a lot more but you really have to see it for yourself.
I:8338;810;The film itself is a 5 star film.
I:8338;811;Well I just watched one of the most impressive movies in the history of film.
I:8338;812;Stanley Kubrick's quietly glorious and ironically realistic 1975 masterpiece BARRY LYNDON.
I:8338;813;It is mostly filmed in natural light, rendering sweeping shots which resemble a renaissance painting.
I:8338;814;Yet possibly the greatest thing about BARRY LYNDON is the fact that all the actors transcend their craft and present thoroughly realistic characters.
I:8338;815;I am beginning to suspect that is one of Kubrick's key strengths, his ability to somehow coerce actors into wholly transforming into their characters, lock, stock, and smoking barrel.
I:8338;816;this is with out a doubt Kubrick's best work.
I:8338;817;But I think it's perfect.
I:8338;818;but the directing is flawless.
I:8338;819;that is, Kubrick is meticulous in documenting the lives these people lead but stands at a distance from his own material, refusing to offer any real judgement or conclusions regarding the proceedings.
I:8338;820;hour mark, I can always tell whether the person is enthralled or would rather go and get ice cream.
I:8338;821;but the film has some marvelous touches.
I:8338;822;Marisa Berenson and O'Neal engage in a kiss that has to be one of the most memorable in screen history"
823;the painting analogy is accurate, by the way, for the whole film.
824;speed lenses originally developed for NASA!
825;the result was a movie featuring some of the most beautiful images ever captured on film.
826;"Even detractors of ""Barry Lyndon"" agree that, visually, this is a landmark in cinema history."
827;i heartily recommend the film, but only to those who still have not been seduced by the ultra.
828;I saw this at a theater when I was younger and have always remembered it.
829;It was sad, then happy, and then sad but the story and Ryan O'Neal's performance were outstanding.
830;this is my favorite Kubrick film.
831;the greatest film director kills it with this movie, and proves once more why he is the very best.
832;add this to your movie collection, i promise it will be one of the highlights of it.
833;They managed to 16x9 enhance 2 full frame films of Kubrick.
834;WHY didnt they put in just an iota worth of extra effort to be proud of?!
835;I got this as part of the Kubrick box set.
836;it took a couple viewing to absorb it all, but it is a fine story and a great piece of cinematography.
837;Kubrick's most lyrical film, even sentimental in his own sort of way.
838;I truly believe this is Kubrick's best work.
839;It requires one to think and appreciate the true art of cinema.
840;This, ladies and gentlemen, is definetley Kubrick's finest (or at least #2).
841;Watching this film is like looking at a great moving portrait, thanks to Kubrick's excellent cinematography, and the choice to film it with a Ziess superspeed lense (which made it possible to film by pure candlelight).
842;"This film
I:8338;843;To any lover of beautiful cinema who has NOT seen Barry Lyndon.You are missing a JEWEL!This will also allow you to see Ryan O'Neal in a perfect role.
I:8338;844;Kubrick was a master of film making.
I:8338;845;it was a very well done historical period movie.
I:8338;846;i found it very compelling.
I:8338;847;You aren't going to be holding on to the arm rests or on the edge of your seat but he relates the story very well.
I:8338;848;So I give the movie 5 stars.
I:8338;849;def makes an important difference with Kubrick's movies .
I:8338;850;So much of """"Barry Lyndon"""" consists of pure image and music, and so many of the images are meant to intoxicate, that the film needs to be seen in the best possible technical presentation."""
851;def releases of their other Kubrick films are any indication, it will be worth it.
852;ray will be great, like the other Kubrick movies on Warner Bros.
853;This is truly a spectacular film, but not for the reasons typically mentioned.
854;such as the great cinematography or fantastic directing (although both are splendid).
855;What makes this film particularly good is the abstract story that is told.
856;(And in this case, it has to do with entering into nobility.
857;The second half of the movie has to do with Lyndon's downfalls.
858;This shows that even a person who rises through the ranks and is popular and wealthy can have a serious of setbacks.
859;A film that was technically ahead of its time, Barry Lyndon was Stanley Kubricks desire to take the audience back in time to 1700s Britain.
860;His unique compositions that make it look like you are viewing an 18th century painting and his storytelling sensibilities make this film a timeless masterpiece and one of the most beautiful films ever made.
861;released in December of 1975, this is Kubricks most painfully human film with strong emotional power and brilliant performances.
862;This is still one of my favorite films and I highly recommend it.
863;Yet I found it to be elegant, almost poetic in its pacing.
864;I found my attention so riveted to the screen that I barely noticed the passage of time.
865;for any fan of Kubrick, all the qualities that characterize his best films can be found in Barry Lydon.
866;The characters are drawn with great precision, and portrayed vividly.
867;Each image, each scene is painted in crystal clear detail.
868;As for me, I think it ranks among the best of Kubrick's films, and among the best of all late 20th century films.
869;Stanley surprisingly romantic in his depiction of Barry Lyndon.
870;Ryan O'neil also receives 3 stars for his portrail of a spoiled, ambitious, and overgrown child.
871;I probably will enjoy this movie more the second time and appreciate more the direction and mood of one of the great story tellers.
872;Filmed entirely w/natural lighting, this is a great movie.
873;It does however, take more than one viewing to fully appreciate it.
874;In fact, the soundtrack is one of the finest instances of just how complementary a score makes a movie a MOVIE.
875;Ryan O'Neal has and never will be noted as a great actor, but he fits the part distinctly.
876;For someone who is not really into movies of that era this movie kept my attention completely.
877;This movie kept my attention from beginning to end and its a movie you will want to see over again and again.
878;I think this is my favorite Stanley Kubrick film,and he has so many great films.
879;barry Lyndon is a great screenplay surrounded by wonderful scenery draped in the elegant costumes of the eighteenth century,and enveloped in the beautiful timeless music that came from the age.
880;stanley Kubrick's brings out a superb performance by Ryan O'Neal,and Marisa Berenson in this poignant tale of an Irish youth struggles and travails of making his place in an era where good fortune and ruthlessness go hand and hand in making ones mark in society.
881;i enjoy this film everytime I see it.
882;Often underrated, this is Kubrick at his best.
883;The cinematography is, of course, breathtaking, lavish and restrained at the same time.
884;Together with Paths of Glory (1957) and Full Metal Jacket (1987) it makes a monumental Kubrickesque War.
885;Ryan O'Neal is just adequate, holding up his end mostly with good looks (as usual).
886;That said, there is so much good here that I cannot give it less than five stars.
887;A couple of scenes bring goosebumps, without any special effects or manipulative music, and this is rare enough in itself to merit any number of stars.
888;The opening scene at cards is amazing, as is the scene with the German mother and her baby.
889;The acting, direction, costumes, lighting, and script are all top.
890;I've watched it five times now and I love this film more than ever.
891;The magestic beauty of every single shot in the film ranks with Remington masterpieces.
892;The authenticity, pacing and brilliant arangement of score create an auditory and visual symphony perfecty coreographed to draw in a careful veiwer.
893;Kubrick always keeps his story the first priority however.
894;Watch the artist at the peak of his career.
895;This film is visually stunning.
896;And as in all Kubrick films the music is an integral part of the film.
897;The technical aspects of the film, when he used a special camera to film by candlelight.
898;A fine print was being exhibited by the university at an appropriately large theater auditorium.
899;Now was my chance for personal redemption!For a solid three hours I was transfixed by the images, sounds, and rhythms of another time and place.
900;Scenes unfolded by way of sequences of slow zooms on static interiors and painterly detailed exteriors, always punctuated by beautifully framed wide landscapes serving as segues.
901;"The characters' expressions, conversations, and speech patterns reflected their time and place
I:8338;902;Duels and battle scenes were presented as equivalent parts of a grand tapestry as opposed to high points of action in a screenplay.
I:8338;903;Everything moved and transpired at the """"speed of life"""" of another time."""
904;In fact, the consistent deliberateness with which every movement was staged in the film helped lend a semblance of dramatic cogency.
905;"Any sense of irony is also incidental, but for this viewer, it ultimately made the ""journey"" of experiencing this film that much more worthwhile."
906;Taken as such, it succeeds marvelously.
907;That moment was appropriate and well.
908;I believe you'll be amply rewarded.
909;Amazing photography that is studied in film schools as most all the lighting is done with candles.
910;Very pleased with the price and level of service.
911;Just the dueling scenes has the best acting ever captured on film
912;"piece'
I:8338;913;Kubrick delivers again"
914;Beautiful photography, well deserving of its Academy awards.
915;"the French Liutenant's Woman"" but I truly think Kubrick's writing of Lyndon captures the elegant sense of what life was like in the mid."
916;"As a setwork at a secondary school work of English Literature in South Africa, we studied in great detail Thakaray's ""The Adventures of Henry Esmond"" which captures the very same society and the writing is pretty similar."
917;Havjng studied that Esmond novel in great detail, and then saw the movie of Lyndon, I can with conviction say that Kubrick's take was accurate to the point of obsession in every detail.
918;and in my opinion it EQUALS Thakaray's brilliant and compelling story, both book and film are equally moving, and Kubrick hones in on important pieces with much brilliant editing of plot and character.
919;but Americans are puritanical, even today (This explains the same luke warm, reaction to Kubrick's materpiece Eyes Wide Shut).
920;one very special kudo to O'Neal who was excellent throughout and had a flawless Irish accent.
921;By the way the casting was simply superb, even the smallest roles and the credits note far fewer people than those employed in Avatar for instance.
922;The scene is exquisite and one feels the erotic heart beats of both players.
923;The only words that describe it are monumental, epic, a moving painting.
924;Kubrick at the peak of his powers and using all the tools of his craft to exquisite effect.
925;The film immerses the viewer in the period and into the lives of the characters much like a great novel.
926;One of a handful of films that not only nourishes the viewer but is supremely entertaining.
927;The style and pace of the film are reflective of the style and art of the period.
928;Glad I got to watch a young Ryan O Neal.
929;A sprawling tale of quick tempers, lust, and deception in the 18th century, Barry Lyndon is a truly magnificent film.
930;Whatever you think of the story, the actors, the dubious casting of Ryan O'Neal, you should watch this movie simply to see the art of cinematography at its highest form.
931;An absolute feast for the eyes.
932;But I think displaying the film at its correct aspect ratio is ideal.
933;Its the greatest film kubrick ever made.
934;And it looks like its fresh out of the bargain bin.
935;I throw up in my mouth every time I see the sound of music sell for 80 bucks in a jumbo set.
936;It is a narrative epic of an empvorsished Irish upstart (Ryan O'Neil) whose ostracism sets him off on adventurous journeys into the high and low society of 18th century Europe.
937;Although the acting is somewhat uneven, the force of the narrative is brought through more by Kubrick's brilliant stylized sceneries and moving music than acting talent.
938;The screenplay is well paced and the cinematography is impeccable.
939;Shot in natural light, Kubrick gives the audience a lush sequence of images that capture the individual themes of the story.
940;apart from these minor details, the film is a masterpiece of directing and cinematography.
941;"If you like this film, I would also recommend Riddley Scott's first feature film, ""The Duellists"", with Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel."
942;He must also be a professional hypnotist to have so many sheep under his power.
943;"Kubrick's cinematography is superb
I:8338;944;There is some truth to these criticisms, but the total experience is well worth the investment of time.
I:8338;945;There are so many mediocre films put out nowadays, you might as well watch something intelligent, well.
I:8338;946;Watching this film feels like reading a great classic novel.
I:8338;947;This is a wonderful movie from my all time favorite director.
I:8338;948;The story is very interesting, but above all, just look at this move: every scene belongs on a picture hanging from your wall, is so beautifully and masterfully composed.
I:8338;949;The balance, the colors, the shades, the light.
I:8338;950;Even without a story, just for the plastic and aesthetic value of each scene, is worth viewing, savoring and admiring.
I:8338;951;I have nothing but bright things to say about this 1975 film so where do I begin .
I:8338;952;He soon finds himself on the continent and right at the heart of period wars.
I:8338;953;He subsequently links up with an old card sharp who helps to expand his fortunes but Barry wants more.
I:8338;954;Barry is a sympathetic character from start to finish, albeit he can be a bit of a scoundrel at times.
I:8338;955;The locations, the sets, the props, the filmscore, the camera.
I:8338;956;but his performance in this film turned me around on both his remarkable skill as an actor as well as his clear adaptability.
I:8338;957;I was also very pleased to see one of my personal favorite actors, Patrick Magee, (Dementia 13) in his flawlessly cast role as """"The Chevalier."""""""
958;"and it is presented in a ""matted widescreen"" format, (which is a sort of ""expanded letterbox"" aspect and which looks great on a widescreen television.)"
959;The film is rated PG.
960;It's all just spectacular and it has easily earned my highest rating of five stars.
961;if you liked this film you will surely also enjoy a more contemporary entry which employs the same sorts of themes:The Duchess.
962;This film also uses zooms.
963;But Kubrick often uses them to start tight on some object or person and then very slowly pulls back to reveal the larger world.
964;the story is darkly funny and tragic.
965;Barry gets himself into all kinds ofunpleasant situations but this movie ranks as one of the master's greats.
966;"Customer service has promised a full refund, but I'd been looking forward to seeing the movie again, even if it was only the ""2000"" edition."
967;This is the picareque tale of Barry Lyndon set in Eighteenth century Europe.
968;stunning imagery, superb use of music, meticulous attention to detail .
969;Indeed this may well be Kubrick's greatest achievement on film.
970;Ryan O'Neal is excellent as the eponymous Irish rogue, although interestingly, Lyndon fades into the background about three.
971;Barry Lyndon is exciting, one.
972;riveting to watch despite it's three hour length.
973;I have quite a few classic films on Blu.
974;i think The Searchers and Barry Lyndon look the best.
975;the existing light scenes are breathtakingly beautiful.
976;"The film is not my favorite Kubrick
I:8338;977;thackeray is my favorite 19th century writer, and this film misses the biting satire of the novel.
I:8338;978;The 5 stars is for the photography, sets, and costumes.
I:8338;979;this is one of the best looking films ever.
I:8338;980;We see and experience life as it once was: and the pace is much slower than we're used to.
I:8338;981;So MTV doesn't always rule, OK?Visually enchanting, musically sumptuous (with a little help from the Chieftains) and authentic in its depiction of dress, customs, speech and class distinctions as it is, Barry Lyndon is essentially the story of a life.
I:8338;982;What Thackeray had in mind in his novel was to transcend period and plot, to show something more eternal about human nature.
I:8338;983;One genius has handed on the torch to another.You remember once being a better person.
I:8338;984;But life got in your way and ever since you've been on the run.
I:8338;985;There's so much you want, and you know what will happen if you don't get it.
I:8338;986;Just one of us, mired with the same fate as us all.
I:8338;987;It takes the perspective the film gives in looking back at the 18th century though to reveal the immense feeling Kubrick has for his characters, and for us all.
I:8338;988;In some ways the best acting is on the part of the narrator, who has all the best lines.
I:8338;989;Beautifully made film with a great story behind it.
I:8338;990;Kubrick is the greatest director in history.
I:8338;991;One of his most underrated films ever.
I:8338;992;I'm aware of the many criticisms leveled against this film, but I consider it to be one of Kubrick's finest, and it's one of my all.
I:8338;993;Perhaps more than in any of his other films, he makes effective use of a seemingly endless stream of striking images and gorgeous music to create a highly atmospheric ambience.
I:8338;994;fire action, appealing characters, and an event.
I:8338;995;ray transfer so that we can finally see the movie as it was meant to be seen.
I:8338;996;Nicely directed, good cinematography, but it is only a 70s movie and probably should stay there.
I:8338;997;And that just describes the cinematography.
I:8338;998;This has to be one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8338;999;The storyline, the cinematography, the music, the acting.
I:8338;1000;Musically superb with acting above par.
I:8338;1001;I'd give it at the very least 10 stars.
I:8338;1002;and yet enlightening words as well.
I:8338;1003;i cannot figure it out yet, but the film is so complex at times, what with all its entrances and exits that perhaps Kubrick felt that the audiences' imagination would be advanced by the """"help"""" it provides."""
1004;it is funny, because in many ways nothing has changed.
1005;so much of his downfall comes to issues that are with us as vividly today as in the late 18th century.
1006;o'Neill is MAGNIFICENT in his role, and in what perhaps is a rather too quiet, inconspicuous part Marisa Berenson shines as well.
1007;the little she did tells you that at least when it came to a soignee woman filled with dignity she was so unforgettable.
1008;"pictorially RICH, edited magnificently, the whole affair proceeds quietly, destroying ""innocent"" lives along the way in a most sober, cooly."
1009;lives filled with hope for JOY and beauty.
1010;destroyed by the serendipity of chance, place, circumstance, and yes, perhaps to an extent, character.
1011;as close to our human existence as an artist can get.
1012;it shall reward us more as we watch again and again.
1013;I think Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's best film.
1014;Don't get me wrong, I love all of his films.
1015;This underrated Kubrick film is gaining appreciation and veneration as time passes, and now rates as one of his masterpieces.
1016;In my opinion, it now rivals 2001: A Space Odyssey as among his best.
1017;Warner Brothers did a magnificent job in transfering the original master to the Blu.
1018;BARRY LYNDON is a film I first saw in Amsterdam in the 1970s.
1019;there has been nothing but a smile on my face since I received the wonderful remastered version of BARRY LYNDON, and I watch it weekly!
1020;Big fan of Epic type movies and I loved Ryan O'Neil but this movie did not make me love either one.
1021;Kubrick presides over important advances in cinematography (for example, all natural lighting), plus a pretty good story.
1022;Dueling scene exceptional, and likely as close as we can get to 1780's rural England.
1023;the costumes are great and the military actions are well done.
1024;Barry Lyndon represented a huge step forward technically for Kubrick and the film is a masterpiece in many respects.
1025;At times it is like looking at a great painting come to life.
1026;The story is a compelling drama based on Thackery's novel.
1027;There are moments where the marriage of picture and soundtrack may actually surpass that of any other film I've seen.
1028;Other elements that are superb in this film are the costumes and the supporting cast is a vast and incredibly talented roster of character actors.
1029;I love period based films and this takes you away into a wonderful era.
1030;A young Ryan O'Neal is very easy on the eyes.
1031;This is one of the most original films that I have ever seen.
1032;It turns so many notions of normal hollywood filmmaking on their head that I think it is great satire based on realism.
1033;the duel with his step son .
1034;the result is a marvelously lush tour of the underbelly of the late 18C British aristocracy in the context of the wider society, with strict attention to period realism.
1035;When action abruptly occurs, and there are plenty of vivid bursts of it, it comes too late to do much good.
1036;O'Neal is brilliant as a guileful fool.
1037;But this is a classic.
1038;but I've seen it before and its a great movie so hopefully amazon will get this fixed as other movies had sound.
1039;Somewhat dismissed when it was first released, it now holds a far more respected place in the best 100 lists of film critics and film fans.
1040;Martin Scorsese names it as his favorite Kubrick film.
1041;kubrick wanted the film to be as perfect a mirror of its 18th century setting as possible.
1042;He studied the landscape paintings of the era, especially those Watteau and Gainsborough.
1043;John Alcott's extraordinary cinematography must be seen on a big hi.
1044;def display to fully appreciate this vivid, eerie, ethereal, lucid dream of a movie that only gets better with age and repeated viewings.
1045;gaze into this shimmering mirror of another time and place.
1046;Stanley Kubrick's brilliant, if odd, overlong, and uncommercial epic finally shows up on blu.
1047;This troubled epic has always been a favorite with me, and I wanted a better looking version than the very early, non.
1048;bones deal, but it looks truly gorgeous.
1049;this is one of the most incredible blu.
1050;It's still Kubrick, intricate, odd, one.
1051;This takes patience, but I've always found it to be wildly rewarding.
1052;Firstly, I would like to say that I recognize Kubrick as a director with an amazing vision of how films should look, and he certainly portrays Redmond Barry's world with extreme beauty and an attention to detail never since achieved in any costume drama.
1053;indulgent films I have ever seen.
1054;Kubrick films exude his unique style, however that is all there is to this film, Kubrick style.
1055;His talent for cinematography is unrivalled, and just for that this picture is worth three stars.
1056;films, however, need more than just a great score and cinematic artistry.
1057;the character of Barry is unlikebale at best, and throughout the film, his success and rise into the upper echelons of society is given to the fact that he is full of energy and determination.
1058;this film is watchable because of Kubrick's talent, and unfortunately that is not quite enough for a film to hold one's attention for three hours.
1059;I enjoy collecting old and excellent movies.
1060;This movie is captivating and is more like reading a novel than watching a movie.
1061;"The score is beautiful
I:8338;1062;No grand explosions, no CG, no car chases, no edge of your seat suspense but the story line keeps you entertained.
I:8338;1063;This is a rare movie that I will rewatch many times in the future.
I:8338;1064;what a gift this is, Mr. Bezos!
I:8338;1065;New Yorker Stanley Kubrick tying to get into the good graces of the British media by making a British costume drama.
I:8338;1066;Lots of Hammer horror movies set in olde tymes are more fun to watch.
I:8338;1067;This movie has such a great story and it captures your mind.
I:8338;1068;I love this movie and recommend it to people of any age.
I:8338;1069;Barry Lyndon is one of of the few films you really feel experiencing being in the past.
I:8338;1070;There must be lots of material of the production and design of the film.
I:8338;1071;This is THE Stanley Kubrick film that deserves the better treatment.
I:8338;1072;The gorgeous cinematography and the impeccable lighting that capture the lush greens castles of Britain are a sight to behold.
I:8338;1073;He places the viewer *into* the eighteenth century.
I:8338;1074;A sharp contrast to today's fast and furious approach to film.
I:8338;1075;much more to savour than to devour.
I:8338;1076;A spectacle in a class by itself.
I:8338;1077;One of Stanley Kubrick's best movies"
1078;Period details are exquisite and lush, on par with Merchant and Ivory films.
1079;"print ""Collection"" of his films."
1080;16X9 TVs are more accurately described as full.
1081;either way, it's still a great movie, gorgeously photographed and including all the hallmarks of his inimitable style.
1082;Yet, this is one of my favorite films of all time.
1083;I've never see a time period so perfectly evoked on film as Barry Lyndon.
1084;18th century England is brought alive through extraordinary candle.
1085;This film has a strong cult following and to me, it's easy to understand why.
1086;It's a unique cinematic experience.
1087;I rated this a one star entry hoping to catch someone's eye.
1088;This is absolutely Stanley Kubrick's best movie.
1089;The battle scenes are great, the music is beyond great, and Ryan O'Neal (the worst actor of his generation) doesn't ruin the film.
1090;"remember: ""Money well timed and properly applied can accomplish anything."""
1091;By method of Michael Hordem's sonorous narration, much of what O'Neal has to do is look handsome in his 18th century wardrobe.
1092;She is not an incredibly gifted actress, but she is indeed, an incredibly gifted beauty.
1093;honored Hollywood tradition that still lives and breathes today.
1094;Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Musical Adaptation.
1095;I had known about BARRY LYNDON for a while, and it was one of those films that I always wanted to see, yet wanted to wait for the right time to watch it.
1096;Well, I just watched it today, and I have to say that I loved it!
1097;I would consider it one of Kubrick's best films.
1098;the film is perfect in every way, from the direction, the acting, the score, and the lighting (yes, the lighting).
1099;It's one of the most beautiful films that you will ever see.
1100;ryan O'Neill is wonderful as Redmond Barry, an Irishman who falls into high society during his life, which ultimately spirals out of control near the end.
1101;This film has the feel of a great novel.
1102;At three hours, the pacing is brilliant, and you will find that it flies by in no time at all.
1103;The story is so engrossing and the characters so well drawn, that I can't imagine anyone having a hard time sitting through it in it's entirety.
1104;If you are impatient when it comes to films such as this, which are epic in nature, I would still encourage you to give it a try.
1105;It is definitely a film that you will never forget.
1106;"Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" is a costume drama with a morality lesson at its core."
1107;Its tragic tale of one man's rise and fall still remains relevant to this very day.
1108;The charming rogue quickly takes a liking to high.
1109;Barry Lyndon is another technical masterpiece from Kubrick.
1110;The film is meticulously detailed and beautiful to look at.
1111;Of special note are the battle and candlelight scenes.
1112;crafted and impressive in scope while the latter have a rich and romantic lushness to them.
1113;The running narration provided by Michael Hordern also is very good and adds an amusing and insightful dimension to the story.
1114;Barry Lyndon has a running time that may scare off some viewers but rest assured that the film moves at a surprisingly brisk pace.
1115;Those with the patience to sit through it will be well.
1116;Barry Lyndon is one of Stanley Kubrick's best films.
1117;It is impeccably crafted, and is edited in such a way that it flows with the music so as to envelope you into the world.
1118;barry Lyndon is truly a classic, and will stand the test of time.
1119;I have, for many years, loved and appreciated the work of Stanley Kubrick.
1120;Its genius lies in its cinematography and the use of natural light employed by Kubrick (the story of the camera use and style itself is legendary).
1121;This is a film of singular genius and can be watched with the sound off, as the acting of the lead characters (Ryan O. neal and Marissa Berensen), is wooden and the dialogue is minimal, however, this adds, rather than subtracts, to the story.
1122;The acting of the ensemble back up actors however, is splendid, and overwhelms the stilted and vapid personas of the leads.
1123;anyone who loves cinematography and costume, and nuance in plot and characterization will love this film.
1124;produced, stunningly photographed movie that ranks among Kubrick's best.
1125;Kubrick, a photagrapher himself, used natural lighting when shooting interiors, and you can see the attention to detail from the first frame to the last.
1126;But while it may be Kubrick's most visually stunning film, it's also among his weakest.
1127;The rest of the supporting cast fares much better.
1128;While this film pales in comparison to his classics like A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon has virtues of its own to make it watchable.
1129;View with an open mind, and you will be rewarded.
1130;This is how the perfectionist, detail.
1131;Stanley Kubrick, was perhaps, our greatest film maker.
1132;And 'Barry Lyndon', was one of his greatest efforts.
1133;It is one of the most gorgeous looking films in the history of cinema.
1134;It will take your breath away.
1135;Thackeray's novel about the vanity of ambition has much in common with the apes in 2001 and the thugs in A Clockwork Orange.
1136;He floats through life, which thinks is one big gamble.
1137;He felt Napolean would have made a better subject for the drama!
1138;The very drama that makes the film interesting.
1139;In turn, his eventual fall from grace provides the film with the kind of intense emotion that transcends his humble origins.
1140;With the superb camera work, marvelous period settings, breathtaking scenery and costumes, and music of the period, the viewer is transfixed, given a glimpse into the excesses of the 18th century in a way that no film since has been able to do.
1141;There's always been something of a fuddle about this movie.
1142;anyone who's read European literature from the mid.18th century, or tried to imagine what it might have been like to live back then, could only love this movie.
1143;so do yourself a favor.
1144;You'll get an idea of what life was like in Europe almost 300 years ago, and you'll be able to savor the gem this movie is.
1145;It's an excellent time machine.
1146;The highly interesting first half, which details Barry Lyndons experiences and encounters when travelling Europe, does make the second part (where he settles) seem slightly less interesting and disrupts the overall momentum a little but the cinematography is nevertheless perfect all the way through and is enough alone to maintain interest.
1147;it won four Academy Awards and very rightly so.
1148;The outdoor settings are breathing and the indoor scenes takes ones breath away with their magnificence and authenticity.
1149;The grace in the movie is that the story is much better than the acting of O'Neal.
1150;up between comic and dramatic.
1151;"especially the part when he ""beats up"" on a much heavier and savvy soldier in a bare."
1152;A bit slow for some, it is Thackery, but I really enjoyed it.
1153;I will always remember the candle scene and the ending.
1154;the strong point of the film is the photography.
1155;The sets, the costumes are all great.
1156;It is hard to work up any enthusiasm for the hero as he is such a groveller to the upper class.
1157;Before there were the Coen Brothers, there was Stanley Kubrick, the icy titan of cool cinema.
1158;He wants flesh he can xray.
1159;The two pieces everyone wants to find are the Sarabande by Handel and a Piano Trio by Schubert (I think, perhaps, #1).
1160;Wow, what a spectacular film!
1161;done, especially with regards to costuming, location, and casting.
1162;a nice departure from most historical adventure films.
1163;A real masterpiece, this film is.
1164;This is a technical masterpiece as only Kubrick can make.
1165;The techniques that were developed for this film made remarkable changes to the movie industry.
1166;The problem is that while stunning, these innovations are now commonplace and while beautifully crafted, the film falls back on the story line.
1167;"I have a few other contenders in my mind, but ""Barry Lyndon"" continues to grow more and more in my affection and incredulity."
1168;"In ""Barry Lyndon,"" the chastened Kubrick comes roaring back from those two disappointments in all his strength and artistic genius."
1169;Every moment is fraught with the crispness of life moving forward and the irony of human ambition.
1170;and that's what the eye does with this movie, it looks with Kubrick, and listens with Kubrick, and delights with the master in the presence of his masterpiece.
1171;The cinematography and period reconstruction is pure eye candy.
1172;And the musical score is pure eloquence, enrapturing as it is instructive.
1173;The whole movie is the finest minuet moving forward and you only need grasp it's hand and pull it to you and move with it in it's rythm.
1174;It is some of the most richly rewarding cinema you will ever experience if you allow it to be what it is.
1175;kubrick the master, at the pinnacle of his craft.
1176;"Also adding to the unique atmosphere of this film is the music of the traditional Irish instrumental ensemble ""The Chieftans."""
1177;"I especially love their piece ""Woman of Ireland."
1178;Stanley Kubrick tells a story that seems more deeply personal than those usually chosen by this director.
1179;As the young Irishman makes his way in the world, he finds his way into the heart of a young and wealthy widow.
1180;i saw this movie as a graduate student with my best friend.
1181;We often discussed this movie together.
1182;I believed that Lyndon had become a better person who developed a genuine love for his wife and child, and that he regretted his earlier misdeeds.
1183;I invite you to see this movie and make your own determination!
1184;knowing that he later made 2001 and Clockwork Orange, it is fascinating to see this sumptuous period movie by Kubrick.
1185;Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a spectacle, full of luscious visuals, extraordinary costumes, and a very aggressive underlying theme of cheating, and losing at life.
1186;I will however say what I saw, and that is a movie with Kubrick's visual style stamped on every single shot.
1187;"this starts Barry's long adventure to ""becoming a gentleman""."
1188;He'll finally acquire wealth beyond his wildest dreams when he manages to court Lady Lyndon, after her husband, Sir Lyndon, finally dies from years of crippling disease.
1189;This starts a vengeful relationship between him and his acquired stepson, Lord Bullingdon.
1190;as stated earlier by myself, Barry Lyndon is one of the most expertly shot films I have ever seen.
1191;The visuals alone make this one of the best movies I've ever seen, but it is not at all a perfect movie.
1192;Though he's never really made a film with truly captivating human characters, his stories, and underlying messages have always been the strongest aspects of his films.
1193;Barry is always displayed as being a character that seems to be.
1194;He's actually quite complicated, the only thing he ever shows passion for being the well.
1195;Don't go to a Kubrick film and expect a film that's intended to leave you happy (Even Dr. Strangelove, one of the best comedies of all time, had an ending that made you speculate the future of the human race).
1196;That being said, for people who are fond of period pieces, there are few movies that I've seen that can match the visual style of Kubrick's film.
1197;While watching it you will feel swept away by the Academy Award winning cinematography of John Alcott and the costumes, which also earned one of the films four Academy Awards.
1198;leonard Rosenman's winning score must also be acknowledged, for it also makes this film an attention grabber.
1199;You may enjoy this film, but it seriously depends on how you take in Kubrick's other work.
1200;If time's a problem you can watch this film in intervals, because there are plenty of chances throughout to pause and take a break.
1201;It needs full attention for you to take in its full impact.
1202;not Kubrick's best, but I give it a solid 9 out of 10.
1203;Great story line following the life and exploits of Redman Barry.
1204;without the amazing cinematography, serene settings, masterful costuming, and revolutionary approach to lighting, Barry Lyndon would still be a very good movie.
1205;It is a beautiful stylized act of fictional biography more like a novel than any film of its genre.
1206;Having finally seen the film, I am now curious to read the novel.
1207;hour epic requires a bit of patience but it is worth all the time you will need to watch it.
1208;It is set in beautiful countrysides, with lovely costuming and makeup, as well as fine performances and an appropriate score.
1209;I was expecting wide screen format, but got full screen.
1210;"Misunderstood when it was first released (audiences and critics in the U. s. thought that ""Barry Lyndon"" might be a bit like the ribald ""Tom Jones"" before seeing it rather than a period drama that tried to capture the ""feel"" of 18th century painting), ""Barry Lyndon"" remains a beautifully photographed if slightly static period piece."
1211;So this is OUTSIDE of the director's choice.
1212;It's worth the price to get the best presentation this film has ever had in a home viewing format.
1213;No noticeable DNR, good grain reproduction, and outstanding audio are huge pluses.
1214;You will be elevated from hillbilly boy to the Great Gatsby.
1215;Remember, all men are wise men until they open their mouth, and remove all doubt.
1216;Barry Lyndon defies description in the usual sense that one may describe a film.
1217;"That is, the plot is not succinct
I:8338;1218;n. roll, Kubrick's films are mostly waltzes.
I:8338;1219;If you come to this film expecting a patient, moving, wonderfully detailed painterly film with a fantastic score, you will enjoy it immensely.
I:8338;1220;This is the difinitive example of film as art.
I:8338;1221;A great tale of rags to riches to rags.
I:8338;1222;A great pick for this Kubrick fan.
I:8338;1223;A technological tour de force, no less than every film to come before from Stanley Kubrick.
I:8338;1224;But this one has a sense of """"no urgency"""" (as opposed to """"no sense of urgency"""") and it's easy to see Kubrick looking back for a moment and breathing a sigh of relief ."""
1225;indulgent time to make love to his cameras again, coaxing them to do things they had never been intended for.
1226;this was good time for Stanley, and he shows it.
1227;Watching BARRY LYNDON reminds me of reading those long epic novels in English Lit.
1228;paced, long and detailed directing method, I found this film to be perfectly paced and quite rewarding.
1229;Part of Kubrick's genius and the finely understated acting of Ryan O'Neal is how we feel sorry for Redmond at the start of the film, but loathe him by the end.
1230;The sound is no better.
1231;critics and fans often marvel at Stanley Kubrick's versatility .
1232;As fans would wonder what a Stanley Kubrick costume drama would look like, so did he.
1233;deeply pessimistic, Barry Lyndon is full of the usual Kubrick satire and sardonic wit.
1234;But O'Neil had the right qualities .
1235;Here Kubrick's immense skill as a film.
1236;isms that Kubrick had fun with earlier serve as the bars of Barry's opulent cage .
1237;and the genuinely tragic instruments of his fall from grace.
1238;Barry Lyndon has gone from icily observant to emotionally shattering in just over three hours.
1239;if you have the patience, it's a journey worth taking.
1240;This is a classic, it's a great classic, you should watch this.
1241;The camera as always in Kubricks films is a wonderful vista on the world, though, in this film due to the AMAZING costumes, sets and acting, it surpasses in my estimation any of his other films.
1242;I particularly enjoyed the candle lit scenes which I have never seen in any other film (for which he had special lens developed for the low light atmosphere and used an extreme amount of candles for).
1243;This is the most underviewed yet of his films.
1244;Yet in my estimation is the best.
1245;Truly wonderful and thought provoking.
1246;The only negative in the film is the length, a common issue in his films, though I enjoy longer films that continue to develop the story.
1247;The finally is a must see.
1248;Beautifully filmed and with a score featuring Schubert's piano trio in E flat and Vivaldi's cello concerto in E minor, the film is slowly paced to reflect the pace of life of the era depicted.
