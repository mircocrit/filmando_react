1;oh and by the way, for everyone out there who wants to see female nudity in this film, you'll see more male flesh.
2;The beginning of Tomcats isn't spectacularly funny but once we see the characters get past the first wedding, the film really starts to pick up and starts to get a lot funnier.
3;If you're into movies along the lines of Say It Isn't So or Saving Silverman then I think you'll enjoy this movie.
4;i would definitly recommend this movie for a good laugh, just don't try to watch it seriously.
5;I personally make all my family watch it.
6;I've always loved it and wanted it as part of our movie collection
7;That tells you right there how disorganized everything is.
8;And because he's a man, of course he jumps right in.
9;Leave it alone and go do something more fun, like your laundry.
10;a hilariously and wickedly mean spirited flick about bachelorism from Hollywood's comical point of view.
11;tomcats is satirical and purely entertaining despite the gross out testicle scene, sperm bank scene, and well, just abut any other scene.
12;Story or plot is simple and basic with a great abundance of feminine eye candy as well (Jaime Pressly and Shannon Elizabeth, and the gal who played Consuelo the maid).
13;Even though Jerry O' Connell is no Brendan Fraser or Tom Hanks the guy is actually capable of being funny !
14;if there's anything the viewer should walk away with it should be a good tickle in the funny bone !
15;IT was funny most throughout the movie, although shannon elizabeth drives me nuts in that movie.
16;But its good, its worth watching it once.
17;I have seen Tomcats dozens and dozens of times now, and I still laugh all the way through the movie.
18;It's raunchy, tacky and juvenile, and one of the greatest comedies of our generation.
19;Now for those of us that know about out of control hormones aka raging hormones, both male and female alike may find this funny.
20;This actually fairly funny either for the young or old if you had a time in you life when you were a little out of control.
21;This movie had some clever writing, directing, casting, acting, stunts, and music.
22;I highly recommend it to the non.
23;Better just watch American Pie.
24;throughout the entire film, many hillarious situatuions and scenes occur during the film.
25;All the acting is surprisingly good, especially from Busey and O'Connel.
26;And I'm here to tell you people, as an uncultured teenage male of the American Pie generation, that TOMCATS is supremely UNFUNNY.
27;tOMCATS and FREDDY GOT FINGERED together in the same season is a one.
28;I watch a lot of movies and I think I'm pretty levelheaded when I say something about a movie.
29;Finally it is down to O'Connell, an artist with some scruples, and his friend Kyle who has none.
30;It was entertaining from start to finish, and lately, I find myself hitting the fast forward on many movies just to get through them.
31;There are more laughs and plain old feel good fun here than most comedies I have seen in awhile.
32;i love this movie and so does my husband.
33;it has romance and over the top humor.
34;yes you definently have to have an open mind to watch this outrageos movie.
35;There are funny Scenes, and there are not so much funny scenes.
36;Definently the star of the screen was Shannon Eliziabeth, with her dashing looks and big brown eyes.
37;overall a funny little movie.
38;A group of male pals are at the wedding of a friend.
39;He's a innocent as can be.
40;Horatio Sanz (NBC's Saturday Night Live) is hilarious and a delight in this film.
41;I can guarantee you there will soon be a barrage of 1.
42;star reviews coming for this movie.
43;gags and numerous sexual references.
44;Jerry O'Connell is great in this movie and Shannon Elizabeth is fairly good also (though I don't think she is that great of an actress).
45;I think it was cast pretty well and everyone played their roles well, I couldn't help but root for the good guys to prevail in the end.
46;the underlying story really isn't that bad either and it does have a fairly good message to it.
47;This is definately not the worst movie, but I still say that the funniest movie still goes to Scary Movie .
48;But yes this is funny and I do recommend it.
49;But I think it's worth viewing.
50;not very funny pretty disgusting thoiugh.
51;This is probably one of my favorite movies.
52;Jerry O'Connell and Shannon Elizabeth do a great job.
53;This 2001 sex comedy delivers the goods.
54;It is very funny especially with its gross out humor bits.
55;You will laugh from beginning to end.
56;The acting in the movie is pretty good.
57;And the beautiful Shannon Elizabeth looks so hot as she usually does.
58;This movie is great fun and will have you wanting more.
59;Absolutely hilarious and sexy comedy!
60;Not a movie with rave reviews but the plot and acting is good.
61;Not an academy award winner, but still worth your time.
62;I think it will be good.
63;Shannon Elizabeth is stunningly beautiful and O'Connel is hilarious 5 out of 5.
64;The Playboys go through some funny situations before the appreciate the comfort of having a relationship.
65;Horatio Sanz got me to crack a smile a couple times, but I can't believe I think he should have been in the movie more.
66;SNL is gold compared to this.
67;I'll recommend this to all the twisted people out there
68;If you like a great comedy film, you will absolutely fall in love with this film and you may even want to make sweet, passionate love to it.
69;Meanwhile, Horatio Sans, the BIGGEST and best star in this film, has suspicisions about his wife being a lesbian and is repeatedly trying to catch her in the act.
70;"Its almost as breathtaking as seeing Chuck Norris as a sorest spirit in ""Forest Warrior""."
71;all in all, this is one of the greatest movies of the year and should win many many awards.
72;"And make sure that's the right kind of ""NUT"" you're eating!"
73;I own it and rewatch it at times.
74;The who gets married last ton tine is a clever ploy and sets up the whole movie.
75;Shannon Elizabeth is worth watching as she gets even with Busey.
76;In the end I think it was the love story between Michael and Natalie that saved this movie for me.
77;Enough of the jokes hit home for me that I found the entire movie funny.
78;The movie would be better with a few beers to help it along while you watch it.
79;It does have a plot and the love story redeems it from being put into the same class as Saving Silverman and Dude Where's My Car both of which I despised.
80;This is my favorite movie of all time.
81;Seven years ago Micheal's friend got married.
82;He goes to Kyle, who is rich, and about to ask him if he can borrow the money.
83;He explained that he thought she was the one who got away.
84;She does but she doesnt remember the way Kyle did.
85;She hates Kyle so shes makes a deal with Michael that for half the bet she will get Kyle to marry her.
86;this movie is hilarious and has a lot of sick and perverted twists throughout it.
87;If you loved American Pie this is perfect for you.
88;there are loads of beautiful fiancees around to tempt the guys to lose their bachelorhoods.
89;if you can laugh and kringe at the same time you are in foran enjoyable 85 minutes.
90;color movie that more than easily earns its R rating.
91;It's a sexual comedy, revolving around a bet a number of unmarried men make as to which one of them will be the last to remain single.
92;It is also offered in two languages, English and French.
93;The movie itself is unforgettable, simply for several of its disgusting sequences.
94;I enjoy movies where the cast had a great time shooting as well.
95;A pretty good storyline features a host of hilarious moments .
96;chasing the testical, throwing the dice, and well, I have to say it .
97;this is hilariously funny (maybe to the point of disgusting?)
98;and of course the 'pretty' funny bachelors party scene .
99;also deserves a mention!This is one of the best comedies I have seen in ages and ages, and for all you girls out there, this is not only for the guys!
100;and you should sit back and enjoy the ride!
101;top as American Pie 2, it does rank right up there.
102;All editorial and press reviews aside, this was a very good movie.
103;See this movie if you're a fan of gross.
104;Imbecilic jokes abound to entertaining the male masses who must make up the majority of this film's viewers.
105;If you want to see a brilliant dissertation of human depravity, check it out.
106;"Her best role was in ""American Pie."""
107;bucks and I've watched it twice since.
108;I'm still laughing at it.
109;Definitely worth it if you're a guy between 18.100 years old.
