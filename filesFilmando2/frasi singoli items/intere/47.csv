1;This Is Spinal Tap is a fun satire.
2;It is as obvious as it is freewheeling, but it hits its bullseye and never stops.
3;The disparity between the interviews and the behind the scenes debacles is telling.
4;Mercilessly, the contradictions poke fun at the pretenses and the self.
5;importance of a successful band hitting the skids.
6;"The songs, especially the lyrics, nail the music on its head. """
7;This Is Spinal Tap is an infectious parody of heavy metal bands and a fun movie that makes it all seem so easy.
8;Not only is it funny but they have some decent orignal music to go with it!
9;Well A Viewer thinks Blair Witch was scary, and Anime is an art form !
10;if you are a rock musician ( I know some people feel those two words don't go together ) , you will love it.
11;it is a great creative endeavour and says as much about the dynamics of relationships as it does about being in a band , which is a special feeling .
12;I've finally seen this for the first time in 2008, and I'm 44 years old, making me a contemporary of Harry Shearer or something.
13;Wow, talk about being behind the times.
14;I enjoyed the music, too, which was unexpected, really.
15;I also love rock music, and all the associated trappings.
16;I love cleverly done satire.
17;now, combine those two things I love (rock and satire), do it well, and you have one of the best.
18;just so they can see how utterly self.
19;Maybe if they see this film, their sides will split open from laughter, and their oversized egos will deflate.
20;"on Amazon's scale of 1 to 5, I give ""This Is Spinal Tap"" an 11."
21;needed continuation of the story, with some hilarious moments resembling Mystery Science Theater 3000.
22;You can tell they were just winging it, and it doesn't give a complete update on the bad, which i would have liked, but it's great nonetheless.
23;An included interview with Dibergo is also funny and informative, but the audio commentary is better.
24;up option would be cool too, and much more fun than the above.
25;It's silly, weird and smart in its humor, and it's really the standard by which all mocumentaries should be judged by.
26;A true classic every comedy fan should own.
27;Rob Reiner, along with the men of Tap, have created a masterpiece of rock and roll humor.
28;Incredibly funny, the story of the Smell the Glove tour by the aging rock band Spinal Tap pokes fun at all the prior rockumentaries , while providing some suprisingly decent music too.
29;interviews with the band, live concert footage, flashbacks and behind the scenes of a working rock band, this movie has it all, and it is all funny.
30;This is a brilliantly witty take on those way too serious rock bands who think that we really need to know all about them.
31;i hesitate to call the movie well written, as I understand there was quite a bit of ad.
32;Nonetheless, the actors do a great job of bring to life the characters that make up one of the loudest rock bands of all time.
33;plus, from Come on, Mime is money to This one goes to eleven , this movie is full of great movie lines that you will be quoting to friends for years to come.
34;Turn the volume up to 11 and enjoy
35;Spinal Tap is one of the most clever, incisive satires ever made.
36;all created the mockumentary genre with this film and it's influence and relevance today is as strong as ever.
37;there is so much to this film that a review of a few hundred words can't possibly due it justice.
38;up, they expressed a remarkable degree of loyalty for a band they only heard about in the last 24 hours.
39;I've seem Spinal Tap at least 8 times and each time I catch something new.
40;what's remarkable about Spinal Tap is it's accuracy and insightfulness.
41;This can best be illustrated by the reaction of Steven Tyler to this film (I'm not an Aerosmith fan, but it's a good story).
42;spinal Tap is as fresh today as it was 16 years ago.
43;Some people love it, while others don't find it funny at all.
44;Also, a good historical understanding of popular music and the machinery of the music industry is necessary to understand some or the humor.
45;The movie is shot like a featurette with a director interviewing the band members and following them around as they tour.
46;It also shows the ups and downs of being a rock group.
47;One minute they would be on top with stadiums packed with 5,000 audience members.
48;It's funny because it attempts to be serious.
49;(I think this film was fun to watch.
50;With its witty humour and memorable quotes and scenes, you'll definitely want to watch the movie again, the next day!
51;Its well worth the watch, with some great quotes.
52;The running commentary and deleted footage are as funny as the movie itself.
53;I forgot what a great movie this was until viewing it again as an adult.
54;Even our 16 year old found it entertaining.
55;There are a ton of cameos in this movie from stars just getting their start from the period.
56;'How can I leave this behind' from Big Bottomed Girls is one of the most clever lines ever.
57;This movie gets funnier with each viewing!
58;I enjoyed this for multiple reasons:1.
59;The movie is just as good, but the ton of extras in this version are amazing.
60;For instance, the section about the opening act is hilarious.
61;The commentary was actually serious, as the special edition has the guys back in character, which is just as funny.
62;But it was interesting o get the real scoop on how it was made, as this is an interesting process since there was a lot of ad libbing.
63;And, since it such an interesting movie that people will actually like, Criterion, of course, no longer has it available.
64;All none of heir great films.
65;It is actually quite a genius style of comedy that is presented in a documentary format which is completely improvised.
66;"I love ""This is Spinal Tap""."
67;is hilarious, as a movie the film has a serious flaw.
68;It's are not going anywhere (Japan is not counting), it's more a series of funny sketches and songs.
69;having said that, there are many many good things in this film.
70;The band actually appreciates that review.
71;great lyrics to all the songs, too.
72;Great parts that are larger than the whole.
73;The costumes diffidently have not timed well and they should have hired some to write titles for the sound but then the music is fantastic.
74;A brilliant comedy by the master of subtle and accurate comedy.
75;This is Spinal Tap is truly ingenious(brilliant).
76;If you want to watch this out of the corner of your eye while you're cleaning.you are not going to enjoy this movie, IF you do actually concentrate on the film you will see some absolutely hilarious, often tongue.
77;among many other hilarious bits.
78;"the artists most successfully lampoon ""England's Loudest Band""."
79;iF, you ARE aware of Rock and Roll and its' musicians.
80;this movie will hit the mark!
81;This is a great movie mocking the music industry.
82;stage mishaps are extremely funny, probably more so than usual because it is easy to forget it is just a movie.
83;Besides their concert mistakes, the characters themselves are extremely entertaining and convincing.
84;Not only are the actors convincing, but they are talented.
85;They have good voices and although I am not a fan of that type of music it is still kind of catchy.
86;This movie is worthwhile to see.
87;Great for Friday night movie!
88;The first in a number of great Christopher Guest comedies.
89;The humor is so subtle that you really have to get it when it comes to his movies.
90;Full of subtle dry humor following a washed up 70/80's hair band.
91;This is a classic that you falls into the must see category.
92;"Last night, I finally got around to watching this so called ""funniest movie ever made about rock and roll"" (as the back cover states proudly)."
93;this, is bar none, one of the funniest movies ever made.
94;"Through interviews, backstage footage and lots of music, such as big Tap hits like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm"", you will learn everything you need to know about this great classic rock band."
95;this brand new special edition is loaded with great bonus features, none of which I watched yet.
96;(It'll be a while before I get a chance, because I got a lot of Christmas gifts).
97;But the most special feature of them all is the movie itself.
98;This movie has 4.5 very clever, very humorous scenes.
99;For that alone, it was worth the .
100;as I said above, the film had a few nice moments.
101;Guffman is more sophisticated, more clever, and much more taut as a comedy.
102;All 3 lead actors do a competent job, the directing is nice, but the film is short on content.
103;if you're dying to see a good American comedy film check out Rushmore, Happiness, Waiting for Guffman, etc.
104;i did and I got burned.
105;All the sounds, all the smells, are there for you to enjoy.
106;It is a brilliant look at what passed for rock n roll, circa 1984, without being condescending.
107;This is a film a fan of heavy metal could enjoy equally as much as someone who felt that this was just a passing fad.
108;"the disc is great because you also get a great (albeit short) introduction by Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner, completly in character), as well as great trailers for the film (lookout for the ""cheese festival"" bit."
109;Plus, all the music videos shot for the film, and a very funny TV appearence (from the Joe Franklin Show, who doesn't seem to be in on the joke).
110;If you can make farther than me good for you!
111;Yes it was funny and yes the songs made me laugh.
112;I literally unwrapped it in front of my class, popped it into the player and it was freezing up and pixelated.
113;My students loved it, and the movie is good enough and detailed enough, I didn't mind watching it with the three sections I teach.
114;Rarely do I come across a movie as funny and original as This Is Spinal Tap.
115;Ed Begley Jr is an absolute genius.
116;His unique method of creating this fictional documentary .
117;rockumentary that contains hilariously realistic interviews, is truly one of the kind.
118;Along with Guest, all of the other characters are equally great to watch, and of course the outrageous hairstyles and skintight costumes make a huge plus.
119;Spinal Tap's depiction of typical 80's British rock bands also comes off as quite accurate, and the film enables audiences to take a look at the peculiar but funny culture of hard.
120;Cleverly spontaneous and quirky, This Is Spinal Tap is definitely a classic.
121;It is loaded full of scenes deleted from the original film, (and many are hilarious) and many of these deleted scenes lend credence to some of the storylines in the theatre version.
122;Diehard Tap fans will find this absolutely hilarious and very informative!
123;Special Edition , you get so much more, and you'll love it!
124;Certainly not our favorite movie by any measure.
125;When first delving into the world of heavy metal, my friend Matt (a. k. a. tkdmateo) informed me of this film, a funny rockumentary about a fictitious group called Spinal Tap.
126;this is one of those films where it's hilarious and sadly true simultaneously.
127;Rob Reiner, acclaimed director of Stand By Me and A Few Good Men, also co. wrote the script (or improvisations, as most of the film was) with Shearer, Guest, and McKean, and he also hosts the film as Marty DiBergi.
128;He keeps the film satirical and hilarious, while also keeping the characters straight.
129;the music is performed by all the actors, believe it or not, and the songs are often well.
130;constructed and catchy, while also sporting some hilarious lyrics.
131;it's all played very well, and it features a few actors that come in as surprising cameos including Ed Begley, Jr., Patrick Macnee, Howard Hessman, and Billy Crystal (who happens to be a good friend of Mr. Reiner), among many others.
132;A revolutionary film, both for those who love rock n' roll and of improvisational comedy.
133;This, my friends, is a classic masterpiece that fits in perfectly, whatever your collection is.
134;This film is truly one of a kind.
135;It perfectly lampoons the life, success, and downfall of a rock group.
136;The film is shot as a documentary, or as this kind of film is, a 'mockumentary'.
137;The members of this band include David St. Hubbins(the always great Michael McKean), who is the vocalist of the group.
138;Nigel Tufnel(the brilliant Christopher Guest), is the lead guitarist.
139;Big mustached Derek Smalls(the great Harry Shearer), is the bass player.
140;"They turned into a long haired, heavy metal group with songs like ""Big Bottom"", ""Sex Farm"", and others."
141;The inner turmoil within the band is showcased as well.
142;Throughout the film and interviews, there are concert clips showing the band in glorious action.
143;Fred Willard and Ed Begley Jr., who have become Chris Guest regulars in his future films, appear here as well.
144;Willard, as he will in the future films, steals every single frame he is in.
145;It's a type of comedy that is very dry, but also very funny.
146;There is a new interview with Rob Reiner.
147;There is a slew of other special features here.
148;It's a hysterical film that hits on every mark.
149;Definitley the funniest movie about music ever made, and the all time best 'mockumentary'.
150;Go ahead and see this.
151;It's one of a kind.
152;The movie set the stage for others to come later but remember to turn the volume up to 11.
153;Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap, the funniest film ever made, was the first official mockumentary from writer.
154;star Christopher Guest, who later released Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and the absolutely brilliant Waiting for Guffman.
155;It's clever, silly and highly quotable, the kind of movie you and your friends will quote back and forth to one another years after watching it.
156;and the performance of Stonehenge is, hands down, the funniest moment I've ever seen in a film.
157;this is an absolutely fantastic film.
158;perfect gift for someone getting to know spinal tap and thier sights smells and sounds.
159;Very, very funny and well done!
160;This is one of the best spoof movies around.
161;Several of the best videos were included on the 1992 VHS release.
162;What IS included is great!
163;Although several bits I feel could've stayed in, you'll agree that they used the best stuff for the final film.
164;The new lead guitar player was a very interesting idea.
165;This is an amazing film in many ways: (1) presenting this fictional Rock group `Spinal Tap' in a charismatically buffoonish, but at the same time completely believable `reality TV' kind of way = Long before reality TV even existed, circa1983!
166;(2) The performances from Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer seem so earnest and sincere .
167;up of three very skilled Actors?!
168;as talented as `KISS' even in the fine Art of `tongue' gymnastics!)
169;god Carl), really deserves much of the credit .
170;and it was the start of his most brilliant career!Final word = this is a highly original film, and one of the earliest and most successful `mockumentaries' (Albert Brooks might have started the Trend, in the 1970's).
171;The only other one that I remember enjoying anywhere near as much (and directed by one of those unhinged `spinal' columns himself, Christopher Guest), the almost equally insanely hilarious movie called `Best in Show' circa 1998 (Dog lovers take heed .
172;Everytime I watch this, I catch something new.
173;Great lines and great moments.
174;Every rock and roll fan must see it.
175;So close to reality with a lot of bands that you think it is real.
176;"are the subjects of the first and still the best mock/rockumentary ""This Is Spinal Tap"" (a film by Marty Dibergi/Rob Reiner)."
177;"deep inside Tap's history, exploring the lean years (""Gimmie Some Money""), the innocent years (""Cups and Cakes""), the psychedelic years (""(Listen to the) Flower People""), the monolith years (""Stonehenge"") and the then."
178;It's like, how much more black could this be?
179;Tufnel, in particular, is driven with a desire to always go one louder, with his amplifyer, his solos, and his backstage culinary demands.
180;"I for one was particularly moved when Nige tells David, ""do a good show,a'right?"""
181;I found Tap to be a moving tribute to near.
182;If you are a rock fan and you have a good sense of humor, then this is the ultimate.
183;A seering exploration of life behind the glitz and glamour of rock and roll?
184;released in '84 'This Is Spinal Tap' is a cult classic amongst those who are in a band, or have ever been in one.
185;There's enough funny material, like the Stonghenge bit, for all of us to enjoy!
186;There's such a fine line between clever and .
187;flaps, my girls got 'em).
188;As I nodded of I woke with a start .
189;This is Spinal Tap is the brilliant rockumentary/mockumentary chronicling the band Spinal Tap's tour of the United States.
190;This is Spinal Tap remains somewhat of a cult classic, but its hilarious characters, awesome music, and brilliant storyline comes to life on screen, and everyone could enjoy this movie.
191;A young Christopher Guest plays Nigel with a quiet brilliance, and Guest would incidentally go on to direct and star in two of his own mockumentary films, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and BEST IN SHOW, which I must say, are equally genius, especially the recent sleeper hit BEST IN SHOW.
192;Also great is Tony Hendra, as the cricket.
193;June Chadwick is strong as David's girlfriend Jeannine, and Bruno Kirby makes a great cameo as the limo driver.
194;The other supporting cameos are fantastic, coming from Fred Willard(who won a Best Supporting Actor award from the LA Critics for his role in BEST IN SHOW), Dana Carvey, Billy Crystal, Fran Drescher, Angelica Huston, and Paul Shaffer.
195;This utterly hilarious movie is excellently directed by Reiner, who plays the director of the mockumentary within the film, Marty Dibergi!
196;Really enjoyed catching up and seeing ST again.
197;Kids also saw it for the first time and are now hooked.
198;And seems very true to most rock bands' routines during the eighties.
199;Despite the lack of creativity with screenplay, Reiner (the director) does a good job with the actors and camera work.
200;And just maybe, the actors' phenomenal performances during this flick are what ultimately saves this from being a flop.
201;This is Spinal Tap has the distinction of being the funniest rockumentary ever created.
202;In addition there are many cameos by some of Hollywoods funniest stars.
203;"In addition to a new digital transfer of the film we get the presentation in Dolby 5.1 which adds a lot to the ""heavy metal"" concert footage."
204;this is one that is worth checking out.
205;This has to be one of the funniest films ever made.
206;Obviously, the music is the funniest element of the film.
207;"some of the best moments of this film (in my opinion) are:~the ""free."
208;My favorite track is Big Bottom obviously making fun of AC\DC's Big Balls.
209;The transfer is excellent, especially the clarity of the on.
210;It adds another humorous element to an already funny movie.
211;This one is definitely a keeper!
212;But do you remember back in junior high, when the teacher made you write essay after essay, and you just rolled your eyes and groaned?
213;"With regards to ""compare and contrast,"" I wrote a ""Carrie"" versus ""Case 39"" review recently."
214;Personally, I liked the latter more than the former .
215;"I did find a couple of reviews around the web from true horror afficianados who seem to agree with me
216;fest of a metal band .
217;And that reminds me of another """"music"""" film: """"One Direction: This is Us."""""""
218;"I highly recommend reading Grammar Girl's musings on these issues
219;me)Now, the actors in """"Spinal Tap"""" ."""
220;While this film has fun with the characters, it really never makes fun of them per se.
221;Even the audience will laugh, but they still find these characters oddly charming and mostly sympathetic.
222;But most important: this film is clever while doing it.
223;"Now, if you watch ""Glee,"" the singers on that very funny TV show do covers of rock songs ."
224;i could go on all day, but I hope that you see my point.
225;"But maybe you should thank those teachers now, since they gave you a skill, a skill that allows you to give evidence that ""Spinal Tap"" is ""pure awesomeness"" (as Jack Black might say), while ""Metallica: Into the Never"" and ""One Direction: This is Us"" not only have possible English issues with regards to their titles, but are also possibly uninteresting films."
226;I am a huge Tap fan, and when I heard that the Blu.
227;So, about 30 minutes of poor extra material is dropped onto an extra disc, to give you the impression that this is special material.
228;documentary holds fascination for so many people, and why not?
229;and the results are still as funny as they were when the movie came out in the early 80s.
230;"All this, and some very funny songs like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm Woman"" are merely the icing on the cake as a washed."
231;Full of goofy clothes that hit too close to home, outrageous dialogue, and an inevitable reunion, this movie is nonstop fun for the rocker in us all.
232;One of my favorite movies of all time showing the hard ships of being in a heavy metal band during the 80s.
233;Singer/guitarist David St. Hubbins is one of the greatest singers in metal history, I put him up there with Quiet Riot's Kevin DuBrow and Mark Slaughter plus St. Hubbins kind of reminds me of that dude that played Lenny on Laverne and Shirley.
234;My husband, who has never been a rock music fan, thought for awhile that this movie was a real documentary of a rock music band.
235;You know that satire is great when it is rocketing along that close to the truth!
236;Rob Reiner, director of this masterpiece, goes beyond tongue.
237;cheek, to present the funniest, wickedest satire of a rock music band and the music industry itself.
238;This film deserves a prominent spot in everyone's permanent film collection.
239;My husband is inordinately amused by this movie, but on second, third, and yes, even fourth viewing .
240;I've decided he's right: it's one of the silliest, funniest movies ever made.
241;The first of the hilarious Christopher Guest movies, this one chronicles Spinal Tap in the most over the top way.
242;It's amazing how all the actors can keep a straight face while saying the most ridiculous things and wearing such amazing 80s clothes.
243;Do yourself a favor and watch this one if you're into dry but witty humor.
244;Watching the deleted scenes is like watching a whole new movie in itself.
245;It's not a gripping life altering film by any stretch, but it is an amusing concept that deserves merit for for creativity.
246;If youv'e got some, it's worth the time.
247;A great spoof on rock bands of the day.
248;Rob rieiner did a great job on this movie.
249;"A movie that had me laughing throughout
250;But seriously, this movie was great.
251;At Ferncliff Hall we don't often view good movies, but this was a refreshing exception.
252;Thank you very much it is one of my favorites!
253;One of the funniest movies ever made, and arguably the best Mocu.
254;The music's so right on that people clamored for albums from them.
255;Pure comical genius with subtle satire.
256;One good quote, we had all of our equipment modified to go to 11 .
257;And this very special edition delivers the goods.
258;It is hilarious and an excellent companion to a film that needs nothing to help it earn its place as a comedy classic.Yes, Spinal Tap, the first true mockumentary is a wonderful piece of filmmaking.
259;It is funny and it ROCKS.
260;if you have never seen this film, pick it up right away.
261;This version is worth it, and the price is extra nice.
262;It's rare for me to outright keep loving comedies.
263;Somehow though, this film manages to be funny even if you've seen it several times.
264;Staged as a """"rockumentary"""" about a fictional band, the film manages to be hilarious, filled with good drama and even some social commentary."""
265;This is probably Rob Reiner's finest and just one of comedy's better film outings.
266;there's so many classic moments that it's hard to pinpoint the most hilarious.
267;The film was largely improv'd and it allows the film to have a more brisker pacing and jokes come easier rather than peppering the film with comedic moments at certain points.
268;"the highlight of the special features is the ""band commentary"" where actors Michael McKean(David), Christopher Guest(Nigel) and Harry Shearer(Derek) supply commentary in character about the film."
269;While it does get old since they essentially derail everything in the film but some is just hilarious.
270;"up menu before the film logo where one says of a black screen ""it's like space without the stars"" and the other goes ""that's really quite poetic, man""."
271;"whereas the Princess Bride was more whimsical and even ""magical"", Spinal Tap is just simply funny and even insightful."
272;This is Spinal Tap is, inarguably, a classic comedy.
273;This one definitely deserves a second look, if not only for the classic scenes (Stonehedge, the airport metal detector, Puppet Show and Spinal Tap.)
274;Just thinking of some of the great quotes from this masterpiece makes me LOL!!
275;I watch this every few years, and am still amused by the jokes.
276;If you were a headbanger in the 70's, you'll be able to relate to much of this movie.
277;Say a prayer to St. Hubbins and enjoy.
278;Easily my favorite movie of all time.
279;the great thing about Tap is that the actors never jab you in the ribs and laugh at the characters along with you .
280;"style novelty items
281;Those things are funniest which come nearest their intended targets, and Tap is consistently dead.
282;It is a brilliant skewering of rock and roll, executed with the perfect blend of creativity, insanity, and restraint.
283;have particularly for musicians and music fans.
284;Songs written and performed by Michael McKeon, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer .
285;british accents spot on .
286;This Is Spinal Tap is a movie that treads this fine line and is almost always on the clever side.
287;A mock rockumentary, with Rob Reiner as the director (of both the rockumentary and the real movie), this film is a romp through the world of heavy metal music, and is very funny as well.
288;The fun is in the dialogue .
289;Similarly, there's great fun involved in the concert numbers, with such notable tunes as Big Bottom, Sex Farm, and Hell Hole.
290;they really play the instruments and sing the songs, and keep their parts distinct and self.
291;That all the parts are played with such utter seriousness and sincerity only increases the hilarity.
292;There is an hour of extra footage cut from the movie.
293;There's also 4 music videos, 3 of which are just the full versions of songs that were truncated in the film, but fun to watch nonetheless.
294;There are assorted other interviews and comments, and a full audio commentary of the 3 main characters (in character), which is quite amusing.
295;clearly, a lot of effort went into making this film, and the proof is up there on the screen .
296;it's a fun film, with enough nuances that it can be watched over and over again.
297;I loved this movie when I first saw it twenty years ago.
298;I have seen it a number of times since then and I have laughed so hard every time.
299;The story of a sixties flower power band turned heavy metal in the eighties still holds its own in the 00's.
300;The performances by the stars.you really believe that they are these singers.
301;Plus you get to see a young Fran Drescher (pre Nanny) and Billy Crystal (pre When Harry Met Sally) in small but very funny parts.
302;is every bit as funny as the movie itself.
303;Its hilarious band members and side.
304;This is my favorite movie and I recommend it to any fan of heavy metal (and Christopher Guest fans will definitely love it!!!)
305;Rob Reiner (and company) have created a timeless classic.
306;She thought it was hilarious.
307;something at a school loaded with music and liberal arts types that thought it was beyond hilarious.
308;This movie is kind of like the much more recent Zoolander.
309;This is the classic rock and roll mockumentary video.
310;Fun, funny, even after all these years it holds its value
311;This is the funniest movie ever made, without question.
312;It is a massively popular cult classic for a reason.
313;The acting is so outrageous if keeps me riveted.
314;The more you see it, the funnier it gets.
315;This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
316;Rob Reiner is a genius in having made this flick.
317;The script is great, the humor great, somewhat suttle, and the movie definitely will make you want to watch it more.
318;Of course, the movie This Is Spinal Tap is unbelievably hilarious.
319;The music videos, press conferences, commercials, and other rarities are awesome.
320;While maybe not the funniest film ever made, though you can make a case for it, Spinal Tap is surely the most inventive.
321;Spawning a slew of ripoffs and inspiring some pretty well stylized movies, Bob Roberts and Boogie Nights to name a few, the mockumentary format in the hands of directors less capable than Rob Reiner has been ridden into the ground.
322;Co. written by the cast I image it was as much fun for them to make as it is for us to watch.
323;luck band called, you guested it .
324;splittingly funny songs ever captured on tape and during one performance find themselves playing amdist midgets and an eighteen inch model of Stone Hinge, you've gotta see it to realize how funny it actually is.
325;This is one of the funniest and most clever films ever made.
326;_This is Spinal Tap_ is a very funny, very original comedy that centers on the idea of a fake """"rockumentary"""" of a fading British heavy."""
327;Rob Reiner does a superb job and the film actually feels like a documentary instead of a bunch of sequences designed to entertain.
328;This movie will particularly appeal to musicians (or those that know and love them), though everyone will enjoy the comedy of this waning band being booked second to a puppet show and doing an act with a Stonehenge set, only to have a miniature Stonehenge descend on stage.
329;whether it's Nigel explaining to us that his amps go to 11 or, my personal favorite part, when he starts to solo during a show, using a violin to play his guitar, only to stop and retune the violin, this movie will make you laugh time and time again.
330;It was a glorious time to be a Tapper.
331;It was actually pretty good.
332;"Two years later, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" was released and the band's new album shot to #58 on the Billboard Chart."
333;They'd earned their spot as the 58th most popular heavy metal band that week.
334;It's such a fine line between clever and stupid, as a wise sage once said.
335;This ranks as one of the great satires ever committed to film and one of the funniest comedies ever.
336;There is so much good stuff here that to give away the surprises would be criminal.
337;Kudos to Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer for such an ingenious collaboration.
338;The numerous cameos here (Ed Begley Jr., Billy Crystal, Angelica Huston,etc.) are also a joy to behold.
339;astrologer also make a major contribution to the film.
340;This hilarious parody of the rock scene was so good that it spawned an entire sub.
341;The enthusiasm of the Tap members for being rock stars is so pure and joyful, even after many years and despite the reality of their crumbling tour, that we can't help but wish them well.
342;"When I first saw ""Spinal Tap"" in the theater, I thought it was hilarious."
343;and there ARE some truly hilarious moments, mostly in the live performance segments: Big Bottoms, Stonehenge and the Pod People sequence in particular.
344;It's fun, and a bit of a cultural landmark.
345;This film is a comedy masterpiece for music fans in.
346;But DiBergi really captured the essence of what it is like to be on the road with an ear.
347;appeal, talent and proper hygiene, they made up for with ear.
348;"More than 20 years old now and a little dated, Spinal Tap is still loads of fun with the ""mockumentary"" gang including Christopher Guest and Michael McKean (who did the delightful ""Best in Show"" in 2000)."
349;Every aspect of `60s and `70s rock music is lampooned.
350;but maybe that's just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters.
351;Great idea, amazing writing and stellar acting.
352;I just look at him in this movie and start laughing.
353;highly recommended for baby boomer, rock fans.
354;I have since watched it about six times, and it gets better every time.
355;"Give it a couple changes
356;Christopher Guest is a comic genius.
357;documentary films and you want a starting place, This Is Spinal Tap is where to begin.
358;Every character is strategically placed to spoof a particular element of the rock industry.
359;Spinal Tap is like a perfect, feature length, Saturday Night Live skit.
360;Any fan of this type of comedy, or of Christopher Guest will love this classic film.
361;Also check out Waiting For Guffman, and Best In Show, both by Guest.
362;Great band movie, the slaps hot of music based movies.
363;an all time classic .
364;seven more words required so now I can submit
365;I never saw this when it was new, Just watched it now and it is still hilarious.
366;Now I will understand the references to the movie that come up now and then.
367;It's classic cinema makes it a great movie for its time it's basically about a struggling band that used to be the next big thing
368;This is a great movie and one of the best mockumentrys ever made.
369;Loads of laughs and full of truth.
370;anyone who has been on the road, or in the music industry will appreciate this movie.
371;This movie, unlike, say, The Decline Of Western Civilization, conveys a realistic portrayal of what it's like to be in a working, touring band.
372;at any rate, this film should be required viewing for anyone who thinks they want to be a musician.
373;all of that said, this is a hysterically funny film.
374;Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean are amazingly talented comedians, actors, and songwriters.
375;You'll still be laughing when it's done.
376;Right up front they tell you that Spinal Tap has risen to become of on Britain's LOUDEST bands.
377;I have seen this movie several times and each time it is funnier.
378;Watching this was such blast from the past!
379;I loved the way they lampooned so many bands in this feature.
380;isms, spoofs of other famous songs, excellent caricatures of aging, rock stars who know nothing else, pretty darned amazing.
381;life feel was pretty spot on.
382;Quite a few laughs throughout, because they played the parts so well.
383;Christopher GuestHarry Shearerthat's pretty much all you need to know.
384;ed Begly's cameo is priceless!!
385;It was as funny as the first time.
386;I have since seen about every Christopher Guest film or mockumentary and loved them.
387;is it award caliber, no.
388;Is it entertaining and funny?
389;Better late than never, as they say"
390;and to the delight of the viewer.
391;"top Manchester accents, to ""flashbacks"" depicting the 18."
392;"year history of the band (and its 37 drummers, all victims of bizarre accidents), this ""rockumentary"" is hard core comedic bliss."
393;Yet after the movie's over, it gets even better. . . special features.
394;"This Special Edition includes numerous outtakes (some entertaining, some not so entertaining), some ""music videos"", some ""commercials"", the theatrical trailers, and a special commentary that puts the proverbial cherry on this sundae."
395;overs, from scene to scene, are just as entertaining as the film itself, making THIS IS SPINAL TAP a crowning comedic experience.
396;So we turned it up to 11 and had a rocking good night!
397;Twenty years after its release, This Is Spinal Tap is still in the running for the funniest film ever made.
398;"This astonishingly clever mockumentary directed by Rob Reiner chronicles the ""First Farewell Tour"" of an aging British paleo."
399;"lib performances by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer and dozens of memorable minor characters, Spinal Tap launched an entire subgenre of sophisticated satire (think the ""Simpsons"" or ""Best in Show""), but has never been surpassed."
400;"The score offers such gems as ""Big Bottom"", ""Sex Farm,"" ""Hellhole"" and of course ""Listen to the Flower People""."
401;A co. worker of mine suggested that I watch this movie.
402;(That was over 20 years ago) I finally got around to it because it was offered on Amazon.
403;This is a timeless movie and is as relevant today as it was then.
404;"This first ""mockumentary"" is a treat to watch, chronicling the (invented) adventures of the rock group Spinal Tap, ""Britain's loudest band."
405;Filled with a host of comedic talent, there's much to laugh at in this film, but one of its great strengths (and what sets it apart from the team's later mockumentaries such as Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show) is that it is never too absurd to be believed.
406;The characters in this film are absolutely believable and the situations they get themselves in are, too (like the stage malfunctions, and the cancelled bookings).
407;this is a movie that never gets old, and it's recommended for all fans of comedy and music.
408;It is one of those things that gets better every time you listen to it.
409;The band is made up of very clever comics with the ability to mock various music genres.
410;this movie is a highlight reel!!!
411;Absolutely one of the funniest movies of all time.
412;The first mockumentary may still be the best.
413;"Long before ""A Mighty Wind,"" ""Best In Show,"" and ""Waiting For Guffman,"" Christopher Guest was best known for his work in ""This is Spinal Tap."""
414;"or ""rockumentary,"" if you will, he is brilliant, and wrote this film (along with writing the ORIGINAL rock and roll music) with the wonderful team of Michael Mckean, Harry Shearer and director Rob Reiner."
415;You are going to laugh so hard, as the actors manage to retain their overaccentuated British accents, over.
416;"top rock star eccentricities and belt out songs like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Hell Hole."""
417;I loved this movie when it came out, and I love it more now.
418;I'm continually in awe of the combination of musical and comedic talent on display here by all the performers, but Chris Guest in particular.
419;The new material adds a lot to the enjoyment .
420;But I got it for a b. day gift and the extras are so good I may have to watch it a million more!
421;If you like classic rock you will love this funny ass movie!
422;It is one of the funniest rock movies I have ever seen baby!
423;The funniest movie ever made.
424;Though the format has been best utilized for action and sci.
425;the transfer is exceptionally clear and crisp, with bright, vivid colors and a great sound mix.
426;The extras are quite funny and entertaining .
427;very much worth your time.
428;It's getting a bit dated, but still full of fantastic humor .
429;This is one of the first mockumentaries from this group, but one of the best.
430;The music is both good and pretty funny, as well.
431;This is Spinal Tap has become the quintessential rock'n'roll movie .
432;full of strangely lifelike jokes, gigantic hair, annoying girlfriends, hilarious acting, and a many an exploding drummer from time to time.
433;Is it the end of Spinal Tap?One of the funniest ways make something funny is to stay really, really close to reality .
434;"And sprinkled in between are little interviews between DiBergi and the band, littered with hilarious quotables (""It's like fire and ice, basically."
435;"I feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water"")."
436;in fact, Reiner manages to craft a very believable rock'n'roll world, complete with label controversies, Sinatra.
437;loving chauffeurs, groupies and frequent technical malfunctions.
438;center, but both he's pretty funny too .
439;This is Spinal Tap is the ultimate rock movie .
440;a funny, deadpan, wittily mocking little look at the world's loudest band.
441;I even got to see these guys live on the short but deluxe Break Like The Wind tour.
442;This would have been a perfect release, I hope they consider the over whelming demand and re.
443;I love when people mock the 80's hair bands and stuff like that, so this was definitely a movie for me.
444;Already a classic in the documentary genre.
445;Our amplifier goes to 11).
446;Great ensemble cast went on to do Best in Show and others of that ilk.
447;If you consider it as a movie it is not funny at all, but if you look at it as a rockumentary than it is the funniest thing i ve ever seen.
448;It is a must see for a rock or metal fan.
449;ever since the Beatles came to America almost 40 years ago, pop culture has been fascinated with English rockers.
450;And boy, what a hoot it is.
451;To this day, almost 20 years later, this movie is still very enjoyable, with its satire, silliness, and, actually, realism.
452;Yes, many rock musicians have noted how realistic the movie is.
453;Many of them admitted it on I Love The '80s .
454;star reviews written by rocket scientists who think Spinal Tap was a real band.)
455;the band taking the stage in Cleveland.
456;"This is actually brilliant humour
457;(That's right, that's really Chris Guest doing that solo.)
458;(Lots of cool bonus features too!)
459;Now I'll close this review with a quote from Megadeth's Dave Mustaine: You know a tour's going bad when you start getting flashes in your head of Spinal Tap!
460;But a) it's quite funny, b) the songs distill everything about 60's and 70's music in a way that's hilarious if you lived through those eras and their music, and c) the dynamics of how the band acts and reacts with each other and the music industry are quite recognizable to anybody who's ever been in the industry.
461;Hesitate no further, this is a must.
462;This is one of the funniest movies ever made, with satisfying extras, and needs to be in your collection!
463;Every line in this movie is funny.
464;again, if you're a musician, every line rings true and is funny.
465;The actors nail the whole declining rock group.
466;The song lyrics and musical performances are hilarious, as are the deadpan performances in between shows.
467;My favorite scene: the latest drummer giving his interview in the bathtub, while wearing a shower cap.
468;Funnier every time I watch, and the brilliance of the satire means you keep discovering subtle jokes missed before.
469;If there is a movie worth owning (ok, there are a few) this belongs in that camp.
470;The individual scenes are brilliant comedy .
471;and the director manages to hold them together with a (reasonably) solid story of this band's spiral into obscurity.
472;I bet the out takes are great.
473;These guys are the best at random humor and were doing it before every
474;I know that I write alot of crazy things, but this is the funniest movie of all time.
475;I professional, and I'll rise above it.
476;This is the movie that turned me on to Christopher Guest's unique style of subtle comedy (though This is Spinal Tap is hardly subtle).
477;i recommend this movie to pretty much everyone who has an interest in music (especially the music of the 60's, 70's, and 80's) and a healthy sense of humor.
478;Add to that a fake music group that has about as much musical talent as some of the real groups from the era that they're satirizing, and you've got a masterpiece of a movie.
479;Of course i love it.
480;and everytime I see it, I find something new to laugh at.
481;It's really hilarious to watch this, and then flip over to VH.1 and catch Behind the Music .
482;Some of these are pretty boring and trivial, but there are some great scenes mixed in here (including a fun bit about Derek Smalls' movie career).
483;Rob Reiner also adds in some humorous promos, in character, as Marty DeBergi .
484;and clever and relevant and probably spot on in regards to how some people in the music and entertainment industry act.
485;i loved the British accents ,and some of the gags are just too funny.
486;the motley mix of characters are also great.
487;a lot of that is probably due to the writing of Christopher Guest and Michael McKean.
488;for me,This is Spinal Tap is a well deserved 4.6/5
489;Great music on its own, and a wonderfully on.
490;Funny, mockumentary of a has been British rock band.
491;I could give you a detailed synopsis of this film about has.
492;What I will say is when you have Ozzy Osbourne say that he didn't find it funny because he thought """"it was all too f**king real"""" then you know the film is worth watching and is ultra."""
493;Christopher Guest and the rest of the cast give award.
494;A true classic which stands the test of time.
495;ect. ect.) and the other features as well.
496;A must for all who enjoyed this for the last 22 years!
497;Well, these guys dissect it in the most hilarious way, and NOTHING is taken for granted.
498;roll genre (somewhere around 5 to 10 percent of it is good).
499;Thankfully there are a few truly classic films from the genre that still retain or even exceed their comedic value over time but these are few and far between.
500;This Is Spinal Tap though especially for those who are musicians or who follow the 80s rock scene closely never fails to amuse and this is mostly due to the excellent performances of Guest, McKean, Shearer and even director Reiner who is an excellent comedic actor in his own right.
501;Those of you who actually laugh at this stuff are in serious need of a qualified team of dedicated and trained deprogrammers.
502;The result is genius and not to be missed.
503;But, the part that's worth it all, and the part that will keep you rolling with laughter throughout, is the Audio Commentary by Spinal Tap.
504;Instead, I found myself doubled over with laughter as all three actors give their commentary IN CHARACTER!
505;If the movie was funny, the movie with commentary from the actors in character is hysterical!
506;You hear the guys reflecting on people they meet in the movie, making excuses for mistakes they made, and more and it all serves to make the movie that much more funny and worth watching/owning.
507;Very good film, taking a queue from The Rutles.
508;Days of the actual rock stars are gone, and this brings back the memories of all of the 80's hair bands, when stars were gods.
509;This movie is easily one of the top ten comedies of the past century.
510;It also happens to be the directorial debut of Rob Reiner (well known to all previously as All in the Family 's Michael Meat.
511;brained and hirsute rock stars are wonderfully lampooned by the trio of aging, obsolescent musicians known as Spinal Tap.
512;Enjoy this special edition of a comedy great.
513;well, as we move to the new millenium, even the most die.
514;Nice work, and a damn funny film!
515;Oh,and remember: in ten years, everyone will be laughing at these Korn.
516;More than a film, it is an interactive viewing experience.
517;The inclusion of directorial and Tap comments as well as hours of interactive additional footage and commentary brings the Tap experience to life.
518;songs are pretty catchy and fit the time.
519;it's been years, but comes right back.
520;This is absolutely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
521;I am in the live entertainment business, and when I tell you that is is all to real, would be an understatement.
522;This Is Spinal Tap was released in 1984 and is an excellent protrayal (and hillarious look at) the rise and fall of a rock band.
523;From 18 inch Stonehenges, to combusting drummers.
524;umentary is one of the most hillarious films of all time.
525;without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made.
526;Absolutely noone displays the same raw sexual energy as Nigel rockin' on Big Bottom , backed up by the tight background of David, Derek, and the drummer.
527;The classic among classics, this movie will have you rolling.
528;Michael McKean and Christopher Guest play the leads with comedic brilliance, you never ever get the sense that they are acting at all.
529;The whole film is a truly unique comedy experience.
530;This movie is a witty, well.
531;The soundtrack both pays homage as well as satirizes Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, and Van Halen perfectly.
532;(Just to name a few examples) All of the dialogue seems genuinely improvised and works exceptionally well.
533;esque girlfriend, the sweet reuniting of the band at the end of the film is all the more triumphant.
534;Either way, I would definitely give it a watch!
535;This movie is a classic comedy on the world of Rock and Heavy Metal.
536;I'm into rock, classic rock and since this is one of those classic rock films.>
537;It's kind of funny, but more so, it's just.
538;First and foremost, This Is Spinal Tap is a hilarious movie, reason enough to own it on video.
539;But this edition (like most from Criterion including Silence of the Lambs and Brazil) features an excellent.
540;Also worth seeing are the other two mockumentaries by Christopher Guest (it's the six.
541;This one defintely goes to eleven!
542;Great acting, great writing (and improv), and laugh.
543;The picture is perfect, the sound mix is great, and there is enough deleted material to almost double the length of the film.
544;This is the best version yet.
545;the commentaries are awesome, the extras are the bomb and the movie is pure comic gold.
546;on a scale of 1.10, I give it an 11.
547;Spinal Tap makes true fun out of the often mundane documentaries that seem to be all over the place now.
548;The fact that some don't get the idea that it's fake all but adds to the amazing job of the director and actors in the improv.
549;"It will give you a better view of how the pacing of dialogue, editing, and refusing to turn the camera ""off"" can create brilliant comedy."
550;You'll thank everyone who has written reviews here later.
551;i know it is a work of fiction, but I expected it to be more realistic.
552;I gave this as a Christmas present and he loved it.
553;It pokes fun at 80's rock bands, the musician's lifestyle, etc.
554;Spinal Tap has become such a cult classic that people are always reciting lines from the movie .
555;Watch this movie or your funny.
556;one of the best joke's ever!!!
557;The best part of this??
558;LOL, the greatest thing ever!!
559;It's the same crew so the laughs are there but the laughs are subtle laughs.
560;some funny parts, but had to force myself to watch all of it.
561;I love the understated humor.
562;the concept can be traced back to the brilliant opening scene of `Citizen Kane' and even earlier than that .
563;The songs use every clich of rock music without shame, and the performances of Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer as the bandmates are precise, merciless and hilarious.
564;"Best of all is Guest as virtuoso guitarist Nigel Tuffnel, who is beyond brilliant in several unforgettable scenes (including the classic `the dials go up to eleven' routine), but is also hilarious when he doesn't say a word
565;again, what makes `This Is Spinal Tap' great is the subtleness of the humor.
566;Especially for musicians and music lovers in general, who will immediately laugh at many of the easy to miss jokes, `This Is Spinal Tap' is essential viewing, and one of the funniest films you'll ever see.
567;metal bands, their catalogue actually includes a wide range of musical styles.

569;The comedy is subtly and richly layered with humorous but realistic character portrayals, malapropisms, double entendres, and numerous sight gags.
570;These guys are not only brilliant improvisors, but they are also fine musicians capable of performing a serious.
571;They really have written and performed all the wonderful lyrics and arrangements by themselves.
572;Note that you probably will need multiple viewings (without interruption) to fully appreciate the humor and to become hooked, but you will love it more and get more out of it each time it is viewed.

575;takes"
576;At first I was mixed on my feeling, as a musician I felt they were making fun of my career but this movie is so true to the 11th power.
577;There's a masterful weaving of verbatim incidents from heavy metal lore, with some that are blended or slightly exaggerated for comedic effect.
578;The writing by Shearer, Reiner, Guest, and McKean is excellent, and extends past the dialogue to the music and lyrics, which are an integral part of the overall humor.
579;Turn your speakers up to 11 and enjoy!
580;It captures the jaded cynicism of the rock scene, but then reveals itself as the ultimate parody with dialogue that sneaks up on you.
581;On top of that, the music is good, too!
582;there are at least two memorable scenes but thats it.
583;This movie must be watched more than once to really understand it but it is definitely the finest ficticious rockumentary I have ever seen.
584;Rob Reiner plays his part straight and the outcome is hilarious.
585;It's because we have these special amplieiers.
586;please reissue this comedy cult classi
587;This is an absolutely hilarious movie.
588;I highly recommend this to any garage band.
589;watching this movie now for the first time , although I grew up with the rock age, it is just remarkable.
590;The costumes are modern even by today's standards.
591;There has been a four.
592;Not only will you laugh your a*# off, but the music isn't bad at all!
593;Seriously, these guys are genius!
594;The commentary by Rob Reiner and the actors in the band gives great insight into how the film was made.
595;The commentary by the actors AS THE BAND rivals the comedy of the movie itself!
596;classic for those of us who actually watched it first time in the theaters.
597;Back in the day, it was an excellent spoof on the heavy metal culture.
598;Today, it can make us reflect on our own .
599;Viewers owe this film a debt of gratitude for any and all films in the genre since thenk, including the brilliant work of Christopher Guest.
600;The extra footage is over an hour in length, with deleted scenes that are just as funny as some of the bits in the movie.
601;Even the automatic menu opening when the disc is popped in is funny, with the Tapsters commenting on the logo.
602;anyone who is in the music business, has seen the music business, or simply loves music, will find this movie hilarious.

607;Recreations of the band's past as a 60s """"Flower Power"""" band are just perfect."""
608;this is a great Rockumentary.
609;This is the funniest rock and roll spoof of all time.
610;hands down every line is perfect and every band member perfect as well.
611;In addition to over one hour (!)
612;First of all, this is one of the funniest, most original movies ever.
613;The team of Michael McCean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer prove a winning combination.
614;A great deal of the script was improvised and is filled with subtle laughs.
615;It's an incredibly accurate look at the inner politics of a rock band.
616;what makes it even better is the ton of extras.
617;It has feature length commentary by the whole cast, a music video, and tons of insight on the making of this comedy classic.
618;Listen carefully to the lyrics.
619;crafted and superbly acted with irony dripping from every scene.
620;This ensemble works seamlessly together, even though a lot of it is improv.
621;Love the tunes and the premise.
622;It really hits home if you're a musician.

627;What is worrying is that some of their spoof tracks sound better than the real thing.
628;(the version that came out before the special edition (which featured the hilarious in.
629;"This movie is ""one louder in many ways lol"" after you watch it that will make more sense to you."
630;If you lived in the early metal days or not you'll still find it funny.
631;The movie is already great.
632;what really struck me is the extra footage.
633;It's like you get a whole extra movie!
634;if you like Spinal Tap, you'll be happy.
635;nobody should deprive themselves of the GIFT OF OWNING this uniquely brilliant movie.
636;My two stars in no way refer to the film itself, it, the movie per se, deserves a galaxy's worth.
637;have performed on tour in character as well as unwigged, as themselves.
638;Often with rock's greatest luminaries sitting in, and, I am sure, with a great sense of privilege and joy.
639;they continue to write and perform incredible music while also pursuing their other unique individual creative endeavors.
640;and had it not been for some neat to see deleted scenes and some fun to catch pseudo videos of our fav tracks from the movie.
641;oMG, Noooooooooooo!Am I the only rabid devote of this staggeringly fabulous movie starved for a commentary track by these guys as themselves, bringing us accurate, esoteric, even arcane data and insights re, in this case, an often atypical, sometimes improvised with flawless instincts.
642;i salivate (well, kinda) anticipating the arrival of a new edition including the above commentary track.
643;If you wanna see a classic 80's rock movie, then you've come to the right place.
644;Spinal tap the movie is the greatest documentary on rock music.
645;Its got pretty funny moments and the band is pure 80's.
646;Its got two rare commentaries, deleted scenes, promotional material, and other great extras.
647;So many great scenes and lines ( Rock 'n Roll .
648;One of the funniest movies ever made !
649;but I will add some observations.
650;If you ever want to crack one of them up,drop a line from Spinal Tap .
651;everyone will end up quoting their own favorite line.
652;the smart ones see the joke/danger.
653;it is just as brilliant in concept as the movie itself.
654;"but my favorite candidate for ""most based on"" is the '70's band Uriah Heep."
655;This Is Spinal Tap is a truly great rock and roll comedy.
656;According to Harry Shearer, a few live shows may take place as well.
657;The classic This is Spinal Tap is truly the greatest depiction of a rock band in cinematic history.
658;I remember watching this for the first time with my buddies.
659;And THATS what makes the movie so great.
660;the definitive rock and roll band movie.
661;This is Spinal Tap is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.
662;The deleted scenes on here double the size of the movie and I just as funny as the main movie.
663;I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy more subtle and visual comedies.
664;"If you are more into ""in your face"" humor or dirty/potty humor, you will probably not enjoy this movie very much."
665;It's funny amazingly creative but keep your eyes and ears open so you dont miss it.
666;A cult classic in a catagory all its own.
667;Surprisingly it has true to life elements in this film as well.
668;You wont belive who apears in this film and they do a fantastic job acting.
669;It's rock and roll, it's comedy, it's one of kind and is definatly SPINAL TAP!
670;I lock it in my safe!
671;"Brilliantly parodying the bloated excesses of the rock lifestyle, and gently poking fun at Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Waltz,"" director Rob Reiner invented a new genre."
672;are so convincing that many viewers thought Spinal Tap was a real act.
673;"Seen once or 30 times, ""Spinal Tap"" is relentlessly, ingeniously funny."
674;This is our GO To movie when ever we need a good laugh!
675;spinal Tap is a rare comic gem.
676;The commentery is very funny, with the actors portraying themselves as the characters.
677;the 70 minutes worth of deleted scenes are great as well.
678;the rest are music videos are entertaining and the commercials for Rock and Rolls are odd, but ae funny.
679;"A documentary made by a filmmaker named Marti DiBergi ( played by Rob Reiner) gives a look into England's loudest heavy metal band called ""Spinal Tap"" on their history from 60's swingers to a rock sensation that has swept both America and England, there is interviews with the band members Nigel Tugnel ( Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins ( Michael McKean) and Derek Smalls ( Harry Shearer) and behind the scenes of their latest album ""Smell the Glove""."
680;this entertaining and hilarious mockumentary on a fictional non.
681;existent rock band has became a cult sensation and a midnight favorite.
682;There is such originality within the script itself, a self.
683;mocking sense of humor is what helps the comedy of this movie.
684;rob Reiner's direction is flawless, there is also appearences by Fran Drescher, Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal makes this one unforgettable cult comedy experience you must not miss.
685;this is totally one of the best comedies ever made, so if you love a good laugh and rock music at the same time, i suggest you own this movie and enjoy.
686;"One of the funniest films of all time, and certainly one of the cleverest, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is as equally hysterical and subtle today as it was twenty years ago, back when Rob Reiner was pretty much known for his iconic role on the television show ""All in the Family"" ."
687;", ""A Few Good Men,"" and certainly not for being an excellent director."
688;(Now, by 2004, his films have occupied many of the various AFI lists, including the best romance films and comedies.)
689;This is Spinal Tap was the first of its kind .
690;"he admired their ""loud"" songs and now, at the height of their career, he is setting out to record their private lives that exist behind the stage."
691;(Billy Crystal also makes a cameo as a mime waiter in one of the most subtle scenes .
692;The cast performed all their own songs, as well as writing them.
693;Guest, McKean and Shearer are all gifted musicians .
694;but they're also pretty funny.
695;Part of what makes this film so effective on repeat viewings is that you're guaranteed to find some things you didn't notice last time.
696;But I beg of you, watch it again, take a chance to open your ears more, pay attention to small things in the background, and listen to those songs the guys are singing.
697;This is a film that is definitely worth owning for such purposes.
698;And, unlike so many other films, it is one that actually deserves a sequel.
699;And probably one that would be just as funny as the first.
700;as good as they are .
701;"But ""This is Spinal Tap"" was, is, and always shall be, the granddaddy of the mockumentaries."
702;"It's the ""Psycho"" of mockumentaries, and actually a lot of ""regular"" comedies, too."
703;A zillion memorable lines and scenes that make you laugh just thinking about them.
704;Interesting mix and the cast was good.
705;BTW, I like the songs in this movie as well
706;You have to see this movie , it really is like rock bands and the things they say and do , heart wrenching at times and heart warming at others.
707;i managed to compete in a number of meets and remember thinking during the various match's.
708;I ended up with a perfect record, no wins all loss's.
709;I retired after the first year and to this day am proud of my efforts.
710;Great movie, classic, first in a long tradition of mostly unscripted, but strangely cohesive, mockumentaries.
711;movie mockumentary and has continued with films like Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and A Mighty Wind.
712;Great early morning film when you're tired of the news.
713;documentary, but it is always soooo funny.
714;The first film of Rob Reiner is one the best comedies of all time.
715;The actors are amazing, the artistic direction is great, and the songs are very funny and greats too.
716;is one the best ideas for make a splendit film.
717;It recomends for all the people love the rock music and the ironic comedies for these music world.
718;A classic with Michael McKean showing comic brilliance!On tour with fictional metal band, Spinal Tap.
719;Once with a real square homemaker type.
720;This movie is absolutely hysterical.
721;It pokes fun at rock bands, especially heavy metal bands beyond their prime.
722;There are so many great lines in here, many of them from their manager (i. e. Australian's Nightmare ,etc.) and a ton of up and coming stars.
723;This movie is one of the truly funny films that I can reccomend to anyone with a brain and guarantee you will absolutely love it and want to watch it again and again.
724;First and foremost I just want to take a moment to laugh at the idiot below who states that he's intelligent while also believing that Spinal Tap is a real band and he says he has all that knowledge of music and yet, Limp Bizkit is his favorite band.
725;it is excellent from start to finish.
726;the opening menu is classic and quite hilarious.
727;all of the characters are played out well and it has many unforgettable moments that will have you laughing.
728;Christopher Guest is probably the most brilliant comedy director living, and *This Is Spinal Tap* is one of the the most perfect examples of dead.
729;this is an important movie to gain cultural intelligence.
730;this infamous mockumentary details the life of the band, Spinal Tap , and its members as they tour the USA.
731;what surprises me most about this movie, though, is that the music is actually good!
732;It is rare that you will find a movie that will always be funny, and this is one of those rarities!
733;This is Spinal Tap is a lot of fun, but the fun dissipates somewhat once the members of the band have their falling.
734;Still there's a lot of really funny stuff here and This is Spinal Tap is one.
735;If you like Best in Show , Waiting for Guffman , or A Mighty Wind you'll probably enjoy this mock rockumentary.
736;Maybe it's my weakness for silly humor, but This is Spinal Tap is easily in my top 5 list of comedies .
737;The cucumber scene was priceless, and the mishap during Stonehenge was hilarious.
738;Big Bottom is one of the funiest songs I've ever heard.
739;Its a historical movie and you should watch it.
740;as a child from the 80s I thought this movie wasnt that great.
741;is the closest bottomline I can draw for this film.
742;Made in 1984, This is Spinal Tap is a great mockumentary that shows the rise and fall of a great but imaginary band.
743;"I particularly love the parody with their early song ""Flower People""."
744;developed and realistic (if you're a rocker you may agree with this more =)).
745;criterion disc contains an extra of 60.
746;print but it's the definitive edition of this great movie.
747;This Is Spinal Tap is one of the funniest movies ever made period.
748;Every time I watch it I laugh as if I've never seen it before.
749;The inner friction and the inflated egos surely exists.
750;Reiner does an outstanding job of building this into a timeless comedy.
751;His casting is also spot on.
752;I enjoy Spinal Tap every time I view it.
753;Stands up well after many years.
754;in summary great movie, go ahead and pick it up.
755;Criterion Collection 04.05.99Movie: One of my favorite comedies.
756;Extra footage is interesting but not overwhelming.
757;It is still incredible relevant and hilarious!
758;My favorite comedies are the ones you can quote in every day life and this one is great for that.
759;Even the animated menu is funnier than some films' actual content.
760;There is no better gem in video humour than This is Spinal Tap .
761;pan nature of the band's attempts to make it big are so hilarious that you laugh at the escapades they take in recreating a come back of their former (lack of) glory.
762;The songs are musically excellent, and like the rest of the movie, it's acting and script (and improv)are hilarious in how closely they parody real bands.
763;We laugh because we are watching a rock group self.
764;destruct, but everyone but the group iteself knows that it is happening.
765;Get serious, watch Tap and have a laugh from start to finish.
766;Great to put on at a party.
767;A look on how it might be to be a big rock star on a funny side.
768;This is my era from growing up and I expected more, and funnier.
769;I had a hard time watching it and I had to watch it for a class that I was taking.
770;"Plus 'HEAVY METAL MEMORIES"", the unforgettable greatest."
771;One of the brightest, funniest American parodies to come along since 'AIRPLANE'.
772;"Sheila Benson, LOS ANGELES TIMES""HILARIOUS . . . witty, mischievous satire."""
773;"Janet Maslin, NEW YORK TIMES""One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time."""
774;Spinal Tap may have been an interesting story, but they're hardly a band worth making immortal through film.
775;It's yin and, what's that other one, yang.
776;Also, the archive stuff is great, and a reminder of how musicianly the Tap has always been, even in their early incarnations.
777;So I recommend this film to anyone who likes to boogie.
778;This movie could be watched a gazillion times and still be funny.
779;This is an all time classic.
780;If you're from the hairband era and can appreciate it you will definately enjoy this classic rock.
781;on satire of a wacky 1980's heavy metal band.
782;The story is weird but you have the gut feeling it is a perceptive lampoon of what was going on in the 80's rock gigs.
783;Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer are fantastic as they keep their characters real and slightly off regular logic.
784;"Spinal Tap is full of inside jokes for those in the music industry, as well as a vicarious look into the lives of a rock band for the average ""Joe"" and wannabees."
785;This isn't as funny as the other Christopher Guest movies but I would recommend it for Guest fans.
786;This movie is one of the funniest on my list.
787;I also love the bonus features when they show outtakes or follow ups on the movie.
788;This is without the funniest rock n roll band ever.
789;up hard rock bands that still think they are God's gift to the universe.
790;The inspired idiocy borders on genius at times, lending weight to Michael's observation that there is a fine line between stupid and clever .
791;what makes this all the more amazing is the shear quantity of extras on the disk.
792;And as if that weren't enough, there is also a commentary track throughout the entire film with the band members, completely in character, being as hilariously idiotic as they are in the film.
793;Menu transitions are computer animations inspired by some of the film's funniest moments.
794;Spinal Tap is one of the very funniest movies that I have ever seen.
795;Certainly, it is the funniest one that I can think of off the top of my head.
796;The movie is an comedy classic.
797;It is brilliant from start to finish and is so rich with hilaious dialogue and physical acting that it will stand the test of infinite viewings.
798;Rob Reiner is at his best in this movie, and keeps up admirably with the constant improvisation of the films stars.
799;It is moments like these that will continue to pop up and amuse viewers forever, should they tire of the bigger jokes in the movie.
800;Indeed that is the mark of a great comedy.
801;The behavior of the band in this movie, as hilarious and over the top as it may be, can never be too far from the truth.
802;For an example of this, think of how an all black cover is a comedy piece in this movie, and yet a few years later Metallica released one of the most successful albums of the past 20 years with an almost identical cover.
803;That provides even more depth and humor to a movie and helps to further cement its reputation as a true classic.
804;This was a great movie which I could watch over and over again.
805;It is definately one of the funniest movies ever made.
806;For those who feel it is stupid, you'd be surprised how realistic it actually is for musicians.
807;In the years I was in rock bands, I encountered so many of the topics in the movie .
808;the arguments, band meetings, people quitting and rejoining, new band direction when member leaves, name changes.
809;The best there ever was, is, and ever will be.
810;There are so many inside jokes in this movie (many of them visual) that can only be fully appreciated by musicians that I almost hesitate to give it a great overall recommendation.
811;Well, yeah, but very human as well.
812;"there's some great extra material on this BD, including clips from the old ""Joe Franklin Show"" that ran for decades on NYC TV."
813;Blast from the past!This film comes up great on BD, including the soundtrack.
814;Arguabley the funniest movie ever msde began a new genre the mocumentry.
815;Gave this as a gift.
816;plus they sound better than most of the coq.
817;Saw this for the first time in many years and continue to enjoy it.
818;It is a classic (mock rockumentuary?)
819;The music is enjoyable, the lyrics are hilarious, the theme of aging rockers is still quite relevant.
820;I'm an expert on music (I studied the art form for four years, know every artist of the last 40 years, and scored an A+ on my math test.
821;And to top it all off, the interviewer is some guy named Rob (who resembles a pig!
822;That's right, a little piggy!)
823;Nice try, Fran, but I didn't believe it for one second!
824;Just wait until Limp Bizkit (the greatest band ever!)
825;makes a documentary on their wild and crazy and cool antics!
826;Got the it was good very nice good movie very funny my wife like to quote it a lot she like nigel
827;"guests best, and not a wave maker upon release
828;talent this history making and culture changing movie exudes.
829;this movie is a classic.
830;its one of my all time favorites.
831;Very funny rockumentary spoof .
832;Nigel Tufnel is the best!
833;Worth seeing again if you haven't seen in a while.
834;Anyone who enjoys music and has a good sense of humor should watch this video.
835;I don't have to tell you how brilliant this movie is.
836;The same team that made 'Waiting for Guffman' and 'Best in Show' started with this mockumentary about the fictional band Spinal Tap.
837;this new edition has many special feautures.
838;For starters the menu in the beginning has commentary by the bandmembers which is really funny.
839;Disc 1 also has the entire movie with commentary by the three main band members.
840;It's almost as funny as the movie itself, but best seen late at night after an evening of partying.
841;It has more than an hour worth of outtakes!
842;it also has some music videos, TV commercials and a hilarious press conference by the Flower People, the band they were in before Spinal Tap.
843;I can't recommend this movie.
844;Man, this movie is incredibly!
845;I love the dry humor of this movie.
846;I've been a huge music fan for years and love the way the various scenarios are blown out of proportion.
847;But this is also true for the Monty Python films.
848;This is a very good film in the same kind of satirical spirit as the Pythons.
849;This is a great film with many funny moments.
850;Tons of great special features!
851;This additional footage is great stuff.
852;Watching the movie with the new audio commentary is awesome.
853;It's like a whole new Tap movie!
854;Great idea on their parts.
855;I was very surprised by this very clever and hilarious mockumentary.
856;Like The Blair Witch Project, a lot of people thought this movie was real.)
857;And now that it is restored and loaded with extras, the film is even better.
858;Along that road to fame comes bumps and unexpected events.
859;Though this movie is hilarious, it's funny in a very subtle way, so it makes you believe that you are watching an actual documentary.
860;As funny as it may seem, the movie does seem to have a ring of truth when it comes to the music business.
861;The funniest part is when you go to the menu and you hear the band trying to figure out what the buttons mean.
862;It's pretty funny to hear the whole thing.
863;There are also lots of rare out.
864;takes that are defiantly worth seeing.
865;It's great listening to it the second time you see it.
866;It's pretty funny when they accuse the director of having a fake beard.
867;This is Spinal Tap is a cult classic, and is an awesome movie.
868;It's a very clever satire of documentaries on rock bands.
869;This is a classic film that you will not forget.
870;Possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen.
871;Watching the movie is great, but then watching the movie with the audio commentary (which features the musicians talking about random stuff, like ear infections, the name of their skull, if people are dead, making fun of Viv), is even funnier.
872;The start up menu is amazingly funny as well.
873;The funniest movie ever made!!
874;Without a doubt the best movie about rock and roll and perhaps one of the funniest movies ever made.
875;Tap fans can talk in a type of shorthand and crack each other up by simply mentioning that """"Boston is not a big college town"""", or humming the tune to """"Big Bottom""""."""
876;"The film also holds up very well over time without any ""jokes"" lost to time."
877;"In fact, my band uses ""Tap"" as a role model for success."
878;Spinal tap is quite simply the finest rockumentary that you will ever see.
879;Worth it just for the mini Stonehenge bit.
880;defunct Megaphone records to keep their brilliant catalog out of print.
881;This Rock or should i say MockUmentry is the funniest one out there.
882;These guys really know how to make this kind of comedy work.
883;But they just dont understand the brilliant humour of Spinal Tap, and the very clever way it has been presented to make you laugh.
884;the bonus features are great, there is 2 discs packed full of extra goodies, video clips, interveiws, telivision appearences.
885;and A Mighty Wind which is along the same lines as how TIST was shown, but about folk music, but trust me, its a good film!
886;The kids even enjoyed it and now fully understand what it means to turn it to 11.
887;And yet you wait for the punchline.
888;And when the punchline happens, you laugh.
889;Staying power like that is a sign of a well.
890;what surprised me about the movie when I saw it recently, was that amongst a sea of cartoonish caricatures, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest give strikingly real performances.
891;witted for the most part (the mini sandwich scene is good evidence of this), but his jealousy when David's girlfriend shows up is tangible and quite touching.
892;Harry Shearer's Derek Smalls has some shining moments, my favourite being his stunt at the airport metal.
893;what makes this movie the classic that it is are the songs.
894;The most astounding thing to me is that they were written and performed by the actors themselves.
895;And they ably shift from youthful skiffle music ( All the Way Home ), to watered.
896;And the fact that the boys can play their instruments elevates the concert footage above other instances of actors.
897;What I'm here to say is that 'Tap' stays good, no matter how many times you've seen it.
898;funny,Original&one of those Films that ages easily.
899;This Mockumentary was so perfectly done that many who see it (ok the slow ones) think that Tap is a real band.
900;Funny, and funny over and over.
901;so all I can say is trust those who say this is great, because although some may be surprised by that deduction, the movie truly is terrific.
902;Fortunately, I got the best deal I could have imagined.
903;"Shop with vigilence as much as with ""confidence."
904;"as for the difference between Criterion's version and the recent ""Special Edition,"" the former includes a terrific commentary track by director Rob Reiner and his production crew, and an equally great one by actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Sheerer."
905;These commentaries go a long way toward giving viewers insight into the creative process gone through to make such a complex comedy.
906;humor is present throughout this film.
907;Dialogue and character interactions are authentic.
908;The core cast went on to other great films like Best in Show and A Mighty Wind.
909;The movie is just as great as you remember, and the extras are something that, as a fan, you need to see.
910;Great actors are in this movie.
911;Worth seeing if you like this type of movie
912;This is, hands down, one of the funniest send.
913;ups of the Metal/Hard Rock genre you will ever see!
914;Marty Dibergi (Rob Reiner) takes us on this wondrous Rockumentary with England's Loudest Band the now.
915;The subtle humor enforced in this flick is genuinely hysterical.
916;I have never laughed as hard.
917;Aside from Monty Python and the Holy Grail and maybe Young Frankenstein, I'd say this is one of my favorite comedies of all time.
918;this is a masterpiece of satire and deliciously detailed comedy.
919;It also bulges with some of the daftest, most accurate send.
920;and how we've all bought the records by the ton!
921;it's really quite alright to love,be obsessed with, and endlessly quote a classic like Spinal Tap if you have one or two like minded individuals around who can tolerate it.
922;Anyone with an appreciation for Zeppelin's Song Remains the Same and other rockumentaries will have a ball with this film.
923;it is funny and most of it is true to the rock life style.
924;In 1984, Rob Reiner helped craft this hilarious masterpiece that would become an instant classic with comedy fans and heavy metal headbangers alike.
925;All in all, fans of comedies or fans of heavy metal music with a sense of humor should more than give this a look.
926;This is a hilarious movie!
927;Improve and famous faces make this movie funny and enjoyable.
928;This movie is truely the funniest movie about rock music.
929;Plus the only one(I think),but this movie is just plain hilarious.
930;but then I found out it didnt so, its cool.
931;The special feattures are really cool too.
932;The commentary is freakin hilarious.
933;A classic comedy rockumentry .
934;Wanna laugh this movie goes to 11!
935;This one, Waiting for Guffman, and Best in Show.
936;And while it was funny, and was a brilliant directoral debut and a groundbreaking movie for the new genre in 1984, this one doenst measure up to his other movies.
937;Its a cult classic, and i can see why.
938;Its that certain type of humor that some think is hilarious, and some just dont get.
939;femenist album cover, and some great moments where i almost laughed until i cried.
940;I ended up laughing more at this than the movie itself, which is saying a lot.
941;key kind of humor that makes the movie so subtly brilliant.
942;without a doubt it's the funniest rock spoof of all time (well, it's not exactly hard, is it?
943;, but for my money I can't think what beats it for the title of funniest movie of all time, bar none.
944;it's completely on the money.
945;a lot of it is based on recorded fact.
946;What is more amazing .
947;, they STILL record experimental jazz concept albums (Radiohead!)
948;The little vignettes are what make tap so rewarding to rewatch.
949;Every time you'll pick up a new point.
950;And then stops and tunes it half way through!
951;one of my all time favorite movies!
952;Having grown up during the seventies and eighties and being a musician I have always appreciated this great film.
953;This should be in the top 100 (at least) of the all time greatest movies about rock and roll.
954;Well worth the price of admission.
955;Having played music for a living for 5 years, I always think maybe I'm a bit bias on how much I love this movie.
956;But what makes Spinal Tap so enjoyable besides the subject matter, is the formation of such likable characters.
957;I always compared Spinal Tap to a fine wine.
958;the longer you let it age, the better it will taste.
959;Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner aka Meathead ) is back with his rockumentary classic in the digital medium.
960;The graphic design on the package and disc itself is simple.
961;A funny little read, but I always seem to want more from an inner pamphlet!
962;Anyway, the choices you have are Scene Selections , which has a very impressive graphical design.
963;Scenes are numbered and each one has a picture and description.
964;Your final choice from the main menu is Special Features.
965;You can watch the film with audio commentary by the band which is really funny because the bands IQ seems to have decreased throughout the years!
966;You also have a recent interview with Marty DiBergi, and you can watch over 1 hour of rare outtakes which are hysterical!
967;You will find yourself laughing again and again!
968;So I started to watch the film and a smile came to my face as Marty DiBergi introduces us to his film.
969;The new digital transfer is fairly clean.
970;The picture is sharp and surpasses any previous release.
971;The colors, especially during the concert footage are also a noticeable improvement over any previous release.
972;The picture is far from poor and will be pleasing to most viewers.
973;It sounds great on 2 speaker set.
974;The production track is dated, but overall pleasing for this type of film.
975;The music track sounds like it has been improved, sounding much cleaner then the production track, and opening up in ambiance and atmosphere a great deal during concert scenes.
976;The menu design and navigation are excellent, and the technical aspects of the disc are quite pleasing.
977;This is Spinal Tap is a very funny and entertaining film.
978;have for anyone who loved the movie.
979;The extra footage is extensive and hilarious.
980;if you like rock music and guys who take music too seriously then youll love this film.
981;the preserved moose line at the end is probably the best line ever written.
982;Received this movie as a gift and it was detective.
983;This is so clever that it hurts.
984;People who dont get this type of comedy are the same people who think Friends is the greatest comedy show ever made.
985;This is comedy for real comedy fans.
986;I always loved the movie and often thought of getting it.
987;Also, it pokes fun at some of the quirks of rockers and other people associated with the music business.
988;Rob Reiner was great in this too.
989;This is a great movie.
990;One that you can watch over again, and laugh at the jokes that you missed the first time.
991;but for very rare exceptions.
992;wow and a ha ha!!!
993;i recomend this movie to all who love rock and to all who love comedy.
994;This is a must see.
995;sooo good to see the background actors.
996;rob captures the rockudrama that is realistic.
997;The concert sequences are great as the Tap's songs are great spoofs of the metal genre with titles like Stonehedge Big Bottoms .
998;The movie is woefully short, so the extra footage is a welcome addition.
999;Tony Hendra is brilliant as the band's put upon manager and a young Fran Drescher shows up as a record label executive while Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal have a small bit as mime waiters.
1000;One of the funniest movies ever.
1001;Great cast, great lines, and many laugh out loud moments.
1002;get it and watch it!
1003;This is one of the funniest satire films ever made.
1004;This is Rob Reiner's finest film making moment.
1005;He will never duplicate this genius again.
1006;Can't believe I waited so long to see this gem!
1007;Many laugh out loud moments.
1008;Want to watch it again!
1009;How great this movie is.
1010;I showed it to y fiancee who had never had the pleasure and we laughed for hours.
1011;I really recommend this edition as it has the movie which is a classic but the extras which include never seen before scenes that didn't make it to the final movie are hilarious.
1012;There is heaps of extra footage.
1013;I have recommended this to all my friends who love Spinal Tap.
1014;Rob Reiner and the rest of the cast, McKean, Guest, and Shearer, walk a very fine line between silly and extremely clever.
1015;But an even more interesting line is the one between parody and reality.
1016;important, dim, and pretentious as this one.
1017;Part of the brilliance of this film is that it could almost be taken seriously.
1018;It is amazing to watch this and see the other people who show up in the backbround (or briefly in the foreground) of the rather impressive cast.
1019;This is truly a comic gem that invented its own genre as a 'mockumentary.'
1020;This is a funny little film that basically sparked a whole new genre.
1021;"And get it all he does
1022;It's all here, and we owe it all to a man of incredible intuition, imagination and foresight, Marty DiBergi.
1023;When this film was released in 1984, it was fresh and new, cutting edge satire that seemed almost outrageous and scathingly intemperate"
1024;"With genuine sincerity, Reiner/DiBergi delivers a truly believable ""Rockumentary."""
1025;His pace and timing are impeccable, and his eye for detail is thorough (though much of it will be lost on today's generation).
1026;"The songs may be dated but the humor is timeless
1027;The appeal of this film is going to vary from generation to generation, and it follows that the level of appreciation is going to vary"
1028;Always enjoyed Rob Reiner (or his dad)
1029;watch this gut busting parody of the fantasy which calls itself rock and roll and youll see why.
1030;a must see for anybody who mistakenly believes such a thing really exists !
1031;It has always been my laughter security blanket.
1032;The outtakes/deleted scenes (which I had only read about) add so much more to what was already a great film.
1033;I laughed 'til I had tears.
1034;This movie is the work of sheer genius.
1035;You'll never take any rock group seriously after watching this hilarious spoof.
1036;The characters are hilarious and the lyrics of the songs are even funnier.
1037;It's a tribute to their talent that alot of these songs sound quite good!
1038;There's actually a small treat of brief appearances of famous people in several scenes.
1039;I have never laughed so hard at a movie then sat back and reflected on just how accurately it satired and applied to the real world of rock 'n roll.
1040;THere is, quite literally a whole other movie on side two.
1041;Every bit as good as the original.
1042;I'm a huge metal fan.
1043;And with that enjoyment of heavy metal comes an appreciation of the greatest rock satire of all.
1044;The result is a plethora of classic scenes and one.
1045;"The film is also filled with live performances of such Spinal Tap classics as Big Bottom,"" ""Hell Hole,"" and ""Sex Farm."""
1046;Each is as hilarious as its title would suggest and does a great job of skewering the big dumb sex mentality of many hard rock bands.
1047;This Is Spinal Tap rewards repeat viewings, as it delivers as much subtle humor as in.your.
1048;This is one of the funniest parodies of all time.
1049;Spinal Tap is SO good, in fact, that you can turn to VH1 after watching it, and bust a gut laughing at the REAL rockumentaries!
1050;Instead, this scene, like many others is played for laughs.
1051;I have no idea how many times I have seen this film, but every viewing makes me love it more.
1052;the film skewers every part of the pop music business through wonderful period flashbacks and hysterical situations that unfold during the course of the tour.
1053;"The film also features great cameos from luminaries such as Billy Crystal (""mime is money,"") Bruno Kirby (""Spinal Pap,"") and Howard Hesseman as rock star Duke Fame (""I'd love to stay and talk, but I have to go sit in the lobby and wait for the limo."")"
1054;but at least their dressing rooms are bigger than the puppet's.
1055;An eventual tour of Japan resolves a number of plot loose ends, although they do lose another drummer in a mysterious green explosion.
1056;in sum: this is the perfect movie.
1057;It became my favorite the first time I saw it on the big screen, and through many, many subsequent viewings it has managed to retain that status.
1058;The character performances were outstanding.
1059;I watch it every couple of months.
1060;This was a funny movie with a weird sense of humor.
1061;There are alot of cool extras on the blu.
1062;Deleted scenes, fictional character commentary, and a new interview with the fictional characters.
1063;There are also a lot of funny bits in the commentary, and there are a lot of funny features.
1064;Every musician has at least one embarrassing moment on stage.
1065;What makes this even better is that when the film first came out, people believed that this was an actual documentary.
1066;personal strife between band members, this is funny for the 60.70's group.
1067;mcKean is just outstanding in this one.
1068;The best part about this movie was all the people famous today, who were really young then!
1069;interesting cast but not a very good movie.
1070;Some of it is included and it makes the experience that much more exciting.
1071;At the same time it makes you thirst for more
1072;This movie is an adequate film to view or watch.
1073;Spinal Tap is a certified cult classic.
1074;All but a few of the extra scenes are fantastic.
1075;Especially wonderful are the bits where the band is musing about the speed of elevators and how your neck brakes if you break the sound barrier or the band's philosophising on the diet of gorillas .
1076;This is a great movie.
1077;Not only is it a great mockumentary, but also a great movie too.
1078;It strikes perfectly with everything it's parodying.
1079;To me, that makes it even funnier, it's as a good as real life.
1080;before=seen footage, 4 music videos, and plenty of other extras to love.
1081;Then some commentary as you navigate the menu (especially funny is the subtitles bit).
1082;some of the extras aren't the funniest, so it's obvious as to why they were removed from the final cut, but some are hilarious!
1083;This scene is as funny as anything in the movie.
1084;A nice touch is the audio commentary featuring all three in character as they analyze the truthfulness of DiBergi's representation and recall old times.
1085;All in all, if you're a Tap fan, this will make you forget about the Hellhole you live in!
1086;A great continuation of the Tap legacy.
1087;Spinal Tap is a classic!
1088;One of the funniest movie of all time.
1089;On a scale of 1.10 how much I enjoyed this movie, it was an 11!
1090;Spinal Tap the movie is a great piece of satire.
1091;For those who know the 70s and 80s, they can definitely pick who is being satirised, and if you have ever heard Harry Shearer's show on NPR, then you can appreciate the humour that goes in to one part of the writing of this film.
1092;In fact with the Original film, the commentary, and the 1 hour and 7 minutes of extra footage, you basically have THREE shows.
1093;the Value here is collossal, and totally excellent.
1094;The movie itself is great.
1095;It features three gifted comic actors who are, in understated and clever ways, as funny as anyone on the planet.
1096;Clearly Reiner could have assembled a very funny 120.
1097;He went with a lean 83.
1098;the third way in which this is great is in providing an extra audio track in which the three principal members of Tap speak, in character (as always) about their memories of the film and the ways in which their ex.
1099;Three funny people, fully in character, improvising and bouncing off each other's ideas on the spot.
1100;That's what they did in making this film, and to hear them doing it again years later on a seperate audio track is a joy.
1101;"This is Spinal Tap is one of the most original, subtle, hilarious movies you will ever see, and offers more great quotes than any film this side of ""Fletch."
1102;"A mockumentary,"" ""Tap"" is pure fiction."
1103;But it's fiction that captures some universal truths about the relentless pursuit of a dream, even while the rest of the world is screaming at you to wake up.
1104;"We see Reiner travel with the band on tour to promote its newest album, ""Smell the Glove,"" and he gets to interview the band at great length ."
1105;"rock of the '70s (""Sex Farm,"" ""Stonehenge,"" ""Big Bottom""), with a little psychedelic feel."
1106;"good rock in there too (""Listen to the Flower People"")."
1107;One of the best soundtracks ever, these songs skewer the performers as well as those you who were fans of this kind of music when it was big.
1108;It's a fine line between stupid and clever .
1109;Odds are, without saying any more, you're going to see a wide smile and start getting the quotes.
1110;The filmmakers' understanding of (and affection for) life on the road in the music business is eerie.
1111;This is Spinal Tap is a good comedy movie to watch for only one time.
1112;Rob Reiner delivers the goods in this hilarious documentary style account of the rock group Spinal Tap .
1113;If you remember that time period, you can take the journey back.
1114;I strongly recommend this movie to musicians .
1115;They'll truly appreciate the humor!
1116;Those alone should give you plenty of insight as to why this is one of the greatest movies of all time.
1117;"To wit:""Oh, there actually is, uh."
1118;It's like a Mach piece, really.
1119;Dozens of people spontaneously combust each year.
1120;It's like, how much more black could this be?
1121;Well, the visuals are even funnier.
1122;"classical"" shred style, unique ways to use a violin, and of course lots and lots of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."
1123;Everybody should have this film.
1124;Heard about this movie a while ago and thought I would give it a chance.
1125;Can't believe how funny it is.
1126;My best friend recommended this to me as the funniest movie ever.
1127;This is the best mockumentary ever made.
1128;Its subtle, biting jabs at the rock and role industry helped pave the way for great comedies like Waiting for Guffman and Best In Show, and the performances (especially by Christopher Guest) are true class.
1129;The new 5.1 soundtrack is just plain excellent, finally giving us the chance to hear Big Bottom, Hell Hole, and Sex Farm in surround.
1130;there are a ton of extras as well, most notable being the commentary by Guest, harry Shearer, and Michael McKean, who are in full character as Spinal Tap.
1131;Its as funny as the film itself.
1132;this is a fans dream.
1133;This is a class humor movie.
1134;I always loved this movie, but the special edition is even better.
1135;the commentary by the guys from Spinal Tap in character is hilarious.
1136;These guys are great at improv, which is what a lot of the movie was.
1137;"Although it wasn't the first mockumentary (I believe Albert Brooks ""Real Life"" was one, if not the first) this still is considered by most THE mocumentary that now inspired movie hits like Borat."
1138;please watch this, and then watch it again if you din't get it the frist time, and find yourself growing to like this really funny movie.
1139;I should've bought this movie a long time ago.
1140;The price was really great and the shipping was very fast!
1141;One of those movies that gets funnier each time as new jokes and sight gags are noticed.
1142;Well worth a watch for those who like music and/or comedy.
1143;This movie is really funny.
1144;I have had many folks who are into Opera and Country music see this movie and they love it.
1145;One of the funniest movies of all time!
1146;Yes, this was a great deal!!
1147;The comedic writing and acting doesn't get much better.
1148;best in Show: The Films of Christopher Guest and Company,Waiting for Guffman,A Mighty Wind,Return of Spinal Tap.
1149;For me this movie is one of the funniest movies that I have seen even to this day.
1150;to sum it up in one sentence: This movie is awesome.
1151;At any rate, this movie is just superb, following the waning career of British heavy metal band Spinal Tap.
1152;Filmed just like a documentary, this film is genius.
1153;rather, I found something that mirrored a real documentary.
1154;The music makes fun of other bands.
1155;most notable to me is Stonehenge , which seems to be making fun and paying homage (at the same time) to Led Zeppelin.
1156;the most impressive part is that everyone learned to play the songs.
1157;it's actually Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean playing their instruments and singing.
1158;This just added so much to the film itself.
1159;There are several sequences that make you chuckle but precious few sequences that produce any laugh.
1160;In the end, This is Spinal Tap is a form over substance film.
1161;The acting is great and the cameos by Fran Drescher, Paul Shaffer, Anjelica Huston, and Fred Willard are amusing but there is little energy to help sustain the film for its 82.
1162;The film is merely adequate and, unlike the band itself which is saved at the end by their Japanese fans, is never salvaged before it concludes.
1163;I could give him an Oscar for his brilliant performance.
1164;these guys literally become Gods by the way they poke fun at Rockstars and their mannerisms particularly when it comes to giving interviews and playing live.
1165;In fact this movie is so well made that it puts to shame serious rockumentaries made for real rockstars and bands.
1166;the extras are as good as the original movie.
1167;You wonder how brilliantly the actors have come together to pull off something like this.
1168;neatly packaged even the liner notes are funny.
1169;Almost every move made and every line spoken is worth being labelled funny.
1170;This is one of my favorite movies, no doubt.
1171;I must have seen this movie 20 times, and I still love it.
1172;There is always something new that I catch each time.
1173;This is the rock documentary film, better than any real documentary that has ever been or ever will be.
1174;It's a bit like Withnail and I, where you're primarily watching it for opportunities to get more of that great dialogue, but the musical numbers are wonderful as well, and so are some of the sight gags.
1175;but the music is wonderful and the boys are great at approximating an energetic classic '70s rock band's stage show, and they fill an audience with extras ready to rock out.
1176;"The ""Rare Outtakes"" section includes over an hour of stuff, including more Billy Crystal mime segment stuff, together with some Dana Carvey and Bruce Kirby in some interesting scenes."
1177;Drummer demonstrates his encyclopedic knowledge of baseball in a very funny skit about a radio show where a caller.
1178;The actors are actually good musicians .
1179;two musical hearts beating as one (it's like Lips and Robb of Anvil many years later).
1180;There's such a fine line between stupid and clever.
1181;I could hold my own with a gorilla.
1182;"Water on your face in the morning is the strongest drug."""
1183;When they say the camera doesn't lie .
1184;Director Rob Reiner (who appears in the film as documentary maker Marty) and actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer playing the three lead musicians in Spinal Tap capitalize on the silliness and take it to outrageous and hilarious lengths with their pitch perfect deadpan deliveries.
1185;Packed with funny one liners this film can be watched multiple times without losing enjoyment.
1186;If I could, I would give this movie 11 stars.
1187;It cut it with the frequency of humor it had and with the story it presents.
1188;read the quote with amazement and then burst with laughter realising it's seriously said.
1189;This film attempts to make something look funny when it's already hilarious to begin with.
1190;i read the official review from Amazon and at the very end of it, it says that this is the best rocumentary ever made.
1191;But Almost Famous is leagues better than Spinal Tap, it's far more poignant, far more accurate, far funnier, far deeper (ok, that wouldn't be too difficult) and it far more captures the times it portrays than Spinal Tap could ever hope to.
1192;i think that Spinal Tap is still watchable exactly because we know this is real (well, some of us do).
1193;Such a fine line between stupid and clever.
1194;I would watch this over and over and I do as often as I can.
1195;I recomend it to anyone.
1196;Outrageous, wild and intense fun.
1197;"The best comedy i own is also the best mockumentary and the best ""cult"" classic in my collection, all in one."
1198;"My devotion for this masterpiece is so great, that i can't help to rejoice in every view, over the misadventures of the intellectually challenged, charming, goofy and charismatic members of the Cult British heavy metal band, legendary ""Spinal Tap""."
1199;After years of intense exposure to this movie, my emotions still run faster and higher than ever.
1200;"The most amazing thing, the cast actually composed and recorded the soundtrack on studio, so they actually ""rock"" their instruments."
1201;nowhere group of misfits, and we can laugh with the band and at the band.
1202;This improvised free style circus got all the elements to crack your jaw out of pure laughter.
1203;Elegant, well balanced and masterful conception, and definetly not a fart or pie.
1204;face comedy, the ultimate mockumentary rocked even the heavy metal world, wich at first thought the band existed (!)
1205;What a masterpiece, what a concept, such originality and genious all over the place and in every single aspect.
1206;The mockumentary style was first perfected with Rob Reiner's amazing satire of a declining hard rock band, and this movie manages to serve both as a comedy, and an eerily authentic seeming documentary.
1207;The performances are all spectacular, although I'll always see Christopher Guest's performance as Nigel Tufnel, the lead guitarist, as the most inspired.
1208;That most of the dialogue was inprovised is amazing.
1209;That this movie is available with such a wealth of extras is amazing as well.
1210;This Is Spinal Tap has to stand as one of the greatest parodies ever produced.
1211;Anyone who loves and follows heavy metal music, especially the new wave of British heavy metal movement (Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, etc.), will appreciate how well Spinal Tap skewers the stereotypes.
1212;Throw in some oblique references to even the most venerable acts in music, such as the Beatles, and you have a movie that pulls off the rare feat of being incredibly silly, bitingly witty, critical of heavy metal music, and paying tribute to the genre all at the same time.
1213;The commentary by the principles, who stay in character, is a treat, as are the song videos, fake commercials, trailers, etc.
1214;A few good chuckle moments, but primarily a near.
1215;The Criterion edition is LOADED with special features and is well worth the money for any fan of the movie.
1216;a great collector's item also.
1217;Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap is one of the funniest movies of all time period.
1218;Let alone funniest movie about Rock and Roll.
1219;This is the perfect send.
1220;From the gigantic skull prop to the double neck bass, this movie captures everything that is humorous about heavy metal bands on tour.
1221;Most of the humor is subtle though, so this might not appeal to a Chris Farley or Adam Sandler fan.
1222;There's also a bunch of other add on's and special features like music videos, commentary, and trailers.
1223;Just ordered my special edition copy.
1224;This is a great movie that you can watch over and over again.
1225;From 11 to Stonehenge, this will keep you laughing from beginning to end.
1226;this movie is a well.
1227;I loved every minute of this video .
1228;what is great is that I feel it is a movie that anyone could enjoy it .
1229;Turn this up to 11 (thanks to the new remastering, and with some DUBLY thrown in for sure :) and enjoy this classic all over again.
1230;Sure, it's a 20+ year old movie and never looked that great to begin with, but they really did a fantastic job in the transfer.
1231;The sound is also very good.
1232;Highly recommend if you're a fan.
1233;he appeared grateful to be inducted but mentioned that, in all honesty, every band in rock fears becoming Spinal Tap.
1234;At least with SPINAL TAP, you're aware of an intelligence behind the lunacy.
1235;i actually saw Spinal Tap on tour in the early 1990's and it was easily the funniest rock concert I've ever seen (and they really played!)
1236;"As some rock stars have said ""its so funny it hurts"" with its almost right on look."
1237;Its a glimpse into the world of rock n roll.
1238;Well a funny glimpse for sure.
1239;Filled with surprise appearences this will keep you laughing.
1240;this movie is worth the price to see the guitar room scene, airport security, and stone henge.
1241;It's a classic and the hour+ of outtakes, and 2 commentary tracks help add to the depth of the movie, and some of the outtakes show that the real movie was only a SMALL portion of what was conceived for this brilliant piss.
1242;brits been so good at being British!
1243;And all the rock and roll allusions.
1244;So classic that you should have bought it and watched it 5 years ago!
1245;This is probably a great movie for fans who've been watching it since the 80s, but if you're a newbie like me.
1246;parody, but This is Spinal Tap captured the time beautifully.
1247;the film's writers really understand the rock'n'roll world and parody it with much affection:* The chronic problem with changing drummers, especially in hard rock bands* Losing a key member, causing the band to change its musical direction* Managers and record company people having their own agendas* Non.
1248;music videos, lots of great outtakes.
1249;A delicate blend of subtle humor and well couched innuendo that weaves it's way delicately thru this upbeat story of complex characters as they slowly unravel their inner depth.
1250;The film also contains some classic Spinal Tap songs such as We're Gonna Rock You (Tonight), Big Bottoms, Sex Farm Woman, and much more.
1251;Did I like it, no not really, would I watch it again, yes, would I recommend it to you, yes.
1252;You may or may not, it's totally up to you, and I suggest you see it, because who knows, maybe you'll like it.
1253;Go ahead and see it and form your own oppinion.
1254;After all this is a movie that you honestly can't go and see based on others oppinions, because this may or may not entertain you.
1255;JUST KIDDING, this movie rules, it's so funny.
1256;But it's worth remembering just how important, and more importantly how funny, it really was.
1257;stage Stonehenge and the involvement of Christopher Guest's girlfriend in the break up of the band are brilliant moments in the progress of the band and its promotional tour of their new album, Smell the Glove under the eye of their record company boss, Sir Denis Eton.
1258;"this movie is laugh out loud funny done by rob riener or legendary meat head if it was on a scale of 1 to 10 i would have to give this movie 11 ""does that make it better"" ""well yes its one better isnt it"" smell the glove is a great album ""you ask how much blacker could this be and the answer is none"" just see it its funny."
1259;Probably the funniest mockumentary out there!
1260;If you're a music fan it pokes fun at a lot of music tropes and events.
1261;Like deleted scenes, outtakes, i mean real material that realy interest the viewer, and in this cult film's case, THE FANS!Because this cult classic is a matter of real fanatism, we the fans demand all the spinal tap material that we can get hour hands on!
1262;And this special edition brings you all that and more.
1263;It`s not often to find a real cult classic movie in such a fine presentation loaded with such material.
1264;"I enjoyed all the cameos, like Paul Schaeffer as the agent, and Billy Crystal as the mime (""Don't talk back!"
1265;A great take on real world music biz.
1266;The best movie ever made and no one wants to release it!
1267;It gives a wicked nod to Yoko Ono as well.
1268;my two favorite aspects of the movie are the sincerity of the interviewer , and the vacant expression on the lead's face when the interviewer asks about his amplifier.
1269;To me it is like 3 movies in one: the original, the over an hour of unseen footage, and the hilarious audio commentry by Tufnel, St. hubbins and Smalls.
1270;This satirical look at an 80's heavy metal band in demise is the funniest spoof ever filmed.
1271;Where to start with how great this movie is.
1272;The characters are so well written in their flaws that you can't help but continually laugh.
1273;This is still one of my favorite movies of all time.
1274;Superbly executed with quick and witty improv.
1275;I wish comedies were still this good!
1276;Their popularity has diminished and they need to come up with new ideas to rejuvenate the band.
1277;The extras are good as well, with a commentary with the band, out takes and more.
1278;The film itself is an effective comedy/satire of rock n roll bands from the 60's folk to 80's hair metal.
1279;I found the jokes throughout the film set up well, and one joke comes up right after another, with no dull spots, although it is not bust out loud laughing kind of humor.
1280;Fans of metal with a sense of humor should enjoy this.
