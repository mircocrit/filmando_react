id;spiegazione
1;i just love the story line.
2;One day on a field trip his class goes to a laboratory with genetic engineered superspiders.
3;The Spiderman costume for is classic.
4;His abilities are even better:clinging to walls, spraying webs of string from his hand, better jumping capabilities, more strength, faster reflexes, and the special Spidey Sense.
5;During the film, there's a lot of good animation.
6;I was very impressed with all of the effects.
7;If you have seen the comics or just want to tryout a superhero film, I recommend Spider.
8;For it's entertainment value alone, movie enthusiasts who don't necessarily consider themselves Spider.
9;man fans, may actually enjoy the movie more than the hardcore Spider.
10;the movie is a fairly good adaption of the classic comic.
11;Of course, the movie ends leaving you with the impression that there is more to come, so perhaps there's a sequel in the works with more of the classic villians for Spidey to battle.
12;man is one of the better ones out there, if not the best.
13;He seems to be a much stronger adversary than some of the other goofy, wise.
14;man creator Stan Lee and many of the other writers and artists, along with background and history of the comic franchise.
15;goer looking for some entertainment value.
16;slinger sure knows how to give people a good time.
17;This is the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life!
18;Tobey Maguire is soooo hot!
19;I've seen it 6 times and each time it gets better and better.
20;Every single one of them said that they absolutly loved this movie and couldnt stop talking about it.
21;Everyone who thought they wouldnt like it loved it.
22;man is a good movie, and the special effects and all are pretty cool eye candy.
23;But besides, that, it's amazing to see everyones favourite web.
24;If you liked X. men, you'll like this one.
25;This movie was simply perfect from start to finish.
26;I seems like you're only in the theatre for half an hour because it is so entertaining that time flies by so fast!
27;People were so pleased with the movie that they actually applauded at the end.
28;I can't remember the last time a movie that was hyped this much actually surpassed the hype, but Spiderman certainly does just that.
29;The plot seems to do a good job of following what I remember of the comic book plot line, the dialog is comic book in nature but all right( after all it is a comic book not real life) and the special effects seem to do all right by me.
30;i got finished with the movie wanting something more, maybe the next one will do an even better job.
31;the extra's should be a lot of fun to see, if I get it they will be the reason.
32;I think this is the best Super Hero/Comic Book movie ever made so far.
33;thus far, all I've seen with this genre are special effects and action.
34;Superman I, Batman I, and X. men came close to actually having a human, touching story, but not quite there.
35;it is the best so far.
36;First off let me say what a fantastic movie this is.
37;Spiderman has it all, action, humor, and wonderful special effects.
38;Lets face it, something for everyone.
39;Ofcrouse, the super jock also likes her, and wants to make Peter's life miserable.
40;The rest, as they say, is history.
41;Defoe is wonderful as the Green Goblin.
42;He has the perfect mannerism for a bad guy.
43;Kirsten Dunst as MJ was wonderful, full of sweet and innocence.
44;Ofcourse, Toby is perfect for Spiderman.
45;what I liked about this movie is that the lesson that Peter learns.
46;It was a cute touch.
47;I went to go see spiderman the first day it came out, and it was the best movie I have ever seen in my life!!!!!!
48;He is the best marvel hero in the world today and think you stan lee for making him, he rocks the world!!
49;that movie is worth seeing twice and 3 and 4 and 5 times, it is the tightest movie there is in history.
50;(I'll do a review of the Spider.
51;But it is a very informative interview.
52;There's a reproduction of the Amazing Fantasy comic that first introduced Spider.
53;It was clean, had no bad language, and a decent plot.
54;I really like the actors because they were believable.
55;It was pleasant entertainment, so I bought it.
56;Is the love story really compelling?
57;With great Power comes great Responsibility!
58;Plus, the tragic element enters his life when his beloved uncle dies, Mary Jane hooks up with his best friend, and the villain is born by another accident (who by the way, is the father of his best buddy), and suddenly: BANG!
59;Its enormous box office success is enough to shut anyone's mouth.
60;good and accurate photography, an O. k. music score by Danny Elfman, nice editing and some ephemeral moments of decent narration (plus some dry kisses), made this flick a real taster's choice (that is if you are a fan of Gigli and those dump films that Jerry Bruckheimer so often loves to produce).
61;the problem with this kind of films is how easy they can look silly without ever touching their concept with seriousness, the concern is always about looking good in their outfits, the story and its treatment is secondary.
62;man comic in my life, in fact, I never was into comics, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
63;It delivers everything you would expect from any big.
64;You get action, you get dazzling special effects and even a love story to boot.
65;Sure, the movie is predictable, but that's what makes it so great.
66;Sure, I like a lot of cynical films and most of my favorite movies don't have happy endings, but it's refreshing to see a movie that actually feels good to watch.
67;Tobey Maguire is perfect in his roll as Peter Parker, a photography geek who is turned into Spider.
68;His love interest and next door neighbor is played by Kirsten Dunst.
69;Both are perfect for the movie and do a really good job.
70;The plot is very good, I don't know if it actually comes from the comic book, but I thought it was VERY well written and has plenty of plot twists to keep you awake.
71;book freak and I loved it, and I plan on going to see it again while it's still in theaters.
72;This is a good film to watch with kids who have not seen the modern recent version of the brand.
73;Great visual effects, just as speedy (or rather slow) as the matrix.
74;great characters, great plot, great special effects and of coarse great sound editing!
75;This movie is worth watching!
76;It's a film that's appealing to children, teenagers, and adults!
77;It has both romance and humor!
78;Dunst and Maguire are perfect for the role!
79;It's a movie that let's you know how wide an imagination of a director can be.
80;It's a touching story and at the same time a fast action movie that you wouldn't mind watching over and over again!
81;In a way it's like the comic book coming alive!
82;man (and hey she has a song called Mary Jane!)
83;overall it was really worth the wait.
84;It's better than any movie I've watched all summer!
85;The movie packs together a lot of excitement.
86;Just like Lord of the rings it's touching and at the same time exciting (I know I've mentioned this before!)
87;it's a modernized fast creation that could only be imagined as you read the comic books.
88;It's an impressive flick that you should watch if you haven't watched it yet!
89;they are loud and flashy and serve as eye candy for the blind.
90;the movie's lesson:with great power comes great responsibility.
91;man is one of the most popular comic book super heroes of all time.
92;Most of us can associate with feeling like you are living a dual.
93;and still another reason is the romance in the movie.
94;It made it easier for the guys to ask their girls to go watch the movie with them.
95;man is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of all time.
96;Despite initial concerns, Tobey Maguire is very convincing as our conflicted hero.
97;Kirstin Dunst, as always, was excellent, and casting William DaFoe as the Green Goblin was nothing short of brilliant.
98;man comics, including the loves of Peter Parker.
99;I liked this movie But there is something about it that I just can't put my finger on.
100;don't get me wrong, I liked this movie.
101;this movie is made in a very cool way.
102;There is some romance here.
103;Director is really talented man with a great sense of humor.
104;Actors and their characters are wonderful.
105;This is a story about the great battle of light and darkness.
106;When you have a film that's a masterpiece, and then you have special feautures that are a masterpiece.
107;I was also leery of having to pay to see a comic.
108;man is really the intertwined tale of the origins of both Spider.
109;As played by the talented Willem (Platoon) Dafoe, Osborne is a charismatic yet ambitious scientist who wants to get a military contract for a super soldier.
110;With a physical enhancement formula, a technically advanced armored suit, and a neat.
111;o powered glider, this super soldier will, hopefully, give Osborn's OsCorp billions in funding, and establish Norman as a visionary entrepreneur.
112;(This is just one of a few re.
113;the movie is faithful to its sources.
114;man, destined to become the web.
115;In this, what seems to be the first of a hopefully successful franchise, the seeds of conflict are planted in two ways.
116;First, Peter and Harry, who start the film as best friends, compete for M. j's affections.
117;the film, like most adaptations of novels or comics, does tweak certain things to fit into contemporary culture or for dramatic reasons.
118;The fine spidery hairs that form on his hands and fingers to grip walls and surfaces are also new inventions, as are the changes in the timeline (in the movie, Peter and his fellow teens are graduating seniors, where in the comic they were underclassmen).
119;Nevertheless, this movie, like Warner Bros.' 1978 Superman: The Movie, are fine examples of how a comic book hero can make the transition from the printed page to the silver screen.
120;full of extra features, including two commentaries on the feature film disc, branching Web.
121;even if you are not a big fan of comic book movies, this is a good movie to own.
122;This is among the greatest movies I've ever seen in my life, and I have seen quite a few!
123;man is my favorite male comic book character.
124;It was wonderful having the Green Goblin in this movie.
125;His wondrous performance in this movie rocked my world like never before.
126;The acting was perfect, and so was the special effects and the stunts.
127;Oh, and Mary Jane was just as beautiful as she should have been.
128;Oh, and Harry Osborn was pretty funny, in a loose sense of course.
129;Aunt May was absolutely hilarious.
130;Anyway, this movie is as good as they get with the exception of Spidey 2.
131;The only flaw was that the green goblin didn't really look like a green goblin he looked more like a transformer character but I liked it and I will go see it again.
132;I recomend for comic viewers!
133;I bet Spiderman 2 will not be any better, so I suggest to forget about franchise and enjoy GOOD comic book adaptations like .
134;book movie gets it right, as this one does, people should know, especially those who think of going to a big over.
135;But much like Peter Jackson and the initial Lord of the Rings movie, director Sam Raimi gets Spider.
136;That fan's pure devotion coupled with Raimi's considerable directorial flair (remember the Evil Dead movies or A Simple Plan?)
137;makes the movie far better than you might expect.
138;He simply swings though Manhattan's concrete canyons.
139;(Special effects evaluation: very, very good but not always thrilling.)
140;But it is a picture jam.
141;But the picture has an an energy and a self.
142;confidence that give it a terrific movie.
143;even the acting is better than it usually is in this kind of flick.
144;A lot of fuss surrounded his casting: what's the sensitive kid from The Ice Storm and The Cider House Rules doing as a beloved comic.
145;Maguire, with his slightly crooked grin, his mild yet laser.
146;sharp gaze and his crackly, choked.
147;up voice turns out to be the perfect choice.
148;He knows we root for poor, shy Peter as much as we do for Spidey in all his wall.
149;Maguire brings a pensiveness to the part as well a goofy likability and an unabashed intelligence.
150;the best advice Uncle Ben gives to his nephew is With great power comes great responsibility.
151;Sam Raimi knows exactly what that means.
152;Indeed, the action sequences and the special effects rank at the top (for people who complained that the CGI looks cartoon.
153;ish, please refer to the article the film was based on.)
154;With it's history, a more engrossing or engaging characters development should shine as bright as the actions.
155;wise, it surely deserve more stars.
156;The story line was excellent.
157;The fact that they stuck pretty close to the comic book story line was well appreciated.
158;The movie is fun from start to finish, except the very end bothered me a little.
159;I will see it again, at least one more time in the theater.
160;I always liked this superhero movie.
161;I think this one raised the bar for the new crop of genre films we see today.
162;He's a real Spidey fanatic and I had to wake him up at several points throughout the film.
163;The romance aspect of the movie was played out much to much and even the promise of exciting special effects did not follow through.
164;with the absolutely perfect translation of Spider.
165;man's fluidity of motion and poses from the comic to the live.
166;Examine the shots of him leaping from the side of a building, casting a web.
167;You can imagine King Kirby's artwork as snapshots from these sequences.
168;This really IS the comic come to life, and I have to say, Well done, ladies and gentlemen!
169;big names, yes, but also big acting talent.
170;That bodes well
171;it's wonderful when you see a beloved childhood icon treated with care and fondness, and very painful when the producers take a cavalier attitude toward the subject.
172;I love dipping into that nostalgic well, and I hate seeing those memories sullied (Kevin Kostner as Robin Hood.
173;Spiderman is an 'accessible' hero( unlike Superman who is perfect for ex.)
174;to provide a balanced review, I will write that on the plus side, William Dafoe is quite good as Norman Osborn, and is the only one in the cast who plays his role, however lousy, with something approximating true conviction.
175;at this point you may wonder, What did you expect?
176;In other words, it's a perfect example of how Hollywood panders to the lowest common denominator (which keeps getting lower).
177;Those who were raised on video games, live in their Mom's basement with their comics collections, and can't pay attention to stories and characters deeper than a puddle will love it.
178;It was war, love story and special effects feast.
179;man makes for a great movie.
180;tobey Maguire is genius casting.
181;In the lead role, Maguire lets you empathize and sympathize with Peter Parker, which is missing from many other comic.
182;He makes for a great adversary.
183;Stuck in the middle are Kirston Dunst(Mary Jane, the main girl in Peter's life) and James Franco(Harry Osborn, son of Norman and Peter's best friend), both of whom provide great supporting parts.
184;man succeed, is that the script(Well written by David Koepp) and Raimi's touch take the time to develop the characters and make you actually care about them.
185;everything about this movie is top.
186;I thought the movie was packed with some real good action and adventure.
187;Good plot and it stuck to the comics.
188;This movie definately kept my attention, especially in the end when Spidey got hammered by the Goblin.
189;i liked tobey maguires portrayal, his mannerisms and he did an excellent job playing Peter Parker.
190;still it makes for a good popcorn flick.
191;The acting was superbly done, the action in the fighting scenes really captured what Spider.
192;man is, and while the digital scenes were slightly fake the overall image left in your mind is one of utter amazement.
193;It is about ordinary life in which extraordinary things occur.
194;also Tobey was fantastic as Spider.
195;man to life and made both characters believable.
196;Very entertaining flick, even for those that aren't into comic books or super hero's.
197;I thought the special effects and the costumes were all well done.
198;The acting was good and the story basically made sense (although there were a couple of coincidences that were a bit hard to take).
199;This movie is definitely worth watching.
200;on the negative side I felt that it lacked the super Blockbuster appeal that certain movies have that make them watchable over and over again.
201;man II could have been made showing the touching and romantic part of his growing up, the high school sweetheart part of the story, etc.
202;In X. men we just got Wolverine in action, right off the bat, and it plays better.
203;Anyway, the acting was good and I am not being critical of the performances.
204;i recommend this movie, it is fun to watch, but it isn't on my got to own it list.
205;The first costume Peter comes up with for his costume is just hilarious.you'll know what I mean when you see it but the actual costume you see him in for the majority of the movie was just fantastic.
206;i had not followed the comics or cartoons but found the story very easy to follow.
207;I also enjoyed the scene on the rooftop when Peter first tries to use his webbing on command, when he first climbs a wall and his aunt's comment You're not Superman, you know.
208;The scene he does in front of the mirror was quite clever I thought.
209;crawler to life visually, in a stunning fashion.
210;The Green Goblin's motivation is questionable at best, though the strength of Dafoe's performance helps cover this up.
211;cool movie when it first came out in theaders i watched it once but then it came out i watched it like 50 times and i knew that it would be a awesome movie to get it has many features on it oooooh this is a good movie one of my favorite movies ever!
212;Always been a fan of the Spider.
213;This is a very well done movie for Spider Man.
214;I grew up with the Web Slinger and was very thrilled with the movie.
215;it's worth viewing for a Spider Man fan.
216;he) so I inevitably I had to go see this movie with my husband on one of his repeat viewings (My husband, by the way, said they got everything right.
217;I loved this movie and thought it was great.
218;It had great writing, great acting and a great story.
219;Almost every actor cast did a wonderful job, save for JK Simmons, and his over the top portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson.
220;Nevertheless, this movie really hit the spot for me.
221;Cliff Robertson was fantastic, as were all of the other supporting characters, save for perhaps Dunst.
222;comparing and contrasting the two films is fairly straightforward.
223;Without offending the great Martin Sheen, I liked Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben the best of the two.
224;The scenes with him and his Uncle Ben are very dramatic and emotional.
225;I liked them greatly for their depth of emotion.
226;the Amazing Spiderman with Andrew Garfield was a more in.
227;The acting was just as good and I liked the romance between Parker and the cop's daughter more than I did the love triangle that existed with Maguire, Franco and Dunst.
228;yr old is OBSESSED with this movie.
229;He will watch the wrestling scene over and over again.
230;And for the record, he's way more into this series than the new Amazing Spiderman.
231;He was my favorite superhero and I literally obsessed about him.
232;man's origin is inspired yet respectful of the comic series and really lends itself to being immortalized as one of the better superhero movies in recent memory.
233;It tackles Peter Parker's progression from boy to man really well, and while it doesn't have the same emotional weight as the second installment did (probably the best superhero movie of the aughts), it manages to build a solid foundation for what was to come.
234;Maguire is perfect for the role (seriously, the best Peter Parker imaginable) and the rest of the cast also fits very well into their respective roles, with Dafoe effectively evil (the man is just scary to look at) and the divine Kirsten Dunst making a memorable Mary Jane.
235;The special effects are solid, the action is intense and the progression of story takes centerfold in a very respectable way.
236;Raimi certainly perfected his mold with the second film (and then threw it away on the awful third chapter) but what he does here sets us up for a great two part series.
237;So, I felt compelled to watch this film.
238;I really enjoyed this movie.
239;A fun action packed ride.
240;a very accurate and entertaining interpretation of the classic comic.
241;man comic, save one written by a friend of mine, and I've only seen a couple episodes of the TV series, but I am now very interested in them.
242;The story was great, and the effects were stunning.
243;After I saw the movie, I realized that Maguire can play a wide spectrum of characters, and his role as Peter Parker/Spider.
244;Kirsten Dunst was, I thought, good in most ways, but she seemed a little prone to changing her personality.
245;Willem Dafoe was the best, though.
246;He perfectly played Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, with the scenes where he's arguing with himself very believable.
247;Altogether, this was an amazing film.
248;Great movie for the time period.
249;The special effects were amazing and it lived up to it's expectations.
250;The best movie I've seen this year.
251;it's about a high school boy, who is kind of geeky and loves spiders.
252;He turns into the ultimate superhero.
253;Spiderman!It is a classic movie, a must see.
254;Everybody will enjoy this movie, and it is a movie for both kids and adults.
255;I think this is the best superhero action movie since the first Batman back in 1989.
256;I loved the visuals and the character development was superbly done.
257;Overall great story, great movie, and it was even inspirational!
258;Spider man was so cool.
259;the next movie I bet will be better than this one since you might get to see Shadow Cat and Harry as the Villian.You should go see it cause I bet you'll like it.
260;first of all, Tobey Maguire, despite all the criticism he's had, was excellent as Peter Parker.
261;That's why I love him.
262;He simply captured the essence of what Spider.
263;You won't be disappointed, I promise.
264;In spite of all you've done for them, eventually they will hate you!
265;What makes both the original comic and this film so poignant is that this wisdom comes from the VILLAIN.
266;man was and is the most enduring of the Marvel characters because he's not just a hero.
267;he's a very human hero.
268;This made him stand out from all the other Marvel characters, and is the reason he's such an enduring one, especially as he learned the fundamental truth of being a superhero .
269;With great power comes great responsibility .
270;The final confrontation with the Goblin, in particular, was spot.
271;Red hair SO works on her!
272;Norman and the Goblin both played to perfection.
273;Shame on you!Other than that, it's a great flick.
274;By taking itself somewhat seriously, Spiderman proves that a seriously made comic book is both entertaining and rewatchable.
275;In addition to the standard this is how a superhero is made elements, there is a love triangle, a search for a purposeful life, and other pieces which are subtley done.
276;The acting is excellent throughout.
277;That stuff is nice if you're so.
278;Not since the Tim Burton Batman movies have I enjoyed a super hero movie as much as I did 2002's Spider.
279;With a superb cast, well written script and dazzling special effects, this film lives up to the standard set by the first two Superman and Batman movies, a rarity with most of today's super hero movies.
280;man has a well chosen cast (especially Willem Dafoe, who very nearly steals the show as The Green Goblin), dazzling special effects, great direction and a well written script.
281;Some elements I thought were a little convoluted, but overall it was a very good plot.
282;The film's sets were cool as well, very expressionistic.
283;I'm kind of surprised it didn't get any awards.
284;This film is among the greatest superhero movies of all time, and is one a lot of the modern day superero movies should try to beat.
285;A lot of times when a classic cartoon/comic strip is made into a live.
286;man flowed pretty smoothly, and it had great effects that really captured the audience.
287;Oh well, despite the other things I pointed out, this movie still has enough good moments to make it worth your while.
288;The comic art gallery is nice.
289;take I want to see.
290;bathed New York on its cover got me even more stoked for this film.
291;Adding to the weirdness, he's suddenly able to do things he wasn't able to do before: no need for glasses
292;So, like any good teenager with superpowers, he uses them to impress the girl of his dreams, in his case taking on a spider.
293;across the city, Peter has learned that with great power comes great responsibility and so avenges his uncle's death by using his new spider.
294;like powers for good and becomes the Amazing Spider.
295;age movie that made the wait for this flick well worth it.
296;man is definitely an origin movie, something to set the stage for more to come, giving a rich back story and atmosphere not to just Peter Parker's world, but to each of the supporting characters, even J. Jonah Jameson (who J. k. Simmons played brilliantly, by the way).
297;man, you felt like you were there, swinging along with him.
298;My heart bled for the guy.
299;I saw it again in the theatre, going back with the mindset of seeing it for what it was, and I adored it afterward.
300;this was a superhero movie done right, done well and done just plain cool.
301;For what it is, it's just that good.
302;#1: It's a friggin' super.
303;hero movie I've ever seen, both in terms of faithfulness to its source material and simply as a piece of cinema.
304;hero comic, which, fine films that they are, is more than I can say of either Tim Burton's Batman or Bryan Singer's X. men.
305;It's one of the best sf/fantasy films I've ever seen in my life.
306;Hell, it's one of the best films I've seen in the last ten years, of ANY kind (and I've seen A LOT of films in the last ten years).
307;It's a (literally) wonderful parable for our time and, I think, for all time.
308;aw, just go see it.
309;great movie, good price deal, came in no time, good condition, awesome movie recommend anyone to who likes actionand adventure in movies
310;i think Toby was perfect for this movie.
311;but i am happy they are coming out with these.
312;I'll watch this movie AGAIN and AGAIN.
313;This was a pretty good movie.
314;I never really got into the comic book scene and I wasn't interested at all in seeing Spiderman.
315;I'm pretty happy that I did see it though.
316;The acting and storyline were especially good.
317;This movie is full of suspense, action and even a bit of romance.
318;The whole movie on the whole was excellent!!
319;WILLEM DAFOE is also a good partner who defy the hero SPIDER.
320;My oldest son had several favorite movies disappear so I came to Amazon for replacements!
321;Brand new, wrapped in cellophane, perfect!
322;A film based on a superhero is hard as well.
323;It certainly was nice going into this movie to realize that you don't need to know anything to get into it.
324;It's all pretty much laid out for you and you don't need to be a rabid fan or Spider.
325;A nerd who's just kind of there.
326;Enter rich businessman Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe),who is the father of Peter's best friend.
327;Peter's love for the beautiful Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst).
328;Director Sam Raimi is known for smaller films like the Evil Dead trilogy, as well as The Gift, A Simple Plan, and others.
329;He does the job perfectly.
330;man, but he's far more interesting and intriguing as Peter Parker.
331;man, Maguire gets to do fancy stuff and wear a cool costume, but all of the character and charm that Maguire gives us as Peter, quickly goes away once he puts the costume on.
332;Willem Dafoe is a great actor.
333;Kirsten Dunst is well cast as Mary Jane.
334;She has the sweet, pretty girl next door thing down that would make anyone wish she had lived next door to them when they were young.
335;The rest of the cast includes film veteran Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and a small cameo by the great Bruce Campbell.
336;The movie goes by at a pretty nice pace.
337;It keeps going and it's a fun ride.
338;Yes, they were fun and really took you for a ride, but I couldn't get over the fact of how faked it looked.
339;All in all, this is a colorful and fun ride for everyone to enjoy.
340;It joins the rank as good superhero films.
341;It's not in the 'great' catgory like Superman and Batman, but it did what it was supposed to do and it was a lot of fun.
342;Without any doubt, Spiderman is easily known to be the best movie of 2002.
343;It has a good plot and great action scenes.
344;Although things don't go the same way in this movie as they did in the Comic books, it is still a fun Spiderman story to watch.
345;Tobey Maguire did a great job as Peter Parker/Spiderman especially when it comes changing from a nerd to a guy who will beat possibly anybody up and be fearless.
346;This movie had great acting.
347;It is packed with 2 disks and a lot of neat x. tra stuff.
348;And last, he realizes he has the ability to climb up walls and jump like 100 ft high.
349;full Screen or widescreen format (for whichever version you get).
350;e! Hollywood true story on Spiderman.
351;Normally, I've only been a Batman fan, but I found an appeal to this superhero through this movie.
352;I have been a Spiderman fan ever since!
353;This is the best movie of 2002 so far.
354;It was fun and exciting.
355;Maguire and Dunst give great performances, and the ending is superb.
356;In fcat, go see it twice.
357;Spiderman, by any measure, stays more true to the original than any other attempt at bringing a comic book character to the big screen.
358;They have the feel of a comic book, much like certain action sequences in THE other great comics.
359;Yet another comic book hero makes it to the big screen.
360;i was pleasantly surprised when I saw SPIDER.
361;mAN comics in my lifetime), but what you get is so much more than a live action graphic novel.
362;whose secret identity happens to be that of one the man at the local paper he works for, which also assigns him the Spider.
363;Excellent visual effects and a story in which the characters are given a chance to develop without compromising on the expected stunt seqences make SPIDER.
364;mAN one of the best comic book adaptations ever made.
365;I saw the film yesterday and was very impressed.
366;The entire How Peter Parker became Spider Man story worked very well and was extremely effective.
367;The cast was great and I'm sure this movie will make a lot of money.
368;a great start to what I'm sure will be a great franchise.
369;This movie was a lot of fun, and it functioned as sublime escapism, which is probably why I've seen it as often as I have while realizing that the filmmakers tried to cram too much plot into the film and managed to cut short much of the heart needed to make the film a classic.
370;I went to see this movie with my best friend Russell, who was very much so into the comic series, so he helped explain a lot of the things that were confusing me.
371;Spiderman is the thrilling tale of Spiderman's birth, his conflict with his most nefarious villain, the undying Green Goblin, and the film which describes the beginnings of his adult relationships with Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osbourne.
372;This film addresses the ancient myth of absolute good and absolute evil, and shows how these two can sometimes become blurred, but with a strong heart can be distinguished.
373;Spiderman includes some exciting scenes of blood.
374;A romp through the sky.
375;alleys of a modern American city, Spiderman remains one of our contemporary classics which will be remembered as a landmark in the American mythos.
376;Implications: How is Spiderman's understanding of with great power comes great responsibility an example of contemporary American thought?
377;In which ways is Spiderman the hero shown to be a creation of the contemporary age, versus a creation of the 60s, in the film?
378;Realism: America has a long history, not only in comics but in legendary history, of people who take the law into their own hands.
379;Wow, I have to ask those people trashing this movie if they've really read the Spider.
380;man to the big screen, this was Better than you think it was.
381;I went into Spiderman with high expectations for a movie on one of my 2 favorite super heros, directed by one of my favorite directors.
382;Toby Maguire is a perfect adolescent Peter Parker
383;Star Wars Episode II definitely has its work cut out for it, and I don't think there is much chance that the modernized Star Wars will be able to one.
384;see it on the biggest screen possible.
385;Does anyone know what a Five Star movie truly is?Comic book fans definitely have influenced the thinking of the average movie viewer with their rants all across the internet about how excellent this movie is.
386;In reality, it is NOT an excellent film and many need to realize this.
387;Many times during this film I sat there and quietly nodded: They got it right.
388;The effects are very good indeed.
389;Many of the scenes are quite breath.
390;And Cliff Roberston is excellent in his brief but important role as Uncle Ben.
391;With great power must come great responsibility.
392;kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and J. k. Simmons is fantastic as J. jonah Jameson!!!
393;And Sam Raimi proved to me that he's a great director, because only a great director could pull off this movie and make Spider.
394;man realistic by using terrific mixes of real New York street scenes and excellent special effects!!!
395;the good: Willem Dafoe, the editor of The Bugle (forgot his name), and Dunst's legs.
396;Maguire and Defoe are excellent choices as Spiderman and the Green Goblin.
397;And the story was extremelly close to the original comic origin of both characters.
398;Although the film did a nice job of utilizing his web.
399;film movie to date and is most certainly worth watching.
400;I thought it was a bit Hollywood, but anyways a great film.
401;The first film i saw by Sam Raimi was Army of Darkness, which was hilarious.
402;When i saw this though i was very excited.
403;this film has great acting from tobey mcguire, kirsten dunst, and william dafoe from one of my favorite movies Platoon.
404;Although it doesn't follow the comics exactly and modernizes a lot of things, it still manages to keep things drawn out and easy to figure out.
405;although not true to the comics, the relationship is still interesting to watch.
406;Another comic book superhero finds his way to the big screen in this amiable high.
407;J. k. Simmons pays delightful tribute to the original animated program with his boisterous portrayal of Parker's magazine editor, and Rosemary Harris is a delight as Parker's cookie.
408;baking, patient and loving aunt.
409;Look for cameos by Lucy Lawless, Macy Gray and Raimi mainstay Bruce Campbell in one of the film's most delightful sequences.
410;Watching Spiderman was very entertaining eventhough I knew what the story was.
411;Watching it was like watching a tennis match, moving your eyes back and forth, back and forth.
412;Unlike the other comic book to movie ventures, Spiderman stayed very very very true to the comic series.
413;The webslinging scenes and the fight scenes truly made the movie come to life.
414;man (Widescreen Special Edition)~ Tobey Maguire is a brilliant super hero movie.
415;Sam Raimi has written a stupendous script and picked the right actors to be in it.
416;Tobey Maguire is brilliant in the role of Spider.
417;man and Defoe is sublime in the role of the Goblin.
418;Kirsten Dunst is so cute and adorable and the perfect love interest for spider.
419;Great music, well written dialog and action scenes that were action packed and not overly violent.
420;I highly recommend this movie and give it 5 stars.
421;A great movie for those who are new to Spider.
422;The plot is very accurate with few exceptions.
423;I thought the movie was great onscreen and now on TV Screen.
424;The background commentary can be fascinating.
425;man is one of my favorite superheroes of all time.
426;This movie was very well done from start to finish.
427;The story is very heart warming and touching.
428;You connect with the hero so well that its like he really exists.
429;Its rare to find a comic book movie that not only delivers a very good story, but a touching one as well.
430;Unlike another film I just reviewed (Wanted), this movie tells the story of a man that learns that with great power comes great responsibility.
431;setting the wonderful story aside, the rest of the movie falls into place as well.
432;The action sequences are well done and exciting.
433;I loved the soundtrack to this film.
434;The music is original and powerful, and it may give you goosebumps.
435;The acting is very well done in this film as well.
436;While there is no cliffhanger at the end of the film, it successfully is left open to continue future stories.
437;`Spiderman',`Fantastic Four', and `Daredevil' make a very interesting trio of superhero movies, especially as they are, all three of them, based on a Marvel Comics character.
438;These movies are simply made for fun.
439;Enhanced senses following loosing one sense are very real.
440;The genesis of Peter Parker's superpowers is a bit more sci fi, but totally believable, given the chance to believe a genetically enhanced spider species.
441;Most of what you see on the screen is really Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Colin Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics.
442;`Daredevil' also has the added value of at least three very human relationships.
443;`Spiderman' is easily on the top tier of superhero movies, based not only on the believability of the premise and the humanity of the actors, but also on the relatively effortless special effects, lightly applied to great effect.
444;While I never read `DareDevil' or `Hellboy' comic books, I am familiar with the original `Fantastic Four' and `Spiderman' comics, so I think the relative merit of the films has a lot to do with the relative merit of the comics, since `Spiderman' is the traditional champion among strong comic book fans.
445;I should add a plug for performances by Michael Chiklis in `Fantastic Four' for his comic relief and by Ben Affleck in `DareDevil' for taking the role so seriously, possibly through the influence of his good buddy, Kevin Smith, who appears in a cameo role as the medical examiner.
446;This movie is everything I expected, a fine adaptation of a great comic, following the trend of X. men.
447;hero, with strength and agility along with the ability to spray his web wherever he chooses.
448;In the film, Peter's character has a crush on a girl he knew growing up, M. j. M. j. is our `damsel in distress' who is seemingly always in need of help, and has perfected the art of screeching for aid.
449;The panoptical view of the hero, who sees all evil, seems to also see M. j. and focus his life.
450;Overall the film is pleasing to the eye, and allows for critical thinking on how woman are portrayed in movies that mainly focusing on young audiences.
451;Ok, I'm a really big Superman fan first of all.
452;But, I am also a really big superhero fan.
453;LOL I recommend this movie to anyone, it's great for the whole family.
454;This was a good film to just sit back enjoy!
455;Yes, it is a comic book character, but Tobey Maguire was really good in this.
456;I will watch the sequels.
457;Some of my friends which are comic book artists say this is the best comic.
458;book adaptation ever, or even a masterpiece.
459;Although it's better than all Superman movies and recent Batman disasters, it still is what it is: CGI mayhem with some character development (wow!)
460;the script is solid, and waiting for the sequel will be like waiting for the next NBA basketball season .
461;This is compromise for the kids (an understandable one) so it is pretty darn good.
462;Bring the Son of Green Goblin plus antoher great villain and you'll be on our way for Spidey No.3!
463;This movie had almost everything right!
464;Well, it leaves questions for the next one, huh?OK, then, genius, what was so right with it?Acting .
465;Maguire perfectly encapsulates nerdish shyness and superhero charisma (plus, you gotta respect a guy who had to bulk up without meat, so he did it with tofu.
466;Kirsten Dunst managed to pull out a great performance, despite my abject and complete hatred of her.
467;Whoever played JJJ was spot.
468;I am still freaked out by Willem Dafoe's incredible dual.
469;man fans should see this movie.
470;Action movie fans should see this movie.
471;The effects were great, Danny Elfman's music was right on (as usual), and Tobey Maguire really captured the essence of Spider.
472;This was a VERY faithful adaptation of a comic book to the big screen, with a few tuneups for today's generation (the original was written going on forty years ago).
473;That being said, it's great, it's fun, it's positive for younger and older viewers without being TOO campy.
474;Plenty of bonus goodies with a wealth of background for all the special features fanatics.
475;Have fun with it
476;all though, I really enjoyed the movie.
477;I was very suprised on how good the special effects were.
478;If they make a sequal they should make the villian look more realistic.
479;Other than that I thought the movie was great.
480;I thought that Toby Maguire and Kirstin Dunst made a great team.
481;I would recommend this movie to viewers of all ages.
482;A well thought out storyline, well made technically, and a good performance from Tobey Maguire.
483;Cleverly setup for a sequel, which I will most definitely see!
484;man' is simply one of the best comic book superheroes ever to make the leap to the silver screen.
485;It has it all
486;tobey Maguire makes for the perfect Peter Parker (sorry, just had to string those three P's together), timid high school science geek turned powerful, costumed superhero.
487;With the addition of Kristen Dunst in the role of next door neighbor and love interest Mary Jane Watson, James Franco and Willem Defoe as the notorious Green Goblin this is a film that can be viewed and enjoyed again and again!
488;This film definitely stands out as the first blockbuster of the summer.
489;I was definitely impressed with what this movie had to offer.
490;The acting impressed me on all levels.
491;Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst both did extremely well in their roles with Maguire fitting the Spider.
492;the special effects stand out as one of the great aspects in this film and are extremely well done.
493;man comics quite admirably with the Green Goblin storyline and the anticipated emergence of Hobgoblin.
494;But apart from that, it also appealed to those who weren't hardcore fans of the comic book series and was certainly easy to follow if you weren't familiar with the details of Spider.
495;if you didn't truly enjoy this movie, then face it.
496;Definitely one of the most enjoyable super.
497;The directing was well done, the plot was excellent, good acting, great effects.
498;As a lifelong comic book super.
499;Seeing the transition from comic book to film performed so well in this case, however, is remarkable, from the special effects to the writing and even some of the inside jokes meant strictly for the comic book fans (we know who we are).
500;While it is not a literal translation of each and every comic book, it does capture the essence of who he is and what he represents.
501;This movie may have seemed to take forever to make, but it was certainly well worth the wait.
502;Especially a Spider Man comic reader, this movie follows the comic entirely and well!
503;He's stronger, faster, more resilient, and he shoots webs out of his wrists, climbing skyscraper walls with the greatest of ease.
504;door love, Mary Jane Watson, is going out with his best friend Harry Osborn.
505;one that will turn him into the scourge of New York City and Peter Parker's arch.
506;Maguire is credible and likeable as Peter, he just doesn't have much fire until he's got the Spider.
507;The rest of the cast are fine, some even superb .
508;for a single example, Cliff Robertson is wonderful in the small but important support role of Peter's Uncle Ben.
509;director Sam Raimi is an experienced hand at this kind of movie, and keeps it moving pretty well.
510;looking costume and props of the Goblin are really incredible, and fortunately are very well.
511;not a perfect movie, but a damn good one.
512;by the way, the novelization of this film is really terrific .
513;Having wondered how some of the tricks of the trade were handled and some shots were filmed with all the special effects, I really enjoyed the commentaries available on the audio tracks, as well as the spidey pop.
514;ups really told me some quite interesting facts about the movie and not just all the technical mumbo.
515;rom portion on it are quite cool as well, being able to record your own commentary.
516;This movie is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a comic book that I have ever seen.
517;kirstin Dunst is outstanding as Mary.
518;jane Watson, Peter Parker's long time love interest.
519;She shows a wide range of emotion in this film, from joy, elation, and happiness to fear, grief, anguish, and sorrow.
520;the rest of the cast accurately portray their roles, from irrascible publisher and noted nemisis of Spider.
521;man, J. Jonah Jameson, to Norman Osborn's unappreciated and troubled son, Harry, to Peter's beloved Aunt May, the comic that entertained me since I was five years old comes to life in a way I'd only dreamed about.
522;the special effects are well done, too.
523;But these details are to make the movie flow more smoothly, and only readers of the comic will notice them anyway.
524;I am a huge fan of Spider.
525;man comics and this movie doesn't disappoint.
526;This movie is my favorite comic book movie of all time.
527;In fact this is one of my favorite movies of all time (in the big budget blockbuster genre at least).
528;Raimi's directing is top notch.
529;here we go again an awesome comic book hero turned into a movie.
530;But this movie is rather good.
531;A rather unique phenomena in the movie field.
532;Well I think that it deserved all the credit that it got for being good.
533;well you know the rest, Spiderman and the Green Goblin face off in a big fight.
534;It is pretty big and sweet, so watch this movie if you want to I recommend it greatly.
535;I love the movie and the service was great.
536;The best seller I came across so far.
537;The Joker laughs horrifically and has a split personality.
538;Hey Stan (Lee), this is definitely a brand echh movie.
539;This will give you a fair and true description of the movie and its characters and will give you my personal opinion of the movie which should help you make an informed decision on whether to watch this film for the first time or whether to stay away like you have already done for six years.
540;the Characters:Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was a genius choice to make and at the time he was chosen, Tobey was very much an unknown actor but he's now an A. lister and it's thanks to his stellar performance as the troubled Peter Parker.
541;kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane was again a genius choice of casting as the chemistry between the two was something inspirational.
542;signed as the main characters.
543;man character is Marvels greatest creation and the mainstream success of this movie would not dispute that in the slightest.
544;Personally I loved this film, the action sequences between Spidey and the Goblin are intense and something that although they're minimal they get the job done in establishing the characters and the story.
545;The relationship between MJ and Peter is at times heart wrenching as you first see that Peter is starting to win her over then when he saves her as Spidey she's won over by him.
546;This is a really good movie that gives us a great blend of both character development and action.
547;It takes a completely fantasy element like an average man getting superpowers and puts it in the real world setting with real characters that people can relate to, this is something Stan Lee set out to do when originally creating the spiderman character and this is something that is carried on with the movie.
548;This is the hit that got spider man going again.
549;I've watched this film at least a dozen times and it's still a good ole flick to keep your interest.
550;The cast was fantastic bringing human emotion to what could have been a dumb effects.
551;This movie had great pacing and detailed characterizations.
552;the special effects were very dynamic if at times a bit cartoonish.
553;the bonus features are worthwhile and this is a must own for fans of the character, the genre, or general fans of action films.
554;its my 2nd favorite movie(my first is edward scissorhands) tobey maguire is great in it, and so are all the other actors/actresses.
555;The Acting was Perfect, The effects were very well done.
556;The Costumes Were Very Cool.
557;I Believe That Everyone Who Is A Fan of The Comic Book Should See This Movie.
558;for first im a big fan of spider.
559;I was very plesed with the movie that sam raimi brought to the big screen.
560;this movie was exciting from the momment it started.
561;as William Dafoe did a good job of playing the role of the green goblin.
562;the fight scenes were really good between the the super hero an the vilian.
563;all and all this is a movie i recemmend for all ages from kids to adults
564;man but I have always enjoyed the cartoon and the few comics I have picked up.
565;I liked how the Rami put in the wrestling, just like Peter Parker in the comics.
566;toby was an excellent Spider.
567;man, very convincing as a person who is shy and sticks to himself.
568;Although they were not necessarily realistic looking they were pleasing to the eye and kept you at the edge of the seat.
569;It keeps changing between the two males talking to each other and then to the two females talking to each other.
570;the feature showing Spidey's rogues' gallery was excellent, with brillant 3.
571;also of interest is a feature showing the 4 main love interests of Spidey's.
572;best of all is the 30.
573;minute documentary of Spidey in the 21st century.
574;But now, after years removed from it's opening, and as my knowledge of the comic books this movie was based on grows, I find myself liking this movie more and more.
575;It trades in emotion for fun.
576;The real beauty of this origin really can't be observed without a knowledge of the source material.
577;But once you are familiar with said material, it's quite astonishing.
578;There are some changes to be sure.
579;That aside, SM1 does an amazing job of bring Spider.
580;man's original, comic book origin to the screen.
581;But he definitely does a good job, and while its not the best performance of his career (Seabiscuit receives that honor), he does give an admirable effort that leaves little room for complaints.
582;Willam Dafoe also gives a stand.
583;Dafoe injects his usual creepy demeanor into the character, and while, like Maguire, it isn't the best performance of his career, it is noticeable and memorable.
584;I've also come to appreciate acting of both Rosemary Harris as the caring Aunt May and the campy brilliance of J. k. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson.
585;I've always thought Dunst was a fairly capable child.
586;While they aren't the best effects in the world by any means, they're acceptable, and overall, the actions are quite well done.
587;Probably the best actions scenes in a superhero movie up until that point, in fact.
588;While, positively, this makes the film extremely fun and easy to watch and rewatch, it also kills any and all possibility of it every being a great film, an epic film.
589;man is indeed a wonderful popcorn flick that nearly everyone can enjoy.8/10
590;The movie was really good!
591;The storyline was really good.
592;The considerable promise for the comic book feel that former horror director Sam (Evil Dead) Raimi showed with his gonzo action thriller Darkman comes to fruition in what can be considered the best comic book movie adaptation since Superman, The Movie way back in 1978.
593;The story to it is good and the acting is equally good.
594;You want a good action film this is one of the good ones.
595;I have always been a Spiderman fan so I was pleased when they finally decided to make a movie out of the character.
596;This movie is a lot of fun and true to the comic book hero.
597;The actors and actresses play their roles well, and the movie holds your interest throughout.
598;Even people who are not big comic fans will like this movie.
599;You must see this movie!
600;It is one of the best action movies i've ever seen.
601;^_^ I recommend this to anyone who loves Spider.
602;man or just loves good wholesome family oriented films.
603;ps: Toby Maguire is hot!
604;She loves it, she stays glued to the screen and really gets into it.
605;i became in love with it, I wanted to watch it again and again.
606;alot of high flying stunts, I could tell u that.You dont have to be a Spiderman fan to watch this, the movie is worth watching.
607;I totally love this movie!
608;The hero, the damsel in distress, the bad guy, all make this a true comic brought to life.
609;This is a great adventure/love story.
610;This was a good movie with lots of great special effects and action sequences.
611;type movies you'll really enjoy this family oriented movie.
612;I would recommend this movie.
613;his vision normalizes, he gains superhuman strength and speed, he's able to sense approaching danger and to shoot sticky webbing from ducts on his wrists.
614;Of course, the best part of the film are the effects, which are splendid, especially the sequences in which Spidey is seen swinging through the topless towers of New York by his webbing.
615;give them an added dimension that will make the movie enjoyable by more than just the classic teen.
616;time members of the Mighty Marvel Marching Society will delight in its accuracy, and strangers to the Marvel Universe will be provided with a tight and fascinating introduction to it.
617;James Cameron, the unsung movie director of Alien movie sequel .
618;douglas who'd play the part of Peter/Spiderman, but it turned out good.
619;Good AEROSMITH theme rendition though.
620;It had lots of action and comedy rolled into one, which was great to see.
621;tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, James Franco and Rosemary Harris were great and portrayed their characters in an excellent way.
622;man was well done and will leave you wanting more.
623;It's worth seeing over and over again!
624;Back in the 70's when Marvel tested the TV waters, I thought how great it was.
625;times change and if you happen to see the televised Spidy, look closely at the wire running up the building and his hands and feet not even touching.
626;a true mar. vel indeed!
627;did I really begin a sentence with with.
628;in any event, what a great movie with respect to depth of characters, emotions and really great special effects which do not over shadow the storyline or interfere with interaction between the cast of characters.
629;Peter is actually Best Friend to the Scientist Billionaire Son (James Franco).

637;This is all thanks to Sam Raimi, since he knew, the way.
638;It's Well Made and also Memorable Flick.
639;the special effects are awesome!
640;i really hope they come out with a sequel to this excellent movie!effects: 5 .
641;heart stopping cool animation and effects make you wish for one day you could be spider man!acting.
642;all the actors did an excellent job.
643;i really hope they make a sequel.
644;All I can say is.
645;Great special effects with an outstanding plot and not too mention some totally funny scenes.
646;man fan, I was very pleased with Sam Raimi's faithful interpretation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's character, and his world.
647;The writing couldn't have captured the spirit of the comic any better, and the casting was truly inspired.
648;man brought the best of the series to the screen without needless changes aimed at marketing to a broader audience.
649;Defoe is one of Hollywood's greatest modern faces, he can convey a broad range of emotions simply by changing the expression on his face.
650;There is good reason that Spider.
651;man is one of the most popular characters in the Marvel Comics universe.
652;man is a fully developed character with depth and background.
653;both of which (in the proper context) make him a believable, relatable character.
654;as is appropriate for this movie (the first movie in what will hopefully be a long franchise), Director Sam Raimi takes the first quarter of the picture to create the core character of Peter Parker, and document his transformation into Spider.
655;It's a lesson that Raimi successfully interweaves through the rest of the picture (and one that will continue into the second movie, Spider.
656;raimi has done an unparalled job of bringing the comic universe Spidey inhabits into the real world streets of New York City.
657;Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider.
658;man
659;Commentary by Raimi, Dunst and others is extremely interesting and fun to hear
660;up commentary contains unusual tidbits that are also worth exploring.
661;ups can also link to the excellent Spider.
662;man, you'll love this film.
663;If you've never heard of him, this is a great way to gently ease into the mythos of this extremely popular character.
664;It is the regualr widescreen edition + Stan Lee's Mutants, Marvels, and Monsters, and the Spider.
665;The acting is adequate for a summer movie (though Willem Defoe rocks), and the effects are good (also expected for a summer movie).
666;spidey is done true by this big screen, special effects fest.
667;if you ever enjoyed a read of your Spiderman comics (particularly as originally created without the unusual bio.
668;You'll enjoy seeing something as outrageous as a teenager swinging through midtown manhatten.
669;man on the big screen in a serious modern.
670;the casting was one of the best jobs that I've seen.
671;Kirsten Dunst has really come into her own over the last couple years and has the potential to become a very serious leading lady.
672;And even the small supporting roles added to the movie.
673;It's a well constructed story of how a simple kid grows to become the city's newest superhero.
674;Peter Parker aside, William Dafoe's character and his transformation into the new super.
675;Dafoe's collapse from the top of the corporate world was explained very well and acted beautifully.
676;egos and the way all four personalties interact with each other.
677;All in all, the movie is a well paced action flick with a little bit of love story thrown in.
678;As far as the other superhero turned movie star, nothing can come close to Tim Burton's Batman and the entire Superman series is phenomenal for the time period that they were made in.
679;Compared to X. men of a couple years ago, Spider.
680;Plot.9 (well constructed story, well in tune with the comic)2.
681;Atmosphere.10 (well constructed scenes as well as Danny Elfman's music is a big plus)5.
682;Cinematography.9 (excellent all around effects with a few minor glitches)6.
683;Replay Value.9 (well worth seeing twice)8.
684;I also have never been a huge fan of comic books either.
685;I went on opening night and it was great.
686;Also the special effects added to a great story.
687;I have seen all the other movies based on comic books, but this was by far the best.
688;But, that's besides the point, the point is that this is a great film and the second one alike.
689;I loved Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in their roles as Peter Parker and the girl next door.
690;This was an epic movie that covered a lot of ground in Spiderman's early life, explaining how he got to be what he became.
691;what I like most of this movie is the depiction of Spidey's city, New York with touches of Chicago and made in a fantasyland of good people and some hardcore villains.
692;My least favorite dimension was surprisingly a good part of the action and special effects.
693;And his movie is bar none the best comic book movie.
694;It has his best enemy as well.
695;When I saw this movie the first time, I almost cried because the effects are that good.
696;The cinematography is something to behold.
697;Definitely, the best comic movie ever.
698;This is the best bigscreen adaptation of a major comic superhero that I've seen, much better than the chaotic messes of Burton's Batman films (though I thought Michael Keaton was excellent as Batman).
699;Tobey Maguire's characterization of Peter Parker/Spiderman is perfect, though I do hope he doesn't get limited to the role, since he is probably the best Hollywood male actor of the twenty.
700;up violence in that sort of goofy but sadistic cult director way (as does Peter Jackson in Lord of the Rings), but overall this is a serious action hero movie that manages to have some fun.
701;Its great because it's the first one with Tobey Maguire, but with the new Spider.
702;man movie out I can see this becoming a relic in our home.
703;Thank you, the movie works great, thank you for sending it to me.
704;The best part about it?
705;I have loved Spiderman since my youth and this was a great film adaptation.
706;This was a good movie and it stayed with the comic book.
707;I still enjoyed this movie.
708;man then you will enjoy it too.
709;Sam Raimi was the best choice for director for Spider.
710;man mural painted on his wall for him in his childhood, and he had the perfect vision for how Spider.
711;Better actors could not have been picked to play these roles
712;Kirsten Dunst was an excellent Mary Jane, and Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were the best as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
713;top performance was superb, but the armored costume took some getting used to.
714;Right from the start, the characters are believable, and the characters are fleshed out wonderfully from the comic.
715;A great deal of time was invested in getting a costume for Spidey that looks awesome
716;The talents involved with the CGI captured Spider.
717;rOM extras are a nice bonus, from Marvel dot comics to an Activision Spider.
718;I would have liked to see some deleted scenes, but disc 2 provides some outtakes and gags which are a delight to see.
719;It finally took a true, talented Spider.
720;man fan to turn out the best Spidey production I've ever seen.
721;man, I can definitely say that this is up there with Superman with the comic.
722;Tobey Maguire makes a great choice to play Spider.
723;Some may think he's an odd casting choice, but I think he's perfect.
724;I loved there was actually a section on the comic book
725;Peter Parker's relationship with his sweet aunt and uncle is touching and his love for Mary Jane is in no way possessive or sexualized.
726;This may sound corny, and in many ways it is, but it's refreshing to see in a superhero movie.
727;Writer David Koepp has a cheesy sense of humor, and many of the dramatic scenes come of as histrionic, but the terrific cast keeps these elements in check.
728;He's awkward and tender, yet handsome and virile.
729;Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is just as fantastic.
730;door cuteness and is greatly effective as the damsel often in distress.
731;J. k. Simmons is the perfect money.
732;Director Sam Raimi, who previously worked on the superhero film Darkman, was very well.
733;Raimi has a very stylized and precise camera technique, one that is match.
734;made for the kind of swooping and constantly moving story of Spider.
735;This film rightly puts the characters first and the visual spectacle second, a tip many of the latest generation Marvel film producers could take.
736;I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of Spider.
737;The story has a love base with Kirsten Dunst
738;I loved the hero then and I loved him in this movie.
739;most of the acting is good.
740;He does well at portraying Peter's shy, picked on life at school, and then his transformation to a more confidant superhero.
741;a well done, convincing computer game, but still a computer game.
742;with some decent action scenes and good acting, this movie is fairly good, but not the dream film.
743;I was able to find it on Amazon.
744;Great place to find older movies.
745;I give it three thumbs up.
746;It has commentary by the director and a lot of behind the scenes things to watch.
747;spiderman was a neat movie.
748;It has a cool lovestory with Peter Parker and Maryjane.
749;But the best part is all the cool special effects.
750;Spiderman swings all over the city just like Tarzan.
751;its also full of funny jokes, like Spiderman's first outfit.
752;He starts as a wrestler, and has to make a suit out of sweatshirts and stuff.
753;Spiderman also makes fun of the bad guy, Green.
754;Spiderman learns a lesson when he lets a crook escape.
755;He becomes a well rounded superhero because he can be both funny and sad.
756;This was a perfect superhero film.
757;It was exciting the right places, emotional in the right places, and, yes, cheesy in the right places.
758;It has the wonderful Tobey Maguire in the lead role, who is more believable as Peter Parker than as Spider.
759;also in attendance in Willem Dafoe, giving a wonderful scenery.
760;The mirror scene is a highlight of the film.
761;the special effects were a little distracting at times, especially during the discovery of powers scene, and the film could have been a tad shorter, but I had a great time and would probably watch it again.
762;That Sam Raimi was the right director for Spider.
763;inspired Darkman) boded well for success.
764;With such a director at the helm, and with Spider.
765;enemy Green Goblin, here played by Willem Dafoe, who does an admirable job personifying the villain even though half the time we can't see his face.
766;driven action from an otherwise male cast.
767;hopefully Raimi allows himself and his characters to loosen up as the series progresses.
768;ish documentaries on the making of the film and on bringing Spidey to the big screen.
769;There are some neat comic.
770;The commentary featuring Sam Raimi and others is entertaining and informative.
771;all, a solid debut for what promises to be a long.
772;he made a pretty good spidy but Peter he did not.
773;Full of action and the right format of the first ever comic of Spidey.
774;Amazing effects and camera angles used in this movie
775;Personally, I thought it was great that they decided to do a live.
776;action is always better, mainly though because the films looks more real.
777;if you've ever read the comic books and saw the show, then you've probably got a good idea on what this movie was all about.
778;It's also about how Peter Parker (played perfectly by Tobey Maguire) came to be Spider.
779;There's a lot of action and spin.
780;episode II, Attack of the Clones was a better film, Spider.
781;man was still awesome and worth seeing, but basically because I am a bigger Star Wars fan than Spider.
782;man because I heard it was a good movie and I'm really into sci.
783;Plus, I also think Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor (but Hayden Christensen in Star Wars is hotter, and I believe, more talented!)
784;man, the special effects were amazing and a great touch to the film.
785;The acting was superb, including the performances by the supporting roles.
786;man will be nominated for a few Oscars next year.
787;because there are a lot of excellent fantasy films out there that the Oscar judges overlook, come Oscar time!
788;Sam Raimi did an excellent job with the directing.
789;And Danny Elfman provides a wonderful, haunting score.
790;Elfman is no John Williams or James Horner, but he does a good job in his own right.
791;man is an awesome film and should be seen by all fans of Spidey!
792;I wouldn't really recommend it for very young children, but I think it is appropriate for people ages 7 and up.
793;man is a witty wise cracker?
794;man / Green Goblin action and the effects are pretty good.
795;man costume is spectacular it's everything I always imagine the live action costume would be.
796;But I still love the bridge fight and especially end fight where the Green Goblin basically smokes Spider.
797;man is fun but vastly under potential to what a great comic and Spider.
798;She's a good actress, and she got stuck with this.
799;I remember when this film was first released, the immediate buzz and praise it received, and the expression on my face after the credits began to roll.
800;I was in utter awe, and rightfully so.
801;man' marks the beginning of the `serious' superhero film, the film that's more about plot and relationships then about high adrenaline action sequences (although they are here in large heaping amounts).
802;Sam Raimi and David Koepp brought to life one of the most revered and beloved comic book heroes and did so brilliantly.
803;first smart move was the casting choices.
804;Tobey Maguire was a genius choice for Peter Parker.
805;He plays this role perfectly.
806;Kirsten Dunst was also a wonderful pick for Mary Jane Watson, Peters love interest.
807;Willem Dafoe finally impressed me, mostly because the role of Norman Osborn (the Green Goblin) just seems like the role he was born to perform, and James Franco is good as Harry, Norman's son, although he (it this film at least) is more background noise.
808;the second smart move was making this a much more `bright' superhero film.
809;man' is almost a happy film.
810;It never falls into camp, like the horrid `Batman and Robin', but it keeps things on the up and up, cheery and.
811;Yes I know it deals with issues like the death of Peter's Uncle Ben and the psychosis of a said crazy Green Goblin, but the action and animation is done in such bright, crisp way that the mood is never heavy and never detracts from the enjoyment of the film.
812;the third smart move was taking the time to really develop the main characters and explain the origin of Spider.
813;much' information, but giving us a perfect balance.
814;By the end of the film you truly care about Peter and his plight.
815;He's more than just an action.
816;man' will probably be remembered as the first of the `great' superhero movies.
817;Finally a superhero film was taken serious, was worked and brought to cinematic perfection, not taken lightly and thrown together, but molded into a great movie.
818;one that everyone can and should enjoy!
819;I haven't seen this in a decade, so when it came on sale I got it.
820;This was after seeing the new TASM, which I really liked.
821;I wanted to see how this film held up, and in my opinion it's held up very well and is still very entertaining.
822;It was hard to enjoy because my grandson was so upset.
823;this movie was an amazing tranlation of the comics.
824;with the help of the original creator of the comics, who also created the X. men comics, i think they pulled off a wonderfull and timeless movie.
825;the acting was overall alright and the action was great.
826;done action flick of a movie, and I've always liked Tobey McGuire since I saw him in the movie ``Pleasantville''.
827;I recommend people give this movie a try, and certainly they won't be disappointed at the prices it's selling for now.
828;The movie seems a bit on the long side, but this is actually a good thing.
829;This is a very emotional film, and I appreciate Raimi's focus on Spider.
830;man fights to keep a positive swing (pun intended) on things.
831;shooters can go on for ages it works well with the film.
832;In this film you see Spider.
833;The tragic hero manages to keep a smile on his face and spout witty remarks just the same.
834;The best part of the movie is how real the characters felt.
835;It is hard, but not impossible to get a human to move that way.
836;The effects are the only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect score, because this could have otherwise been the best comic to film adaptation of them all.
837;This movie is a five star film in a three star package, and that's what holds it back.
838;But I always had reservations about some parts of the Spider.
839;Later in the comic that very same robber breaks into Peter's house and murders his Uncle Ben.
840;when I read about the talent behind this movie I was excited.
841;Sam Raimi has impressed me ever since Evil Dead 1, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were also perfectly cast.
842;The romance between them is the most stirring part of the movie.
843;There are parrellels to Superman.
844;this film has some great acting and humorous, stylish direction with a few visual cues lifted from the Batman and Superman movies which feel more like homages than rip.
845;the plot is a basic origin/first adventure narrative.
846;another refreshing elemnt of this movie is that the origins are kept seperate, unlike so many other super hero movies where the villains and the heroes are involved in creating each other.
847;They spent that much time on the special effects to make certain the the flying scenes looked realistic.
848;thankfully the human element of the movie saves the day, keeping it compelling to allow me to suspend my disbelief through these more awkward special effects sequences.
849;Spiderman is probably one f the best movies I have seen in agood while.
850;It is a great mix of action, romance, action, and drama.
851;he is a great actor.
852;The special affects are just plain and simpley absoulutely beautiful!
853;just perfect:1) The movie itself.
854;The look and feel of the settings, the choices of shots, the comic book feel, and editing are top notch.
855;He manages to draw out the best in the characters and the actors who play them.
856;The characters are real and people you can identify with.2) Casting and acting.
857;Fans groaned at some of the casting choices, but the actors were perfect.
858;Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker is magnificent, capturing the difficult inner conflicts of the character.
859;The final scene in which his inner dialog plays out perfectly matches the subtle expression changes on his face.
860;Kirsten Dunst was a concern for me as Mary Jane, but brought a lively interpretation to the role.
861;And Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were spot on perfect as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
862;It's crisp and lively with a host of additional features.
863;one from the directing team and one from the visual effects team, background on the Spiderman comic book (villains, loves, etc.), and some outtakes and screen tests.
864;Best of all, the movie itself is true to the comic.
865;That these were so seamless speaks well of the effects crew.
866;Great to watch and kept us all glued to the screen.
867;man is a great movie and a great starting off point for a whole slew of movies.
868;i like this movie the best out of all the spider.
869;its great for kids to watch and has a little of everything in it.
870;humor, a love story the villian so much.
871;spiderman is a great movie for everyoe!!!!
872;I have loved Spiderman since I first discovered him through th cartoon series of the late 70s/early 80s.
873;this movie does a great job of transporting me back to that time in my youth.
874;The attention to detail in the special effects and the overall appearence of this movie is amazing.
875;The characters are dynamic and interesting.
876;The action is fast paced, well done and exciting.
877;The film really makes you feel as if you were there with Peter Parker.
878;Willam Defoe is perfect as the Green Goblin .
879;Action, love, good vs evil and a plot!!
880;man comics since I was 3 years old, so I had great expectations for Sam Raimi's film adaptation.
881;I'm happy to say that I wasn't let down.
882;tobey maguire stars as high.
883;school science nerd Peter Parker, who is bitten by a genetically altered spider and finds himself with the ability to cling to walls, make tremendous leaps, sense danger, shoot webs, etc.
884;A personal tragedy teaches him that With great power, comes great responsibility.
885;The strength aspect works, but the added bonus is the addition of another personality: The murderous Green Goblin, who takes it upon himself to dispose of Norman's enemies.
886;man with a HUGE grin on my face
887;fans will appreciate the fact that Raimi delivers a rock.
888;solid action movie without resorting to the usual comic.
889;Raimi regular Bruce Campbell is hilarious as the Ring Announcer in the wrestling sequence, and Kirsten Dunst shines as love interest Mary Jane Watson
890;My only beef with the film is the Goblin's mask: It's immobility is kind of jarring when Dafoe is talking.
891;man is, in my opinion, the best Comic Book movie EVER, bar none!
892;Was great in the theater, and my sons now enjoy it in our living room!
893;A lot can be said for the film because it appealed not only to nerds and geeks, but to the mainstream movie.
894;Tobey McGuire may not have been the perfect choice, but he gives a great performance as the title character, which I can't say for Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe.
895;i must say that they did a fantastic job on teaching the audience on how Peter Parker began his journey onto becomming Spiderman, the movie also did a great job on making the movie feel like a Comic Book come to life.
896;Spiderman fans will want to see it tons of times as everyone else will still most likely enjoy it.
897;It should have developed the characters more, since it is obviously set up for a sequel.
898;Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane the beautiful young women who Peter Parker was in love with since the third grade.
899;As the stories goes Peter Parker is living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
900;He finds himself wanting to get the girl of his dreams and yet doesn't know how.
901;When Parker is out starting to go home he finds a crowd with cops and he makes his way through and finds his uncle shot on the ground.
902;This is where you see a great chase scene.
903;The green goblin's son is friends with parker and is dating the Mary Jane.
904;the whole movie is very well done and not over romanced and all the roll playing of the characters was very well done.
905;I would highly recommend this movie to those who have and have yet not read the comic books.
906;This is a movie for everyone.
907;The new movie Spiderman proves how Hollywood over.
908;kill can squash any sense of fun found in the adventures of comic book heroes.
909;Spiderman has none of Burton's macabre or Richard Donner's (director of 1978's Superman) sense of fun and tongue in cheek homage.
910;Spiderman is the perfect summer movie.
911;It features a well known hero, played by a talented, well known actor and has a very good supporting cast.
912;Toby Maguire is excellent as the smart but nerdy Peter Parker and doubles perfectly as the beefed up, super cool Spiderman.
913;Toby Maguire has shown us what a good actor he is in films like Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules so it is great to see him in an action film where he can let loose and just have fun.
914;Kirstin Dunst is good as Peter's sexy but elusive love interest and Willem Dafoe is delightfully demented and evil as the Green Goblin.
915;With the origin of Spidey out of the way and introducing Peter Parker's character, the next movie should be able to move completely forward into non.
916;Regardless, this is well worth the wait.
917;If you a superhero film, action buff, or just love lots of colorful movie making, go see Spiderman.
918;it turned out to be a pretty good movie.
919;What kind of movie is Spider.
920;summer 2002, millions of die.
921;hard Marvel comic fans were treated to seeing one of their heroes come to life on the big screen.
922;man draws a distinct line between good and evil.
923;From a purely secular standpoint, the movie is excellent, with its dazzling special effects, allowing us to see and swing along with Spider.
924;The relationship between Peter and Norman Osborn is especially interesting.
925;Harry Osborn, Peter's friend, tells Peter at the end that Spider.
926;For those who know what to be on guard for, it's a great watch.
927;Whatever life has in store for me, I will always remember these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.
928;This is my gift
929;He has his climbing burrs on his hands covered!SPIDER.
930;it was really deep and very sweet.
931;man 2 filled in the blanks from the first film, therefore, this film should be seen in conjunction with the second for a more rewarding experience.
932;man does a terrific job in exploring the origins of Peter Parker's evolution to the legendary web.
933;Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spider.
934;Kirsten Dunst is fetching as Mary Jane Watson.
935;This character truly comes into her own in the second film.
936;It was good to see an old hand like Cliff Robertson deliver a solid turn as Uncle Ben.
937;For a novice like myself this was a satisfying viewing experience.
938;spiderman is great cartoon for any kid to watch.
939;man is the best superhero movie out side of Batman.
940;man and Dc Has A hit with Batman.
941;Oh, Man one of the best spider.
942;Man william Dafoe did an excellent job at his part as the Green Goblin.
943;Director Sam Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp have gotten it just right.
944;man is light, humorous, and filled with action and thrills.
945;The major characters from the comic are brought to life by the fine cast.
946;unlike many, I thought that the CGI effects worked well.
947;This is absolutely perfect, for the teenager still inside me, who comes out to play occasionally.
948;This is as good as thePeter Brook's The Mahabharatafor me.
949;Spiderman is epic the plot is awesome the setting sweet the Charactors are just like they are supposed to be portrayed in the Spiderman Comics.
950;my favorite actor in this film is Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane.
951;Wow is she hot and she does a great job staying true to her charactor.
952;this is one of the best superhero movies out there bar none.
953;nerd that has a tough time making new friends and getting girlfriends.
954;all that will change when he gets bitten by a spider that gives him amazing SuPERPOWERS beyond his Wildest dreams.
955;this is a nice long well done movie that is so fantastic and epic i cant even begin to imagine how hard it must have been for the directors and crew to get this film to be as special as it is.
956;so Sam Raimi Directs this great film and boy does he do a great job staying true to the comic books and bringing Spiderman to life at last on the big screen.
957;i used to be fascinated by his *great* moves and *funny* one.
958;sam Raimi did a terrific+amazing+wonderful job at directing this film.
959;and there's Mary Jane, the love of his life.
960;lot of people thought that Tobey Mcguire was GOOD but not GREAT, some mentioned that he shouldve got bigger and buffer.
961;i personally thought Kirsten Dunst was great.
962;she is such a talented actress, who is very versatile.
963;i believe she has a potential to beocme one of the greatest actress of all time.
964;dafoe, is a very amazing actor as well, his facial expressions were simply out of this world, i thought he did not even have to speak his lines.
965;once again, very well made, i suggest everyone go see it and rate it for themselves.
966;time favorite comic book superhero.
967;Because I didn't think I could bear to see the mutilation of another comic hero, ala Batman and Superman.
968;Probably the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation out there, and one of the best action/adventure movies that has graced the silver screen.
969;One of the reasons this movie has such a wide appeal, is that Spider.
970;He struggles to fit in just like the rest of us do.
971;He's human, and uses all his resources unselfishly in trying to help others.
972;man does and will succeed as a movie franchise.
973;If they stick to the comic books, Peter has some of his greatest challenges ahead.
974;He struggles to win the affections of Mary.
975;man's greatest villians and battles lie ahead (which eventually destroy his marriage to Mary Jane.)
976;head will enjoy a long and entertaining movie career.
977;man is the epitome of a summer action flick.
978;It doesn't have wonderful acting or a wonderful script, but it is interesting enough and loud enough to make it worth the money that you pay.
979;tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.
980;He's the perfect casting, creating a mix of shyness, naivet and brooding after his uncle is killed.
981;But what we did see was pretty good.
982;kirsten Dunst is a great Mary Jane.
983;It helps draw the male audience in, of course, that she's gorgeous in the role.
984;It was very appropriate to the character.
985;willem Dafoe was the perfect Green Goblin as well.
986;He handles the scenes where he's arguing with himself exceptionally well.
987;He fits the character in the comic to a T.
988;He simply steals the few scenes that he's in.
989;There's nothing really new here, but I was pleased to see how close they came to the actual comic plot.
990;They kept true to the spirit of the characters for the most part, with only minor changes.
991;still, this is a great movie to see if you're just in the mood for a popcorn flick.
992;It's exciting, has lots of eye candy and it will entertain you.
993;I was a big fan of the comics, and my wife has never read one before in her life.
994;That should be a good indication.
995;I really liked this movie.
996;Although I had never followed the comic book series I was still able to follow along with this movie.
997;The movie had a good plot and a good story line.
998;This is one of the best movie's i've seen thus far.
999;I've seen it 3 times and i love it even more.
1000;This movie stays true to the comics because you know that even the director is a fan himself.
1001;Even the cgi is great.
1002;There are moments that just take my breath away.
1003;Everything in the movie left me happy, though.
1004;Peter Parker had that charming attitude with him and those sarcastic, charming sort.
1005;life with these and other aspects of everything I remember from the animated series.
1006;I always loved the Spiderman cartoon series and the movie only improved upon what I expected to see when I watched the cartoon as a kid!
1007;I'm happy with the movie :.)
1008;Tobey McGuire is so sweet and cute and you just had to love him.
1009;This was a definite evil versus good movie and I found it quite entertaining.
1010;A must to watch and own.
1011;The effects on this movie is super!
1012;Doing superheroes on the movies can work, but it takes treading a fine line.
1013;But Spiderman surprised me how watchable it is.
1014;william Defoe is perfect as the Green Goblin, showing the caliber of the production.
1015;of course, but what a fun fantasy, action packed fantasy.
1016;Tobey Maguire brings the Spider Man character to life, he makes the character seem so real, and those Spider Man moves are so slick.
1017;He's having fun and you're having fun watching this.
1018;Even his nemesis, the Green Goblin has some incredible scenes (and cool dialogue).
1019;His transformation happening over night makes more sense than the comic.
1020;His learning curve on swinging from his webs were funny and more 'realistic'.
1021;The special effects and action scenes were awesome to say the least.
1022;Randy Savage as the wrestler was a humorous casting and a welcome interpretation.
1023;over all I liked the movie.
1024;it is a fine movie, but you'll find yourself longing for more
1025;This movie is really really good.
1026;It reminds me of why I loved comics as a kid.
1027;The script stays very close to the original Spider.
1028;Its cool to see Peter Parker stumble into his super powers and learn how to use them.
1029;I dont think Willem Dafoe has ever had a bad performance but he absolutely shines as the menacing Osborne / Goblin.
1030;Tobey Macguire is perfect as Peter Parker.
1031;The original comic portrayed Parker as a nerd who becomed this hero, and Tobey plays the part perfectly.
1032;She is the perfect girl next door.
1033;Very sweet and incredibly sexual at the same time.
1034;but in this movie it fits because Spider.
1035;This film was more than worth the ticket fee and is a sure.
1036;fire repeat of amazing proportions!!!
1037;The poses and battle moves spidey uses are right on, as well as his dialogue.
1038;I won't ruin it for people, but I tell you now the fight scenes and scenarios are [great].
1039;Firstly here is a super hero I can relate.
1040;This films works on several levels, but essentially its a love story.
1041;A love for a girl (Mary Parker), for his extended family, and for the people of New York.
1042;Great performances by Toby Maguire, and Kirsten Dunst, who show a great chemistry, I never tire of watching this.
1043;Chick flicks are well known for dealing with the internals of the characters, and if there's one thing that SPIDER.
1044;mAN excels at it's giving us a look at what's going on in the hearts of everyone in the film.
1045;i've never seen a superhero film where everyone is so human, so in that way, Raimi carries on the tradition of the original comic book series.
1046;time comic reader, I viewed this movie with some trepidation.
1047;as much confidence as I had in Raimi the director, I still had to recognize that this one was a Major Hollywood Blockbuster, with Major Hollywood Money and Major Hollywood Politics behind it.
1048;everyone in this film cares for someone, and everyone pays the price for doing so.
1049;The story ends on a maginficent note that is at once tragic and hopeful, and if there's ever a movie that had me ready for a sequel, this is it.
1050;With this film, he establishes himself as the foremost expert in the genre.
1051;An excursion to Columbia University science lab transforms the bespectacled Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) with miraculous vision, sculpted body after a genetically.
1052;enhanced F/X to capture panoramic swings in its most realistic and The Times Square action.
1053;sequence is one of the most dazzling in cinematic history.Yet the superhero adventure fails to surprise because of its conventional storyline of good.
1054;man spins a complex web of humanity and empathy for the characters .
1055;and Tobey Maguire as the lead is the emotional core who captivates with his vulnerability in handling his growth traumas, doubts and fears.
1056;interest Mary Jane, James Franco as his buddy and even his uncle Ben played by Cliff Robertson show surprising dimensions.
1057;And Sam Raimi displays the same sensitivity here with his eariler works like Darkman with his flawed avenger.
1058;He directs it with eye.
1059;popping visuals like Army of Darkness and the comic hero resonates in its true.
1060;man a nifty web .
1061;and Maguire has definitely triumphed the cynics with his soulful spin.
1062;this movie is really good and that doesn't change.
1063;i recommend this one to anyone who liked the movie when they saw it in theatres and I also recommend it to someone who hasn't seen it.you won't be dissapointed.
1064;Now I have multiple UV accounts that will be a pain to manage.
1065;man tops the chart as one of the best movies of 2002 so far.
1066;I loved this so much!
1067;It was awesome and very spectacular cinementogrphy.
1068;I'll say right up front that I enjoyed the movie for entertainments value.
1069;I enjoyed the action that Sam Raimi gave us, although I thought it was too fast.
1070;with a great sense of humor, confidence, and well.
1071;and as Spiderman, he's still a man in that suit.
1072;Beyond that, the movie was cool.
1073;Beyond that, not a bad adaptation.
1074;Tobey Maguire is outstanding as Peter Parker, the nerdy high school student who moonlights as Spider.
1075;I absolutely loved this movie.
1076;Willem Dafoe plays a terrific villan and is very eerie.
1077;I thought it was well written and acted.
1078;I highly recommend this movie to all ages.
1079;girl, Judge Dredd, Batman Forever, etc) I think it's the best movie to date.
1080;goers alike and it definitely deserved all of that and I would like to add my share of praise to Spider Man.
1081;This movie is unbelievably great.
1082;man with a passion, and also trying to win the love of Mary Jane Watson who is in love with Parker's best friend Harry Osborn, who is the son of company CEO, Norman Osborn.
1083;William Dafoe definitely shows the pure evil expressions yet the internal vulnerabilities of Norman Osborn.
1084;quite frankly, I love the choice of the actors who were selected to play the characters.
1085;Kristen Dunst filling in the role as Mary Jane Watson was absolutely unforgettable and showed the incredible beauty and the intelligence of Watson.
1086;Then there are some relatively overlooked but unforgettable characters like the high school ruffian bully Flash Thompson.
1087;I actually loved watching the fighting scene between Parker and Thompson and its hilarious outcome.
1088;I feel that this movie was the best comic book adaptation in many years, if not of all time and none of the characters were dumbed down to one.
1089;there are some interesting messages of how such great power and control also come with the need for great responsibility and it really is something to think about and I feel that those messages combined with fun action scenes in Spider Man make it a marvelous movie that is definitely miles above a lot of similar superhero movies or weak superhero movie additions that are sunk down by the MTV.
1090;oriented sequences, most notably Batman and Robin.
1091;Let's just make sure that Joel Schumacher stays far away from this franchise.
1092;While this movie might have some room for improvement, Spider Man is about as great as comic book movie filmmaking gets with its fun atmosphere and eye.
1093;popping action sequences and wonderful script and all of these things bring this movie to life.
1094;Despite all of the negative flaws of both of these two movies, they are both classics and make a great action movie combo!
1095;Both make great compliments, Spider.
1096;man having a fun and colorful mood yet dark atmosphere while X. men has a darker and much more dramatic atmosphere and these two are great movies to include side by side.
1097;This movie had great special effects, and the story was interesting.
1098;The characters are cast with great care and the main character, the web slinger (Tobey Maguire)does the part justice.
1099;This set is a must for all collectors and die hard Spider.
1100;I like this version of the Spiderman series the best.
1101;I've seen the latest movie, (The Amazing Spiderman), but I still like this one better.
1102;But it does so many important things right that it can be forgiven for its weaker points.
1103;Most importantly, it is a fun, kinetic movie that doesn't let up.
1104;the most successful element of Spider.
1105;Director Sam Raimi brings his manic visualization skills to the film, making Spidey's famous webswinging as exciting as they can be, without undue showing off.
1106;And the casting is simply brilliant.
1107;The best performance of his career so far.
1108;Kirsten Dunst was a terrific choice for Mary Jane .
1109;man is probably the sexiest moment in movies this year!
1110;the comedic elements are delightful
1111;man's name is a hoot, as are his interactions with Mary Jane and the Daily Bugle.
1112;The overall sense of fun is infectious, and the story moves along briskly enough that there are never any dull moments.
1113;a great movie for sheer entertainment.
1114;man ended all I could say to my brother who went and saw it with me was That was the best movie I have ever seen.
1115;The movie is truly amazing.
1116;All the actors were amazing.
1117;man and Kirsten Dunst was good as Mary.
1118;I also thought William Defoe was good as The Green Goblin.
1119;The movie stayed very true to the comics and everything!
1120;this movie is nonstop and keeps you wanting more.
1121;The movie is great and I think everyone should go and see it.
1122;I wish I could give it more than 5 stars it was that good.
1123;Though regarding this film, I found Tobey Maguire very likeable, very true to the original concept of Peter Parker, who was always a regular kid and never the typical, blue.
1124;So this is a funny, funny movie, best suited to laughing at it in the back row.
1125;I also like the nod to the comic books in the supplemental materials.
1126;You do feel for the characters well enough, though.
1127;It wasn't great, or very good, just good.
1128;I hope to see it vastly improved upon for the sequel.
1129;I really liked this movies but I don't see it as a real hitIt isn't like star wars or something, but when you go home you are satisfied that you've seen itThis movie is just like the comicsIt's funny and technically there's nothin' wrong with itBelieve me this movie has great actors (not too famous yet) and a great director
1130;Is this a screwup and will the studio make it right???
1131;A trusted friend had recommended this movie with two reservations1.
1132;my god, they were fantastic.
1133;i'm surprised Hollywood didn't cast a Backstreet Boy!
1134;McGuire was believable before and after his transformation.
1135;He chewed up the scenary and spewed out a believable character.
1136;this is a movie for the whole family!!!
1137;But my favorite hero of all is SPIDER.
1138;mAN and I haven't even seen the movie yet, just some cartoons!
1139;Spiderman and Spiderman 2 are two fast action movies which hinge on the implausible.
1140;Realizing that we can look at the movies with a great suspension of belief.
1141;It is one of the greatest film kisses in the history of film.
1142;But, this is a very good film and worth your time to watch.
1143;Sit back and open up your soda, put the bowl of popcorn on the table and get comfortable.
1144;You're in for a real good time with your feet up on the coffee table.
1145;review:One of the best comic book hero movies to come out, melding comic book.
1146;fantasy into drama through script writing and impressive special effects.
1147;audience:Great movie for comic hero buffs, adventure movie watchers, and not.
1148;The story balances drama and humor delivering an emotional roller coaster.
1149;Rememberences of going to the corner store picking up copies of The Amazing Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk, X. men, any of the Draculas I could find
1150;The goblin mask represents an archetype of villainy, and in this Satanist's opinion, is well.
1151;which was quite a delightful surprise, really.
1152;there is a touching scene with Peter's uncle really tugs at the heart.
1153;both the promoter and the thief receive dark justice.
1154;overall, this film is definitely recommended for the Spiderman fan, who should not be disappointed
1155;arachnid's lore, this will prove to be a worthy introduction.
1156;man ranks up there with X. men, Blade 2, Batman,and Batman forever as one of the Greatest Comic Book Movies of all time.
1157;Maguire is perfectly cast as the legendary webslinger, and suprisingly, so is Kirsten Dunst as Mary.
1158;This is, in my mind, the single greatest Superhero movie ever made.
1159;packed, and yet it has a heart.
1160;The special effects are awesome eye.
1161;Tobey Maguire is a credible Peter Parker, and this movie is almost more about Peter Parker than it is Spiderman.
1162;kirsten Dunst is wonderful as the object of Parker's infatuation.
1163;She has an adorable girl.
1164;In short, this is precisely what the film needs as Dunst's character is the symbolic all.
1165;american sweetheart that so many of us guys fall in love with in high school .
1166;but are never able to actually date.
1167;willem Dafoe is, quite simply, the greatest Super.
1168;What's more, as is the case with Spiderman, the film does a remarkable job of humanizing his character as well.
1169;The soundtrack, courtesy of Danny Elfman, is outstanding.
1170;The direction is terrific, as is the acting.
1171;As an added bonus, the 2nd disc offers commentary and backdrop material of both the comic strip as well as the movie.
1172;Most significant is an interview with the creator of SPIDERMAN himself: Stan Lee.
1173;It was terrific to see that he had a big hand in the writing and production of SPIDERMAN.
1174;the symmetry and length of the film are right on the money.
1175;It had just the right mix of the stories of the Goblin and Spiderman, enough grand standoffs + some mini.
1176;The same holds true for movies.
1177;That is their prerogative, of course, but it also nullifies their tirades.
1178;I cannot give a greater compliment to a movie of the Superhero genre, for that is precisely what you should feel like after viewing a story such as this.
1179;Spider Man is creaky at times, but it is so much fun it's easy to forgive any flaws in it.
1180;It's got great characters, action, acting and heart, it's one of the best popcorn flicks you'll ever see.
1181;Tobey McGuire may not be the wisecracking Spidey we know from the comic books, but he is completely believable as the young teen with these strange new powers.
1182;Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Green Goblin even if the Goblin design could have been a little better.
1183;I also loved J. k. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst, Robertson and Harris are great as M. j. and Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
1184;When you think about the genius of how the first film was handled with Parker not giving much thought to the dangers of his new found gifts, it's a really good choice to not have over emphasized that point.
1185;I also love the ending of the film which I know also made all the ladies big fans of this film.
1186;Besides being an extremely fun film it is also a very important one because super hero films had not been taken very seriously until after this film made a ton of money.
1187;(which may have to await $K resolution monitors) but the picture and sound were very satisfying.
1188;Kudos to Sam Raimi and Co. for delivering on the promise of 18 years of copyright wars!!
1189;man is a full throttle, devoted and faithful adaptation of the greatest comic book hero ever.
1190;Tobey Maguire shines as Peter Parker/Spiderman, and Willem Dafoe lends a deft bit of psychosis and humanity to the role of the Green Goblin.
1191;And special nods to to Cliff Robertson as the emphatic and sympathetic Uncle Ben.
1192;In fact, this is hands down the best comic adaptation since the original Superman.
1193;This film gives me hope, because it effectively demonstrates that there are filmmakers out there who still can embody their characters with a sense of wonder and awe.
1194;That's the strength of this movie.
1195;It's good to have a hero to cheer for again!!!
1196;If it makes a lot of money, make it again.
1197;i hope the second one is a bit more believable in terms of his relationship with other people.
1198;The special effects were phenomenal.
1199;The story held my attention from beginning to end.
1200;It was really surprising how great a job they did on this film.
1201;There is great acting (Tobey Maguire as Parker and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin).
1202;There were also some really good cameos .
1203;Casting Tobey Maguire is the best thing about this movie
1204;Uncle Ben and Aunt May are also played by underwhelming actors.
1205;the special effects were also second rate, especially compared with for example Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.
1206;c'mon, in this day and age you could probably find better combat scenes in any 3rd rate B. movie with a fraction of this film's production budget!One nice thing about this movie is the political subtext: at the film's ending, we see Spidey swinging by an American flag atop a skyscraper while Maguire's voiceover recalls his Uncle's last lecture: With great power comes great responsibility.
1207;The actors were perfect for their roles and the action was great.
1208;It brings you into Peter Parker's world and allows you to discover with him, his new power.
1209;Probably the best in the trilogy, it introduces you to one of our favorite super heroes with great style.
1210;the special effects are absolutely superb, while sometimes they do over.
1211;I'm a moderate fan of Spider.
1212;man, owning two Playstation games, and soon this video, but if you're a fan of Stan Lee's excellent comic book, web.
1213;slinging super hero, you definitely should look into this.
1214;I personally believe that they followed the original story almost 100%, and give an excellent performance.
1215;exaggereated' graphics or special effects, this movie was an extremely cool beginning.
1216;Obviously, I enjoy the film.
1217;I'll leave reviews of that up to other people.
1218;The interviews with Stan Lee are wonderful.
1219;The interview with Stan's wife is equally delightful.
1220;We get to listen to The Man read a fantastic poem he wrote years ago, and we are treated to some home movies!
1221;Good things come to all that wait works like a charm here.
1222;But for once everybody did just about everything right, and the results are smashingly good.
1223;time to the responsibilities he has somewhat inherited.
1224;With few exceptions, the movie goes to great lengths to keep millions of fans happy.
1225;A bigger, more important difference is the fact that the movie Spiderman's body produces it's own webbing, while the book has him shooting web cartridges that he invented himself.
1226;casting is as perfect as can be.
1227;I had thought a younger Tom Cruise would be a great Peter Parker, but Toby Maguire now owns the role, showing the shyness and vulnerability of the character perfectly.
1228;The portrayals of J. Jonah Jameson, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, and Harry Osborne are also done well.
1229;moves takes the care to show something beyond just human gymnastics.
1230;the movie does have something for everyone, and I hope everyone sees it to insure a string of Spiderman movies.
1231;of course, there are also those millions of fans, some that have waited almost forty years for this to happen, to finally get their due.
1232;much to my delight, the movie is very faithful to the original comic, with only a few minor variations, none of which detracted from my enjoyment of the film.
1233;The music in the movie is very good, ESPECIALLY the opening music.
1234;And the PLOT, my goodness, I never thought a movie based off a comic book could have such a wonderful plot.
1235;This really is a family movie, a crowd pleaser, and the type of film that everyone should get something out of.
1236;The type of Blockbuster that the people involved actually cared about making, and it shows.
1237;The characters are so much fun, from the central trio of young adults.
1238;making, James Franco as his best friend, the troubled Harry Osbourne, and Kirsten Dunst, perfect as the warm and friendly but slightly inaccessible girl.
1239;to the great Willem Dafoe, hamming it up gorgeously as Harry's scientist father, a. k. a.
1240;One of the funniest scenes is when a wounded Spidey gets a pep talk from the responsible Goblin, who sits conspiratorily beside him and taps the woozy Spidey's head to get his attention.
1241;cheek, every frame is drenched in colour, and the whole film shows the signs of love that went into making it.
1242;True, not everything works, some of the big special.
1243;effects scenes look a bit too animated, but bring on the sequels anyway, this one was a lot of fun.
1244;I've waited for so long for a movie to made about spidey, and it was worth the wait.
1245;Great story, great action , and great special effects.
1246;I have to say this movie far passes x. men, which i thought was very good.
1247;My son begged and pleaded with me to take him to see it.
1248;I went in with reserved expectations and came out thoroughly entertained.
1249;Spiderman took you away from the realities of the real world for a couple of hours.
1250;Which is why I enjoyed it so much.
1251;This movie was completely entertaining.
1252;man comics, always anxiously awaiting each month to see what new catastrophe our webbed hero would have to face.
1253;strength, can jump great distances, and maybe best of all, he's got a spider.
1254;but when Peter's uncle is killed by a robber, he realizes that with great power comes great responsiblity.
1255;film miscasting since George Clooney as Batman.
1256;for all that's wrong with the portrayal of those major characters, the origin story is really rather well done.
1257;Truth be told, I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit until Parker suited up as Spider.
1258;Maybe the Goblin aspect of Osbourne's personality is power.
1259;(moderate spoiler in this sentence) The dichotomy of the hero and villain is fairly interesting and their final mano.
1260;Great acting, lovely script, and the director of photograpy deserves a noteable mention.
1261;man is the best movie I've seen in a long time.
1262;I think this movie had great action and had a little romance, which is good.
1263;I saw this in the theater and it was an awesome adaptation.
1264;Anyway, this film by Sam Rani is genius but does borrow a lot from the original James Cameron script, particularly the organic web shooters.
1265;Still he makes it his own with the way he takes the classic origin story and updates it!
1266;the extras also make this one a keeper!
1267;man, and what happens to his Uncle Ben.
1268;The rest is characters taking to each other, and making pleasantries.
1269;man is pretty much one of the best superhero films next to Batman.
1270;He is my favorite music composer.
1271;Sam Raimi did good direction for this film, and Tobey Maguire did good as Peter Parker/Spider.
1272;I will definitely be getting it the first day it comes out.
1273;well, then I guess we have found it.
1274;book hero to hit the screen, and in the 80s with the release of the Highly rated Batman film Directed by Tim Burton (See Batman Review)Stan Lee Quote: Me and Bob(Kane) often teased each other about who's comic.
1275;hero movie it's a story about two people in love too.
1276;Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie.
1277;The cinematography also had a warm, upbeat feeling to it.
1278;It was one of the main reasons the movie kept my eyes glued to the screen.
1279;From Tobey Maguire's clumsy but lovable Peter Parker to Kirstin Dunst's beautiful Mary Jane Watson to Willem Dafoe's deliciously evil Green Goblin, the actors most definitely made the movie.
1280;The producers certainly picked the right people to handle the characters.
1281;This movie portrays the great works of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who made Spider.
1282;popular comic book while making Marvel Comics famous.
1283;a bite by a rare breed of spiders at the Columbia University science lab gives Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) great vision and a perfect body.
1284;tobey Maguire, with the emotional lead role overcomes the tragic death of his beloved Uncle Ben, growth trauma's, doubts, sorrows, and fear, to save lives and become the city icon.
1285;Kirsten Dunst fits the role nicely as Peter's love Mary Jane.
1286;Even characters with smaller parts like Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), and his friend Harry (James Franco) are amazing.
1287;screen version of the Marvel Comic's good.

1289;popping special effects, great sound and much more.
1290;man comic book fan this is a movie you have to see.
1291;Pure fantasy, of course, but what a fun story.
1292;Pure good vs. pure evil, and throw in a little romance.
1293;Lots of fun for everyone.
1294;Great effects without being a cartoon.
1295;AND I'm sure most of them loved itI personally thought this movie was excellent and it was like watching the comic book come to life.
1296;Yes, Batman had some great sets, but I don't remember any of the comic book looking anything like that at all.
1297;This movie not only stayed true to the comic book (I'd say about 90%), it had spectacular web.
1298;Tobey Maguire was a great pick for Spider.
1299;anybody that was a fan of the comic book will love this movie, in my opinion.
1300;I liked this better than the X. men, even.
1301;graphically, more pleasing and like I said, it was like seeing your favorite comic book come to life.
1302;The filmmakers must have become pretty good at wrangling this dynamic.
1303;should appeal both to Spidey fans and serious film folk alike.
1304;disc set is packed with extras that are well.
1305;organized and, for the most part, worth the effort to wade through.
1306;the movie looks fine, especially considering all the disc space devoted to extras.
1307;Images range from OK (the Parker household set) to spectacular (the shining scenes over Gotham).
1308;The amazing look of the trailers collection hints at the potential for a reference.
1309;The fun takes a while to get started, but the soundstage soon enough does a home invasion on the viewing room.
1310;Rear effects consistently keep listeners on edge, delivering a few solid jolts (the Green Goblin's flashback, for instance).
1311;director Sam Raimi and co. producer Grant Curtis provide entertaining commentary, their talk paired with a separate session by producer Laura Ziskin and star Kirsten Dunst.
1312;He spends a lot of time crediting co. workers like the second unit directors, giving the scope of just how intensely collaborative modern action films are.
1313;the film has two huge effects scenes .
1314;when Sam Raimi was interviewed about this film he kept saying how much he loved the characters and how he was going to stay true to the spirit of the comic.
1315;Not one of the major changes from comic to film was necessary, but were all done in the interests of having a modern approach and making it more believable.
1316;Very little in a superhero comic could be considered believable, but we wanted to see the Spiderman we all knew brought to the big screen anyway.
1317;But in the film he is just one of many students on a class field trip.
1318;there is an interesting duality about Peter Parker.
1319;It made him both a good student and a superhero.
1320;His love of science defines him and hampers him at the same time.
1321;It is his life, and his knowledge of it saved him many times where his powers alone couldn't have.
1322;Without that science background you diminish the character of Peter Parker and it certainly shows in this film.
1323;Is it believable that some children can play a musical instrument before they can read or write?
1324;Some people are just born gifted, and in the case of Peter Parker his gift is science.
1325;Dafoe was perfect for the Goblin and all of the cast nailed the dominant personality traits of their characters as they are portrayed in the comic.
1326;It was great to see all the little kids walk out of the theatre pretending to shoot webs.
1327;They hit that one perfect also.
1328;Spiderman is young, hip and hopeful, not dark and brooding.
1329;mAN was the the #1 film of 2002
1330;the film's good points though are Tobey Maguire's solid potrayal of Peter Parker/Spider.
1331;man and Kirsten Dunst as the lovely MJ.
1332;It was fun, somewhat exciting, and the performances were grand.
1333;And also because I like Sam Raimi, the director, because he made a favorite movie of mine before.
1334;mAN, but Raimi did a good job at building a comic.
1335;It's not better then the more plausible X. mEN 2, but it was good enough for a viewing.
1336;Superhero films are always a best bet for the kids!
1337;I thought the computer graphics were very cool too!
1338;Well, my sense was more right than my hopes, but a lot of fun is kind of an understatement
1339;stuff for the rest of my life.
1340;Therefore when time came for Spidey the movie, my ancient knowledge sparked to life, at least for a while, and for just a couple of hours I was all back to my 11.
1341;My favorite director, Sam Raimi isn't, but I have faith in the man and I trust him to make a fun flick.
1342;His directing is wild and crazy, unstoppable but therefore also guaranteed to float out of the frames.
1343;If you've seen DARKMAN (1990) or ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993) you'll see that SPIDER.
1344;cameo, Raimi holds up his traditions.
1345;They are no real favs of mine, but it's a good combination: all three of them are just about as OK actors.
1346;Dafoe did his thing, Dunst was cute (as always), I think Maguire stood out making Peter Parker a truly sympathetic character.
1347;True, the digital effects are slick and perfect for the entertainment.
1348;When Spidey swings around Manhattan, I can't do nothing else but kick off my shoes (I literary did this) and lean back and just enjoy the ride.
1349;'Cause that is what you gotta do in a movie like this.
1350;Then you'll have a lot of fun.
1351;My rating is really a 7 out of 10, a bit of a challanger to BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and proving that BATMAN (1989) still is the best.
1352;Hopefully we'll see more of this in the sequels.
1353;Sam Raimi does a great job directing this, great camera shots.
1354;Willem Dafoe does a great job portraying the green goblin and norman osborn.
1355;man in the beginning, but he got better as the movie progressed.
1356;It is not the best movie, but it should make comic book fans jump for joy.
1357;man is the kind of movie that I can watch again and again that has never aged.
1358;It has only been a few years since it came out in theaters, but it is still as fun and spectacular as it was when I first watched it way back then.
1359;I have been a Spidey fan since the 80s, so he has always been a hero of mine, you can imagine the thrill I had when I finally got to see him on the big screen.
1360;Sam Raimi did an excellent job on this movie and it shows from beginning to end.
1361;tobey McGuire is definitely the perfect choice to play Peter Parker/Spider.
1362;He definitely brings the nerdiness out of Peter, but also brings the strength and courage of Spider.
1363;You feel for the guy when a certain family member dies, and you cheer when he finally gets his revenge on those who hurt him and his family.
1364;He is an incredible actor and is always fun to see on screen.
1365;From his change in voice to his facial expressions when he is the Goblin, no wonder he has been kept for the sequels, he is just someone fun to watch.
1366;The story and script is both compelling and fun and the special effects are amazing.
1367;This movie is awesome and it is something that you just have to see to believe.
1368;There are a lot of reviews here that speak about how the movie stayed faithful to the comic book.
1369;this is in no way a faithful comic book adaptation.
1370;but I have to say that SPIDERMAN is easily the best movie of its kind that I have ever seen, a movie that packs a tremendous whallop in terms of being just flat.
1371;The cast is solid
1372;one of the last to emerge from the golden age of comic books and still one of the most popular.
1373;but when he is bitten by a radioactive (in this case a genetically mutated) spider, he develops amazing powers.
1374;i would have never imagined Tobey Maguire in the role of Spiderman, but he brings the right blend of uncertainty and joy in his newly discovered powers to the role, and as a result is a superhero character that is a lot more believable than most other big screen efforts.
1375;Willen Dafoe, who has made a career of playing unexpected characters, is also perfectly cast as The Green Goblin, and the supporting cast.
1376;The film moves at a good pace, alternately witty and actionpacked, touching and sharp.
1377;And although the special effects are a bit dimmed by the translation to the small screen (I always find that CGI works better on the big screen), it is still fascinating stuff to watch.
1378;But that aside, SPIDERMAN is just a tremendous amount of fun to watch from start to finish, and if you can enter into that spirit of fun you'll enjoy every minute of it.
1379;Sam Raimi has made a subtly acted mainstream movie with 'The Gift', but unwisely returns to the style of 'Darkman' for this belated comic book adaption, presumably because he felt it worked a treat the first time.
1380;Parker ultimately managed to juggle a private life with heroism in the strip, thus making his vow of celebacy in the feature perplexing to the viewer.
1381;The original's charm and intrigue came from it's campus setting and if not for 'Buffy', which covers similar ground, it might have worked better as a series.
1382;Certainly, the first two 'Superman' films handled this sort of material with more wit and aplomb.
1383;I felt short changed, as I always do when confronted with this restricted aspect.
1384;When I was a little kid and learning to read (mid 40s) I just loved the funnies.
1385;I loved super heroes and super bad guys.
1386;Amazingly, a lot of these super heroes have stayed with us and now are on radio, television and in the movies.
1387;In any case, the movie got off to an appealing start and about the first third was an enjoyable, if not somewhat touching, story.

1389;boy gets bitten by a spider and begins to take on some remarkable changes.
1390;And do it in rapid sequential order.

1392;I want to remain in awe at the marvelous technology, both in this movie and other movies like it.
1393;ness) churned out a wonderful blend of special effects, character building, and story.
1394;The begining reminds me too much of Dawdson's Creek and Peter's Aunt and Uncle while very well acted were just too Ma and Pa Kettel.
1395;Great action sceans and there is lots of promise for a sequal.
1396;This is one heck of a good movie.
1397;He is a borderline genius who can't handle a simple conversation with the girl next door who he has loved for years, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).
1398;He works on the school paper, has coke.
1399;One day when the school is touring a science lab they go through an exhibit where scientists are trying to genetically mutate spiders combine all the individual powerful attributes of spiders into one super.
1400;Parker finds it as it bites him on the hand.
1401;When he returns to his Aunt and Uncle's house that night he passes out and has strange dreams involving the spider.
1402;Suddenly he learns to his horror that, With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.
1403;Parker uses a newly designed costume as well as increased skill with his powers to help the citizens of New York.
1404;He is rich, a brilliant inventor, and after ingesting a super.
1405;soldier type formula, quite insane.
1406;sam Raimi directs this with much of the style that he has done similar features previously with the Evil Dead series.
1407;This has many dark tones but is also infused with the humor that helps move the story along.
1408;The special effects are worth every penny that has been paid.
1409;Sure he had done a wonderful job in The Cider.
1410;Well, I have to apologize to Mr. Maguire because he certainly did a wonderful job hear.
1411;He definitly was able to handle the dramatic moments and also carried more than a certain sly charm that allowed him to do the trade.
1412;mark quips that fans of Spider.
1413;He also has spent an incredible amount of time with the personal trainers and that showed.
1414;i approached this movie with a certain amount of trepidation and yet enthusiastically.
1415;Thankfully the writers and direction of the movie all worked exceptionally well.
1416;Well, they expect something worth their 9 or 10 bucks .
1417;spiderman delivers a whole lot of film and a whole lot of fun for the money (Okay .
1418;toby McGuire IS Peter Parker!
1419;Rami cast the part (in fact all the parts) perfectly.
1420;Willem DaFoe is excellent as the Green Goblin.
1421;That said, it's a movie based on a beloved comic and its lead character .
1422;and I think that the movie is just about the best comic to film rendition ever done.
1423;This was a great superhero movie.
1424;Peter Parker is kind of the dorky kid in class.
1425;He lives the life of being a superhero and protects the city from the green goblin.
1426;to quote my sisterIt has a cute love storie for girls and lots of action for the guys.
1427;Spiderman is probably one of the greatest movies I have seen in a long time.
1428;It is packed with action and has a great lesson.
1429;IT is probably not a movie to show to younger kids but is great for anyone ready to sit back relax and enjoy a great movie.
1430;This movie was one of the best ones I have ever seen in my entire life.
1431;He gets bitten by a spider and has the sensation of super powers.
1432;This is another movie that made my 3 year old granddaughter very happy.
1433;Thank you very much for it and the fast delivery.
1434;I love how they have the 2.
1435;man and the E! special.
1436;All around it is a good movie and good extras.
1437;Good movie Good movie, what more can I say, it was a good movie as I stated in the title.
1438;I'm a big fan of spider.
1439;man 2 was bigger and better than the first spiderman.
1440;A name in the minds of every American this week.
1441;In it's first weekend Spider.
1442;The Phantom Menace, which arrived at the total in 13 days.40 years ago two men began a comic book character that would become a legacy.
1443;man, while the more popular Stan Lee, who has a cameo appearance in the movie, wrote the comic book.
1444;man's alter ego, Peter Parker, is a character that people can relate to, which is what has made the comic book so popular.
1445;it is an amazing treat to see Tobey Maguire as Spider.
1446;The two super humans go face to face in a battle of wits and strengths, challenging each other's minds and morals.
1447;the special effects, supervised by John Dykstra who also supervised the special effects on the pioneer special FX movie, Star Wars, were seamless and out of this world.
1448;the character relationships in the movie were surprisingly straight forward with the comic book world that they came from.
1449;The action was top notch, Spider.
1450;office success films in only the first week, I feel confident that it will continue up the ranks to the top ten in not any longer than two months.
1451;I for one will be in line once again on opening day to see what will be.
1452;The production values are high and the effects tastefully, often brilliantly done.
1453;Goblin, Babe, Uncle, Aunt are all in character and well crafted.
1454;Entertaining, well paced, slick without being sappy.
1455;Seemed to be a hit with my entire extended family, ages 4 to 84.
1456;man is an awesome 2002 superhero film from Sony Pictures and Marvel Entertainment.
1457;man's case, the character is a teenager with enormous power and responsibility thrust on him.
1458;This rankles his actual son(and Peter's best friend) Harry, played by James Franco, but that's a story for two other movies to tell.
1459;as Mary Jane Watson, Kirsten Dunst is intriguing playing a goodhearted character with a hard home life.
1460;Ms. Dunst has obvious talent and a palpable chemistry with her two young male co. stars.
1461;man is one of the best comic book adaptations of the modern era.
1462;I've always liked this film, Tobey and the cast are greatin it and Danny Elfman's score is excellent as usual.
1463;ray has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.
1464;i recommend this great film.
1465;Can anybody tell me what this wonderful comic became?
1466;Whats up with the organic webs?!!!?!!!!
1467;Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie.
1468;Spiderman made me feel great about New York again, but once I let everything settle down, I saw the movie again.
1469;Yes, but don't worship like its the best thing in the whole entire world.
1470;This movie totally lived up to my expectations.
1471;I've always been a Batman and Superman fan, since I was a kid.
1472;This is probably one of the movies I've most looked forward to seeing, and it beat the hype.
1473;The actors are great, the story had me hooked with a great balance of humor and drama, and the special effects are just incredible.
1474;It really feels like the comic come to life.
1475;The webslinging, dialogue, and even the poses are spot.
1476;The ending leaves the film open for a sequel, which I'll be greatly looking forward to.
1477;I've rarely enjoyed a movie this much.
1478;Mad props to all those involved in making this movie, I hope they crash the box office.
1479;My son loves this movie.
1480;When I saw that it was Danny Elfman, I was surprised.
1481;Overall, the acting is great and the effects are okay (not near as good as the subsequent movies).
1482;This movie is a great adaption of the comics.
1483;Great story line, great chemistry with characters.
1484;funny, it's formulaic but who cares!
1485;And of course, the success of the first brings about 2 sequels to make to look forward to now.
1486;Just a wonderful movie that really the whole family will enjoy.
1487;Great timely shipping and great product.
1488;Fortunately, director Sam Raimi and his stellar cast create a superhero classic that will rank up there with the first 2 Christopher Reeve Superman films and the Tim Burton Batman flicks as the best of their genre.
1489;by now, most people are familiar with Spidey's story.
1490;A nerdy high school student, Peter Parker, gains amazing powers after being bitten by a genetically mutated spider during a field trip.
1491;The casting is solid and most of them find the emotional truth in this unusual story.
1492;Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker/Spider.
1493;man and he succeeds in getting us to empathize and root for him.
1494;Willem Dafoe is delightfully hammy as the menacing Green Goblin.
1495;Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris add a wonderful touch of class as Peter's guardians, Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
1496;at a brisk 2 hours, Raimi keeps the film going at a good clip and the action sequences are engrossing.
1497;He also has fun with his audiences.
1498;man, but the movie is so fun that you don't really care.
1499;mAN that rare thing indeed.
1500;a superhero film with heart.
1501;Peter Parker was such a nice boy with a very nice Aunt and Uncle.
1502;It was a storybook family picture, which was refreshing.
1503;The story was well written, the acting was top.
1504;slinging effects and fighting scenes were the best I've ever seen in a movie.
1505;the comic book that is!
1506;It is definately worth the money and you won't be disappointed.
1507;I loved this movie when it first came out i still love it today and yes i love it way more than spider.
1508;man 2 Tobey Maguire was the perfect Spider.
1509;kirsten Dunst was a Great Mary Jane.
1510;all in all this is one the best super.
1511;hero movies of all time and one of my favorite superhero flicks Great action,great music by Danny Elfmen.
1512;Recently, superhero films have been an extremely effective genre in Hollywood.
1513;If made correctly, these kind of movies offer plenty of action, thrills, and character, while also being impressively designed and using some of the best special effects teams around.
1514;Bryan Singer's X. mEN was the movie that introduced the superhero film to the 21st century.
1515;That bar has definitely been raised to new levels many times since then with films such as the spectacular THE DARK KNIGHT and, to a lesser extent, IRON MAN.
1516;spider that escaped from an exhibit.
1517;In the morning, he finds that he also has gained heightened strength, agility, can spin webs from his wrists, climb walls, and a certain spider.
1518;Mary Jane and Peter become much closer friends, despite the fact that she is now dating Harry.
1519;She also thinks she loves Spider.
1520;They finally square off in a fantastic showdown that is also one of the best scenes in the entire movie.
1521;He has a personal vendetta against Spider.
1522;Up next is the cinematography during the scenes of Spider.
1523;Instead of keeping the camera a reasonable distance from him so we can see how he uses his surroundings to display his amazing powers, the camera is tight on him, right over his shoulder most of the time.
1524;Strangely, the cinematography for the action scenes is quite good.
1525;It was a very effective technique that was used for all the swinging and fighting scenes in SPIDER.
1526;As a matter of fact, everything in #2 is improved over #1.
1527;The acting, action pieces, dialogue, and especially the villain.
1528;Nevertheless, everything in this film still comes together reasonably well, with only a few drawbacks.
1529;Audio commentary with director Sam Raimi and producer Grant Curtis, Kirsten Dunst and producer Laura Ziskin.
1530;Audio commentary with special effects designer John Dykstra and visual effects crew.
1531;mania: An E! Entertainment Special.
1532;While this movie isn't as good as its sequel, it still is awesome.
1533;The movie does a nice job of telling the stroy of Spiderman.
1534;the movie is so good because it introduces the nerdy and weak Peter Parker and it then shows his developpment into a superhero.
1535;The visuals are gorgeous and the fights are awesome.
1536;The acting is also great with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe perfect for their roles.
1537;Once more the myth is born again
1538;the film merits lays undeniable, on a very amusing parade of special effects here and there with a touch of suggested sex, when covered by a suspenseful action, his secret love is blockaded by four intruders in the middle of a rainy and lonely street.
1539;He possesses all the attributes for the character, an undeniable charisma.
1540;Dafoe is fabulous as the sinister villain.
1541;The creators took some liberties with the storyline so as to make it appeal to the masses.
1542;an entertaining movie with some great visuals, it nevertheless suffers in a few places from some absolutely AWFUL dialogue.
1543;worth the price, but get your wine ready.
1544;my favorite super hero is spiderman and i love tobey macguire.
1545;The special effects will blow your mind!
1546;man blends utterly thrilling action with some light comedy, drama, and even a bit of romance!
1547;I really enjoyed it a lot, and what made it even more amazing was having Kirsten Dunst play the role of Mary.
1548;jane, the object of Peter Parker's affection.
1549;A beautiful face, and excellent talent.
1550;Tobey Maguire is also a great young actor, full of spunk and after this movie, I'm sure he's going to be a breakthrough actor, totally mainstream.
1551;This is a great movie, take the family and some friends along and enjoy!
1552;Spiderman is one of our favorites.
1553;Not a huge fan of 2 but one and three are the best!
1554;Possibly the best Superhero movie since the first two Supermans.
1555;man has going for it, are actors really enjoying their parts, a great script that doesn't insult the original conception and also that doesn't isolate casual viewers who may not know anything about the web.
1556;slinger, and a top notch director, Sam Raimi.
1557;A movie about a Superhero with 'daylight scenes.
1558;Toby Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker and our hero.
1559;Great execution, great timing and great special effects make this something more that just another Batman or X. men, this is something special.
1560;This is the best comic book movie ever with great acting and a real story line, it's truly brilliant.
1561;I've been a comics fan for most of my life, so when I heard that there was going to be a Spider.
1562;man movie, I was happy.
1563;The bite gives Peter exceptional agility, stamina, and strength, as well as the unique ability to spin webs from his wrists.
1564;Living by Uncle Ben's motto, With great power comes great responsibility, Peter becomes Spider.
1565;the acting was solid on all counts.
1566;Maguire was good both as the nerdy Peter Parker and the wisecracking Spider.
1567;Kirsten Dunst, who plays love interest and high school student Mary Jane Watson, wasn't spectacular but had great chemistry with Maguire.
1568;top at times as Green Goblin, but there was one scene in particular involving a mirror that was maybe the finest scene in the movie.
1569;Good luck finding it, though.
1570;overall, director Sam Raimi has created a comic book movie that's not just for comics fans.
1571;man has it all, and special feautures that you'll actually watch.
1572;man fan, and this movie is well done.
1573;Brilliant casting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst makes a very appealing Mary Jane Watson.
1574;The special effects of the webs were excellent, light years ahead of the late '70's TV series.
1575;i enjoyed the Batman and X. men movies more, but this still was a very good movie.
1576;I liked seeing the sequence of Spidey in action, which made me think of the 1979 Superman movie.
1577;Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'.
1578;She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here.
1579;I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture.
1580;He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner.
1581;I HATE it when comic.
1582;book superhero movies feel the need to do this.
1583;It just makes so much more sense this way.
1584;There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan.
1585;enjoyd it very much,and hope he and mj continue their love affair.
1586;I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it.
1587;Not knowing anything about the background of the Spiderman legend, I felt that the movie was a good mix of both explaining how Peter Parker became Spiderman and a full.
1588;I'll always prefer movies based on acting (but that is just me
1589;And Clark Kent has a much better conscience.
1590;But all in all a pretty good movie.
1591;Nothing great here, so far.
1592;Well this film pleased us both and in my opinion has to be one of the best adaptation of a comic book hero to the big screen.
1593;th special effects were very good, the acting by Tobey and company also very good.
1594;What I enjoyed the most was the humor that the film had.
1595;One thing that Spiderman fans like about the hero is the humor.
1596;the film will appeal to die.
1597;Because it has a lot of action, I like to watch the movie.
1598;Me and my friends watch it at my house.
1599;My little brother loves to watch the movie spider man.
1600;slinger finally hit the big screen.
1601;The beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst also steps up for the film and she takes on the role of Mary Jane Watson.
1602;Director Sam Rami, a fan of the comics, keeps the story and details of Spidey's world as true as one can with today's technology.
1603;The once skinny photographer wakes up a morning after the incident, and soon realizes that he has developed more than just bigger muscles, and better vision.
1604;Parker comes to the conclusion that it is up to him and his alter.
1605;I watched with my young boys and most of the movie was appropriate.
1606;This movie is worth the money, Pre.
1607;This is a great entry to the Spiderman series.
1608;It has very memorable moments like when Spiderman killed the green goblin(his best friend harrys father.)
1609;If you like this go see the second one.
1610;Special effects aside (except that they could have done more with the Green Goblin's mask could have been better), the story is just fantastic.
1611;They stayed true to the real story of how Spider.
1612;This is the one that seemed to stick to the original story the most and it turned out to be the most successful movie EVER.
1613;Action, love, good story, feelings, heart, and soul.
1614;I liked it very much and viewed it before seeing #2would recommend it to Spider lovers.
1615;I really enjoyed this widescreen movie plus great entertainment of action.
1616;I has a few minor flaws but otherwise its really good.
1617;The movie has everything, comedy, action, drama, and a little bit of romance.
1618;I was so excited to see spiderman, i had heard all the hype, the previews looked mind blowing.
1619;man is definately the best.
1620;The acting, special effects, and plot line are all superb.
1621;Everytime I watch it (which is quite often), I still find myself in awe about the whole experience.
1622;Each one exemplified the parts brilliantly while not being overly done.
1623;Mr. Maguire perfectly captured the role of a high.
1624;And is an absolute delight to behold as he screams with glee at his new found abilities.
1625;man has such heart and soul that any person could see themselves in the shoes of Peter Parker.
1626;slinger can do?With the coming sequels on the way one can hope and expect that they will all live up to the original.
1627;man and His Amazing Friends (Fire Star and Ice Man) and I thought this was even better.
1628;Now, finally we get a live action motion picture of my favorite neighborhood do.
1629;hollywood reports that the idea has been bandied around for nearly 20 years and it is a good thing that we have waited.
1630;Like the continuing Star Wars saga, the things done in this thrill.
1631;Peter Parker is raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
1632;He is bitten by a genetically altered spider and given amazing powers.
1633;This is one of my favorite all.
1634;Tobey Maguire is brilliant as both Parker and Spider.
1635;The audience can feel the exuberance as Peter discovers and begins to experiment with his new power.
1636;Willem Dafoe is masterful as the Jekyll/Hyde.
1637;James Franco was also great as the outcast son who takes a back seat to Peter for the attention of his father.
1638;Sam Raimi's passion for the characters should be realized.
1639;The movie itself is a whole lot of fun and the tons of special features just make it better.
1640;One thing: as much as i love Tobey Maguire, it was kind of creepy watching his shirtless screen test.
1641;The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web.
1642;swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen.
1643;Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers.
1644;The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic.
1645;With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J. k. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic.
1646;I was a Batman fan but this film is visually and emotionally amazing.
1647;It is almost a real human story.
1648;He is the essential Spider.
1649;You see that he feels right at home as Spider.
1650;man and succeeds at making Peter Parker his own.
1651;What is arguably the greatest and most successful comic book films of all time, it is almost as if you are reading a comic book.
1652;willem Dafoe is simply astonishing as the Green Goblin.
1653;In the beginning, hes an ordinary billionaire, but after the accident, the transition he makes from businessman to raving psychotic is simply amazing.
1654;You can tell he studied his character because his diction and his facial expressions are amazing if not straight out of the comics.
1655;This young lady is going places and it shows.
1656;Dunsts performance is breathtaking as she blends together the right mix of class, savvy, and sex appeal to make Mary Jane one of the most memorable comic book heroines ever portrayed on film.
1657;all in all, a great film which should be looked at as one of the greatest of all time.
1658;It is literally a comic book page that has come to life.
1659;For the so called collectible items you receive it is way over priced.
1660;Third, you receive a 35mm cell.
1661;i have a cool movie and a nice box to keep some comic books in.
1662;man truly delivered all the action, excitement, and special effects that the hype promised.
1663;Maguire was a fantastic and surprisingly studly Spider.
1664;I am not even a fan of the comic book or the cartoon but thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
1665;The door is wide open for a sequel, but unlike Batman, I think this franchise has potential.
1666;It has cool fight scenes and a great story.
1667;One of the things superb comic books have, in general, is an adequate nemesis for the hero.
1668;It makes one's heroic deeds that much more.
1669;A very good video transfer with good sound, this film has a few minor plot points to quibble with and is satisfying overall.
1670;Excellent performance from Tobey Maguire demonstrating the dichotomy of his existence.
1671;It is a very good movie and if you like Spider Man and have not seen this yet.
1672;Oh yeah you remember that part of the movie when Peter Parker was looking at his muscles in the mirror, those were mine.
1673;but it's kool but anyway it was a very good movie
1674;sure, this is a souless movie blockbuster, but it grabs your attention.
1675;The actors all turn in suprisingly good performances, even a scence.
1676;I reccomend this movie to anyone in need of a two hour pleasure ride.
1677;Wow, two discs of extras.
1678;Ol spidey had action for the boys, and a love interest for the girls, without over doing either.
1679;The movie contributed for to out family, than I can contribute to it.
1680;please do a good job on the sequel!!
1681;The movie is great, minus showing how he created his final costume.
1682;Very laking of anything beyond the movie.
1683;This was one great movie.
1684;this movie is mostely about how spiderman got to be and is pretty close to the comic book story.
1685;parts of the movie is funny when spiderman goes up against a wrestler named Bonesaw.
1686;i also loved the cgi effects when he is flying thru the air and jumping from building to building.
1687;it will be a 2 disc set and I hope it will include the deleted scene of the world trade center.
1688;I was absolutely shocked at Ebert's review of this movie.
1689;How in the WORLD do you expect a movie about a teen with the abilities of a human spider to be realistic?!
1690;man fan since the third grade and I absolutely LOVED this movie.
1691;A person who knows the ins and outs of the comics and who is a huge fan would be the BEST critic.
1692;But this movie was spectacular.
1693;Tobey Maguire was the best choice imaginable for the hero.
1694;Spiderman, I think, was one of the best films of 2002.
1695;It had a good story, great acting, good special effects, and great action sequences.
1696;I really enjoyed this movie.
1697;I had a smile on my face all the way through it.
1698;It's big and it's fun.
1699;movie: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is hopelessy in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst).
1700;adventure movie everyone will love.
1701;A Pan and Scan version is also available.
1702;The image looks quite good, if not great.
1703;(4.5/5)Features: There is an HBO making of, the evoltion of Spiderman, TV Spots, trailers, music videos, and much more.
1704;A fun action film, Toby definitely captures the spirit of Peter Parker, growing and learning to deal with his powers while growing into a man.
1705;It's just a fun movie.
1706;Special effects were great, and some of the liscense they took was actually an improvement.
1707;Maguire played an good Parker, with that geeky kind of outlook on everything.
1708;For a first movie that has to introduce everything and everybody, they did a wonderful job (much better than I expected).
1709;if you are looking for a fun night with the family, or just want a good fun action flick, this is a definite good choice.
1710;I even got to see it on a plane ride back from France.
1711;Watching Spiderman swing around the city, while the plane is undergoing turbulance is a VERY interesting feeling.
1712;His senses heighten and his scrawny body is transformed into that of a professional athlete.
1713;the acting is excellent throughout the movie.
1714;MaGuire, Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane) give top notch performances.
1715;The special effects are stunning as well.
1716;Comic book enthusiasts as well as action movie fans will love this movie.
1717;got it on time, new in package.
1718;son loved it of course.
1719;man with a friend and let me tell you it was wonderful!!!
1720;The villain in this movie is also brilliantly played!
1721;Go see this film, you won't be dissappointed!!!
1722;The movie I could say was pretty good, the costumes were well done, the computer graphics were well played, Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were good as the leading parts.
1723;i enjoyed Spider Man, but I had to give it 3 stars because of the way it ended.
1724;So I thought it might be fun to see.
1725;Reviews on the movie were reasonably good, too.
1726;They were very imaginative and interesting and it increased my expectations for the movie.
1727;When I first heard of the massive amounts of cash that this movie was making I was delighted.
1728;In all truth, the villains are usually the most fun to watch.
1729;I never knew how much I liked this version until the new one came out.
1730;Toby Maguire plays Peter Parker well and the storyline is fun for people of all ages.
1731;I love a cheesy superhero action film and on top of it I can now watch it with my kids who love Spidey.
1732;Funny thing is I enjoyed this one when it first came out long before I became a mom so it definitely has more longevity than I thought it would.
1733;I waited for 3 hours before getting my ticket, but it was worth it.
1734;taking, the cast was the best, the showdown was excellent.
1735;But, this is the best movie I have ever seen.
1736;It is a must see to ever Marvel marveller and to newcomers as well.
1737;This was a very visually engossing film, and on the whole, enjoyable.
1738;don't get me wrong, the action and graphics were intense and thrilling but the story stank.
1739;It's rare to see a movie that is both entertaining and compelling.
1740;It's also rare to see a mass.
1741;The lead story, Peter Parker's coming of age, is surprising in its depth and sincerety.
1742;Equally so is how developed Mary Jane's character was, particularly in light of the fact that the majority of the film's running time is reserved for Spider Man and Green Goblin's origins.
1743;The film merits four stars because it has heart, a rare element in Hollywood films of any stripe, let alone the action blockbuster.
1744;Plus, this movie is really cool.
1745;I was extremely pleased with this movie.
1746;Family values, a love story, and lots of fun action.
1747;It was acceptable to me.
1748;i highly recommend this movie!
1749;This was a surprisingly good movie.
1750;And, to top it all off, I always thought Spider.
1751;It's a typical superhero storyline, but was directed brilliantly.
1752;Much of the time focuses on his transformation from normal to freak, which is very amusing and worth watching.
1753;turned movie made in recent years, this is the one to watch.
1754;man was and is the number one hero.
1755;Your imagination is what makes reading so special.
1756;slinger right out of your head and put them on the big screen.
1757;he put his great directing, with great actors to bring us a amazing movie on the best comic series ever.
1758;everyone go see it right away!
1759;Sam Raimi (Darkman, Army of Darkness) does a fantastic job of bringing Spiderman to life on the big screen.
1760;Raimi who is a big fan of Spiderman himself was perfect to direct this movie and I hope he directs each and every sequel because no one is better for the job.
1761;I was a big fan of the Cartoon show in the 90's and everything I loved about is here.
1762;It has everything, action, romance comedy and drama.
1763;It's the perfect date movie too I must add.
1764;The action scenes are incredible for one thing, the movement's quick and if you blink you might miss something but to me that's what made it fun.
1765;Tobey Maguire and Kirstin Dunst are just adorable together, they share a lot of cute and heart warming scenes.
1766;Tobey's perfect in this movie, enjoyed his performance so much that I wouldn't mind seeing him get an oscar nomination.
1767;He has so much to overcome in this movie and each and every feeling he shows.you believe.
1768;That's how good he is.
1769;william Dafoe is also very good as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin.
1770;Although he wears this Green Goblin costume and raises hell with glider inside he's still a decent man that has a love for his son who he has been too busy for a lot of the time.
1771;It puzzles me how Raimi manages to throw all these things together so nicely in just a 2 hour movie.
1772;What are you waiting for check out this movie, trust me it's probably the best comic book movie ever made yes even better than Superman and X. men.
1773;man was a great movie because of the story and the action.
1774;I also thought that the characters were handled very well(especially Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson) and that the movie stayed faithful to what made Spider.
1775;man great over the years.
1776;i definitely recommend this movie to everyone(even if you're not a comic book fan) .
1777;the acting other than wilem dafoe was excellent.
1778;because it is quite scary at points.
1779;I did recommended this movie to all my freinds.
1780;My boy loved it and wants to see it again,it is worth the second viewing of the SPIDERMAN movie.
1781;When I have #3 it will happen.
1782;it is a great piece of entertainment.
1783;ray and this newer version:.
1784;There is new cover art for the blu.
1785;Included is an Ultraviolet streaming copy of the film that works with various portable devices so that you can watch the film on.
1786;ray to capitalize on/promote The Amazing Spider.
1787;man film which arrives in theaters this summer.
1788;ray is give us some new material, whether it be an extended cut of the film or some new features.
1789;ray or did not own the previous version, then I highly recommend you pick this up.
1790;I predict that Spider man will be this summer's big hits!!!
1791;There is no aspect of this movie that jumps out and makes the viewer gasp: the acting is solid, but not Oscar worthy, the special effects are more than serviceable, but not breathtaking, and the plot is entertaining, but not particularly complex.
1792;man is a genuinely entertaining film that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls other comic book adaptations have encountered.
1793;While some have argued that Maguire's performance was somewhat leaden, I thought it was perfect within the context of the movie.
1794;On the flip side, Dunst absolutely sparkles in her role.
1795;top in the pouring rain, and she is an undeniably beautiful woman.
1796;The supporting cast is likewise solid, particularly William Dafoe in the role of the schizophrenic Green Goblin.
1797;He deftly succeeds in turning what could have been a very cookie cutter villain into a surprisingly empathetic character.
1798;the story itself is relatively straightforward, and will be familiar to anyone who has even a passing knowledge of the Spider.
1799;In particular, the early scenes, in which Peter is coming to grips with his newfound powers, contain just the right mix of humor and suspense.
1800;man accomplishes exactly what it set out to: entertain.
1801;It contains the perfect mixture of action, humor and romance, and combines very good performances from the cast with solid special effects.
1802;man is a very good send.
1803;up of a comic book hero.
1804;book's storyboard while watching the exciting action and stunts.
1805;green Goblin is worthy of an Oscar.
1806;A bit role played by by J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Daily Bugle Editor was particularly amazing.
1807;screen format made the action film very exciting on the home screen.
1808;Our entire family enjoyed this movie.
1809;Some of the characters, especially Spider Man's love interest and best friend, are a bit shallow .
1810;on a more positive note, I felt the reason for the characters transformation into Spiderman were quite interesting, the main character was enjoyable to watch as he grew with his new responsibilities.
1811;man is a hugely popular film franchise, and it's not without good reason.
1812;The first film is great with good acting, great special effects and music, and a great starting point for the story.
1813;There are a few particularly memorable scenes, the cage fight near the film's beginning being one of them.
1814;So overall I highly recommend Spider.
1815;When those opening titles with Danny Elfman's music started, I knew I was in for something special.
1816;tobey Maguire is outstanding at being the guy who can rarely catch a break, and perfectly embodies the 98 pound weakling becoming a changed man once he becomes a heroic figure.
1817;Kirsten Dunst is good and very easy on the eyes as Mary Jane even though the damsel in distress act gets very repetitive at times.
1818;I like how this movie accurately captures the estranged relationship between Norman and Harry much like in the early comics, and how Norman always seemed to favor Peter over Harry.
1819;the movie looks great and feels like the comic book in a lot of ways, especially since Sam Raimi was a huge fan of the character as a kid, and honors the comics from the 60's and early 70's very well.
1820;man in action along with Danny Elfman's great score which gives a great Spidey vibe.
1821;man 3, but Raimi did great with the first outing, and aced it with 2nd time around.
1822;Hopefully some people can watch this again and recognize what makes this a great film and maybe it can get the respect it deserves.
1823;when you compare this film to other films inspired by comicbooks such as the first batman film, x. men, and the first superman film, you will see that spider.
1824;He's an orphan, a put.
1825;His only friend is rich kid Harry Osborn (James Franco), and his meagre support structure includes his laid.
1826;Suddenly, Pete's got muscles and strange bodily emissions he has to keep hidden from his aunt and uncle.
1827;man, the beloved hero created way back in 1962 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.
1828;fortunately, Sam Raimi's version delivers the goods.
1829;It's an action adventure film with heart, and remains remarkably faithful to the spirit of those original Lee/Ditko comics
1830;handed gifts from the gods.
1831;What's really wonderful about it is that it spends so much time in its characters' heads, brings them to life not with shorthanded script cliches, but nuances and the smallest moments.
1832;Maguire manages to you hurt for the character in a subtle way not often seen in big.
1833;And Dunst's MJ manages to be both vulnerable and sexy, wholesome yet dangerous.
1834;it's in these very human, dramatic moments that it's easy to believe in these characters, but when the movie really needs to soar, when Peter Parker finds he's capable of amazing feats (wall.
1835;liners (something the comic Spidey does with aplomb, but rarely here).
1836;suitably sympathetic as he slides into insanity.
1837;It becomes more of a voice performance, but keeps the Goblin from really coming to life.
1838;what's left is a very good film, tons of fun, and arguably the best super.
1839;It's just that I enjoyed the Peter/Mary Jane/Harry scenes more than the Spidey scenes.
1840;There's a moment in the middle of the film where Spidey's rescued MJ and tells her she knows him.
1841;man in a bouyant tone, and for that moment, he's exactly right.
1842;I will give the movie its due insofar as that the special effects, cinematography, and sound score were enjoyable.
1843;The story line was designed to make people happy.
1844;man is a super hero that has been a part of my life for a very long time ever since I was old enough to understand the meaning of the words With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.
1845;man was unorthodox, mainly due to the character's status in the world as both Peter Parker and as Spider.
1846;Peter Parker is an outcast due to his vast intelligence, and eagerness for learning which, in effect ostracizes him from the rest of the human race.
1847;man such an appealing character for me to grow up watching, and believe you/me I have.
1848;I spent all my childhood watching reruns of the old 1960's cartoon, then it was the old 1980's cartoon, and finally the sublime 1990's animated series.
1849;sling into a new medium, preferably the cinema.
1850;Well finally my wish has been granted and it's beautiful!!!
1851;So when I heard about the changes in personnel I was seeing the ray of hope.
1852;at the time the news was announced I was just becoming a fan of his thanks to the beautiful Evil Dead Trilogy, and so I knew that Raimi was a director with a disciplined visual style, a knack for character depth, and an appealing sense of humor.
1853;man being great, the credit definitely goes to Raimi and Maguire.
1854;I knew Dafoe was perfect for the role after I saw him in Shadow of the Vampire, and obviously I wasn't disappointed.
1855;Probably for me his performance was at it's most effective in the scenes in his room.
1856;As for other obvious mentionables, there's Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben who show this beautiful commitment to their characters and you see their eagerness to ensure that Peter is raised right.
1857;Her performance succeeded in giving the character the depth and dimension that must be expected in the Spider.
1858;she looks bloody good as a red head.
1859;I could really care less about special effects and CGI as long as they're believable and it succeeds in getting the point across as to what's supposed to happen.
1860;Fortunately these effects combined with Sam Raimi's wonderful cinematic vision deliver a completely energetic cinematic rush that has truly never been seen before.
1861;He managed to tell Spider.
1862;man's legacy with that same humanity and flair that embodies the characters, though I won't say the script is flawless.
1863;So stop complaining you silly obsessives and enjoy it.
1864;so, in conclusion I will say that Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire have done for Spider.
1865;This is one of the best movies of its kind i've seen for a long time .
1866;You'll love it from start to finish .
1867;A new heros in town and i bet he'll be back again and again .
1868;As a teenager I can vividly remember many days spent at my friend's house, seeing a Spider.
1869;man invigorating, injecting an infusion of vitality into a comic book movie I haven't experienced since director Tim Burton's Batman in 1989.
1870;The first hour of the film entertained me more that the action packed second hour.
1871;We are treated to many humorous incidences when Peter Parker is discovering his new powers.
1872;At the screening I attended the theater erupted with laughter at them.
1873;man as he spun his webs and swung across the canyons of New York City.
1874;The final scene of the film illustrates my point.
1875;tobey Maguire proved to be a brilliant casting coup.
1876;He perfectly captured the quirky nerdiness of the teenage Peter Parker.
1877;Defoe's a fine actor and proves it once again here with his villainous turn.
1878;supporting characters, J. k. Simmons and James Franco gave phenomenal performances as J. j. Jameson and Harry Osbourne respectively.
1879;Franco's performance reflected the mild jealousy he had of Peter Parker because Parker gained his father's admiration.
1880;man ranks behind the first Superman film as the best comic book adaptation ever made.
1881;The thrilling actions sequences will quench the thirst of the summer moviegoer parched for excitement.
1882;I WANT them to utilize the technology in a fun and exiting way.
1883;well, you know what I mean.
1884;If we know they distort reality in the silly action sequences, we also now know that the story, characters, theme, plot, are all suspect.
1885;Her performance was excellent as well.
1886;In fact, everyone's performance was either good or perfect.
1887;Good see right away, you will not regret it.
1888;Now there's a channel with angst to spare.
1889;I mean come on,I thought I was watching a video game.
1890;clearly they put all their energy into the far superior LOTR.
1891;A Brilliant, unique and entertaining flick that dazzles the audiences with it's realistic special effects, great acting, terrific action and great script that makes this movie one of 2002's best movies.
1892;also recommended: The Crow, X. men, Batman, Superman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Harry Potter, The Matrix, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.
1893;fi modern Classics, wonderful F/X, sound and photo, very entertaining movie,great actors
1894;It is full of action and suspense and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie.
1895;the action in this movie is what makes it so great.
1896;a full five out of five review.
1897;I own this movie and I'm glad I bought it.
1898;This movie is just that, pure fun.
1899;The acting and script are on par with the comic book, and that means that it's moderately lame.
1900;Thus movie's pure fun and you'll want to see it over and over as much as you can, which is exactly what those people with the product placements want.
1901;Where's the good action scenes?
1902;I walked into this movie opening night with high hopes of a kick ass superhero film full of action and good acting (based on what I saw in the previews).
1903;Well, beats taking the subway, haha.
1904;now the movie did have some good action scsnes and a few good parts.
1905;Willem Dafoe did a great job as the green goblin.
1906;notch, action packed, dramatic superhero movie, Spider.
1907;Watch Batman, Blade, The Hulk, or even X. men.
1908;mAN and thought, man is this movie going to kick.
1909;Atleast X. mEN's story was clever, and even had roots in history .
1910;The movie also felt way to surreal.
1911;Overall, it's a very solid superhero movie with very good special effects by way of CGI.
1912;Spiderman's costume is cool looking.
1913;The musical score is pretty good.
1914;Overall this movie, in my opinion, ranks among the elite superhero movies ever made.
1915;overall, I recommend this movie if you want to be visually entertained while watching a good superhero movie.
1916;Time for the hero to be able to realize what he can do with his powers and maybe about a half and hour to 45 minutes into the movie he becomes the real Spider.
1917;the movie starts of with Peter Parker, a senior in highschool who has been pretty much the classic movie nerd at the beginning.
1918;He has been in love with the girl that lives next door to him, Mary Jane.
1919;The next morning Peter wakes up and goes through the day learning that he has incredible strength, agility, keen spider scenses, the ability to shoot webs, and the ability to climb walls.
1920;He tests it on himself and eventullay leads himself to complete insanity.
1921;This was truly a great and fun movie and I reccomend it to anyone who is looking for an action packed classic superhero story.
1922;This is by far the best comic book made movie since the first Batman.
1923;This movie is a great blend of action, drama, and comedy that is suitable for all ages.
1924;If you were a fan of Batman, X. men, or Superman, then Spiderman is sure to please.
1925;man was a perfectly spun movie.
1926;I never thought I would like a movie that came from a comic, but wow, was I surprised!
1927;From start to finish, it was perfect.
1928;This movie had all the good stuff.
1929;love, wisdom, responsibility, revenge, and awesome action scenes.
1930;There is so much more to it!
1931;Anyone that likes action movies should go see it!
1932;I so have to give this movie 5 stars.
1933;man is a perfectly spun movie, for anyone to enjoy.
1934;The film does justice to Marvel's Spiderman comic books and it's fun to watch even if you've never read a comic book.
1935;A live action Spiderman movie project was passed around from studio to studio.
1936;packed with patriotism and flag.
1937;He has to be mild.
1938;Kirsten Dunst is quite good as Mary Jane.
1939;The upside down kissing scene is a classic.
1940;James Franco is quite good as Peter's friend, Harry Osborne.
1941;Danny Elfman's Spiderman music score is good.
1942;john Dykstra(Star Wars, Batman Forever) crafted the visual effects for Spiderman(2002).
1943;Spiderman was one of the best movies of 2002.
1944;man I think along with Part 2 is the Best, they are tied.
1945;But it was Fun To watch on The Big Screen and now fun to own and watch in the living room for any SpiderMan Fan.
1946;There is nothing bad I can think of to say about this film.
1947;It was well writen and acted out.
1948;It's the kind of movie you can take your family, a date or see by yourself and still injoy it.
1949;, but he does a great job in this flick.
1950;William Dafoe is the perfect enemy for spiderman, and Kirsten Dunst does a great job of being the flighty romantic lead woman.
1951;All in all, they did justice to the Spiderman legend and this was a great work.
1952;The special effects displayed in this movie were dazzling and the Computer Generated Images were cutting edge.
1953;action Spiderman quiet entertaining and full of amazing (some) special effects and great acting.
1954;spider, and his body changes to the likes of a spider.
1955;in the positive way .
1956;of his new found skills, and begins to solve crime for the city.
1957;But the premise does work here, and keeps you entertained.
1958;Innocent, appealing, and a knack for small humor makes him a perfect lead.
1959;Kirsten Dunst is our female lead, and she .
1960;And her smile lights up any day.
1961;Defoe handled this part fairly well and made it believable.
1962;I found it more interesting when Peter was fighting off criminals.
1963;The rest of the supporting cast were great.
1964;The scenery is great, and gave the movie a real comic book feel to it.
1965;It's high gross rankings are certainly well deserved.
1966;I have to constantly remind them that this is a movie based on a comic book.
1967;Kids are not smooth, and I found the naive behaviour authentic and realistic.
1968;Oh yeah, the effects are sweet.
1969;An avid fan of Spider.
1970;man for the past two decades, I had considerable expectations going into this movie.
1971;The good news is that Spider.
1972;As a result, Parker finds himself mutating into a spider.
1973;Now the hopeless geek that nobody respected suddenly finds incredible powers at his command.
1974;This part of the film is done particularly well.
1975;As the truism goes, power corrupts.
1976;In order to impress his childhood sweatheart he decides he needs a car.
1977;The best way to obtain one?
1978;Inevitably personal tragedy teaches Parker that with great power comes great responsibility and he decides to use his powers to help the innocent people of New York City.
1979;This is kept perfectly in line with the comic and won't disappoint any true believers out there.
1980;Maguire is the perfect Parker conveying both emotional frailty and boyish charm.
1981;Supported by a fine cast of costars you can't help but enjoy Spider.
1982;Spidey might not have any new ideas to spin, but his web is in the right place.
1983;Peter Parker is an unassuming student who is smart, shy, and loves the girl next door (Mary Jane).
1984;But a trip to Columbia University's science department changes his life.
1985;At first he wants to use his new abilities to make money so he can impress Mary Jane.
1986;the movie does a nice job of setting the stage of the series while still brining in a super.
1987;casting was well done for most of the cast.
1988;Dunst manages to give some excellent Mary Jane smirks, the Osbornes actually look like they could be father and son and J. Jonah Jameson looks like he stepped right off the comic page.
1989;man succeeded in rescuing her).
1990;this is a fun film and if you can get past the fact that it is not the comic book you should enjoy it.
1991;I also loved the fascinating battle between good and evil, and the struggle within the characters between their human and superhero personas.
1992;I realize it was a lead.
1993;in to a sequel, but really, something more has to go on there.
1994;but the movie was good.
1995;cool set and nice to have dont really have much else to say but you know you should really pick it up
1996;Bottom Line: Nobody has pulled off a comic strip movie that followed the story line as closely, and captured the characters like Spiderman.
1997;The special effects were great and the story powerful, but the story did not hang together well.
1998;One geeky guy with a love interest to another girl, gets superpower.
1999;man is suppose to be the best superhero movie of the past 20 years.
2000;Spiderman/Peter Parker is suppose to be smart, funny, sensitive and caring.
2001;I loved every second of this.
2002;Your children will love it, even if they are grown and they have your grandchildren.
2003;This film is a wonderful start to what could easily be a ten year series of films, if done right.
2004;And always, the presence of Aunt May looms large.
2005;Spidey's greatest feats were always in protection of Aunt May.
2006;It will always get you a pounding from a super powered kid in a spider costume.
2007;Spiderman it's the best comic book.
2008;Surely, there's someone better than that for the role!
2009;tobey Maquire plays Peter Parker in an endearing way that portrays both the human and the superhuman side of our friendly neighborhood Spiderman.
2010;if you're looking for a little light entertainment, and want a fun, entertaining movie that's head and shoulders above most others released this past year, give Spiderman a try.
2011;spiderman easily qualifies as one of my favorite movies of the past couple of years.
2012;After almost a decade of legal battles, Sony Pictures was finally able to move into production the comic book adaptation of Marvel's popular hero Spiderman.
2013;With the success of X. men and then Spiderman we had entered a new era in movie history, a time in which comic books could be adapted to film and treated with realism and respect.
2014;Spiderman as both comic and non.
2015;comic book fans know, is the story of mild.
2016;Peter discovers his newfound abilities and embraces them, he sees them as a means to which he can win the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and also improve his lot in life.
2017;This action causes Peter to learn his most valuable lesson, With great power comes great responsibility, and also leads to Peter becoming the web.
2018;Needless to say Sony Pictures' Spiderman passed the test with great ease, giving audiences a thrill.
2019;With an impressive story, superb directing, incredible casting (Tobey Maguire's awesome performance of the dual roles of Peter Parker/Spiderman, being the biggest surprise), and a great soundtrack, Spiderman was an incredible comic book adaptation and heroic origin tale, that did what all movies (comic book and otherwise) should do, that is, leave the audience craving more.
2020;I guarantee that you will enjoy Spiderman over and over again.
2021;This is a great movie so is the second one.
2022;Spiderman is a great movie and it is not better than the second one it is tied with the second one.
2023;I was on the edge of my seat a very exciting movie.
2024;And Kirstin Dunst is hot.
2025;When I first saw it, I liked it, but after I thought about it, this movie wasn't as good as people made it out to be.
2026;man 2, but I hope that it delivers more than this one did.
2027;I've never liked superhero movies.
2028;It is an incredibly romantic, moving film.
2029;the guys behind these two movies know how to structure a story that delivers a powerful emotional payoff.
2030;Along the way they take you into a fascinating exploration of issues that will interest any person who aspires to.
2031;The director, Sam Raimi, has got you in the palm of his hand.
2032;And also in Spidey 1 when Uncle Ben tells Peter he understands what he's going thru.
2033;well, if you haven't seen it I won't spoil it but it's very funny and moving at the same time.
2034;okay, one more final thing: the values throughout this film are exquisite.
2035;sappy movies with a huge, romantic heart.
2036;All in all, I unreservedly recommend these movies for all those who like big.
2037;hearted movies that make you feel very, very good and stimulate you to think and wonder along the way.
2038;This was a good perchase for my husband.
2039;It is easily the best spiderman movie of the trilogy.
2040;A relatively unknown actor does a great job playing Spider Man.
2041;It'll make you want to watch the other 2.
2042;man comics, so I went into this film with cautious optimism.
2043;This was an excellent adaptation of the comics!
2044;In fact, I'd say this is one of the best comic movies ever made.
2045;I personally feel it's in the class of the first Superman and Batman movies.
2046;I loved the X. men movie, but I think Spider.
2047;I'm so happy they got it right.
2048;They got the perfect mixture of romance, action, humor, and drama in the film.
2049;It's a rare thing to see it all come together so well, but they pulled it off.
2050;You feel like you're a friend of Peter Parker's and you're following him on this incredible journey.
2051;i had several favorite scenes.
2052;As he discovered his power to stick to things and shoot webs, it's really hilarious.
2053;His confrontation with Flash is fun and cool.
2054;There's nothing better than seeing the geek triumph.
2055;It was a good move to change it from the comic and it not only added some funny moments, but it made Spider.
2056;If you've read the comics, you know what an emotional moment this is.
2057;It's even more powerful and exciting on the big screen.
2058;When this happens, Peter has yet to perfect his powers.
2059;It's one of the best action scenes ever in a comic movie.
2060;By the time it's over, you really understand his motivations for becoming a superhero.
2061;It's his first real fight for simple survival, and it really feels like it.
2062;And the ending is faithful to the comics, too.
2063;For every action scene, there are two scenes of simple conversation between characters.
2064;Sam Raimi goes to great pains to make you care for ALL of the characters before he gets into the action.
2065;You understand the tension and love between Harry and his father Norman.
2066;So when these extraordinary events start taking place, you have an emotional attachment to the characters.
2067;tobey Maguire is a great Peter Parker.
2068;He's shy and geeky in school, yet smart.
2069;mouthed and confident as Spider.
2070;Kirsten Dunst is great as the girl next door.
2071;Dunst makes it easy to see why she'd start feeling attracted to Peter.
2072;Willem Dafoe was a perfect Green Goblin.
2073;Then again, he's always been good at playing psychos.
2074;Dafoe is successful at making the Green Goblin both evil and sympathetic at the same time.
2075;He also dances along the line of being over.
2076;top without ever quite going over it like a lot of the Batman villains did.
2077;Finally, J. k. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is absolutely hilarious.
2078;He's actually the one that goes over.
2079;man is a wonderful moviegoing experience for people who love the comic and those who have no idea what Excelsior!
2080;Batman had a great one.
2081;Superman had a fantastic one.
2082;I hate saying this in light of the fact that I generally love Elfman's work.
2083;I thought the effects worked best when the camera was either sitting still or moving slowly.
2084;The rest of the time the camera was moving, twisting, and turning so wildly that it was hard to figure out what was happening.
2085;If it's between decent effects or a great story, I'd take the great story.
2086;But it would be nice to have both.
2087;competent with his powers to being a full.
2088;The only thing that bridges the two is a montage of scenes where New Yorkers talk about Spidey's exploits and we see flashes of him in action.
2089;It's fun, but it felt like something was missing.
2090;This is a wonderful movie that is true to its comic book.
2091;Tobey Maguire did a wonderful job as the one, the only, Spider.
2092;This is a movie that can hit close to home at some parts.
2093;The special effects were wonderful!
2094;I recommend this movie, although the plot isn't as profound or have as many hidden meanings as other movies, it's still a great find.
2095;The action was cool, the acting was good, Tobey Maguire IS Spiderman, what more could you ask for?
2096;It has a great soundtrack also.
2097;I was surprised that Toby Maguire did a great job as the young superhero.
2098;Dafoe's sinister green goblin was exquisite as well.
2099;Some of the best scenes are Spider.
2100;It is an excellent choice to watch though and surprisingly fun.
2101;The special effects were cool, and it was well directed.
2102;The acting was pretty good, and they didn't kill the plot from the comic books.
2103;The super spider's powers are transferred into Peter Parker.
2104;Bit by bit he descovers his powers, climbing on walls, jumping really far, extra strong, shooting webs, and sensing danger.
2105;meanwhile, Norman Osborn, a scientist takes a human body enhancer that is suposed to increase strength by 800%.
2106;So he steals a high tech glider and creates a costume and becomes the Green Goblin.
2107;man and the Green Goblin have a show down, which is pretty cool.
2108;so all in all, it is a pretty cool action movie, with cool special effects, and they didn't ruin this movie, like they did with Daredevil, which was really stupid.
2109;So as comic book movies go, this is at the top with X. men.
2110;I am a huge fan of Spiderman and this movie did not let me down!
2111;In fact I love it!
2112;The cast was great and the action was perfect!
2113;I especially like Tobey's screen test footage in the special features and the comic book art gallery!
2114;You must hand it to Raimi for not only successfully translating this larger than life legend to the silver screen, but also toppling the George Lucas juggernaut.
2115;I think the charm of this film is that it is a nerdy hero puts aside his pride and steps up to his duty and calling as a superhero.
2116;It is a very intimate and emotional movie that hits all the right butons.
2117;maguire plays Peter Parker perfectly.
2118;I am glad that they found an actor who actually looked and played the part, rather than taking Hollywood's flavor of the month.
2119;You believe that Parker is really a goof and a nerd, and you know that he revel in being Spiderman, the coolest of he cool.
2120;my favorite scene is Parker's epiphany, when he decides to take up the mantel and captures the man who killed his grandfather.
2121;kirsten Dunst play MJ well.
2122;Yet she manages to keep her head, and play a darn good scream queen to boot.
2123;She is the love interest, but is able to transcend the role and bring life.
2124;Seeing all of the behind the scenes clips enhances the film for me.
2125;I love the commentaries, and especially the gag reels.
2126;Buckaroo Banzai and X. men I have this feature, and I hope it catches on.
2127;i waited three years for it to come out and it was well worth the wait.
2128;tobey Macquire was perfect to play as spider.
2129;confidence, nearly everyone can identify with Pete, so we're more than ready to cheer him on when he suddenly gets some super.
2130;The wild ride is definitely worth the price of admission, and the special effects are awesome (although some are pretty obviously fake).
2131;In the movie his encounter with the spider gives him natural webbing.
2132;the action in the movie is great, although this is a flick with flaws.
2133;First off, Tobey McGuire is an AWESOME Peter Parker, and a ho.
2134;On the other hand, even though he looks nothing like Norman Osborn, Willem Dafoe is absolutely perfect as the Green Goblin (even though the costume looks very little like the comic book character).
2135;Other casting is well done, though.
2136;The print is beautiful and it has enough easter eggs to keep you busy for hours.
2137;It's a lot of fun, and you enjoy the story again and again (or at least until The Amazing Spider.
2138;When I first went to see this movie, I was stunned!
2139;I've experienced Superman, Batman, Blade and X. men, all right, and those were all jolly good movies.
2140;Well, there's some amazing action sequences, yes, plus a hero and a villain that are equally enjoyable to see.
2141;But there's also another side to the movie that really adds to the enjoyment.
2142;Spider Man is a human story, dealing with serious issues of loyalty, growing up, identity, and conscience.
2143;Taking that into account, Spider Man is rather moving, aside from being kick.
2144;all in all, this is a well made movie.
2145;It's got bawls AND heart!
2146;The CGI effects are amazing particularly when Spiderman swings from building to building.
2147;The people who play Peter and Mary Jane do a great job, but the Green Goblin actor takes the cake.
2148;The story is accurate to the comic which pleased me greatly.
2149;Still Hard to believe this one is over ten years old now.
2150;great cast, Toby is perfect as Peter Parker and Spidey.
2151;[We finally got this in Amazing SM].
2152;man is by far the best super.
2153;hero movie to be released in quite a while, the last truly good one being the ORIGINAL Batman, starring Michael Keaton.
2154;Just as Keaton did in Batman, Tobey Maguire brings a refreshingly human aspect to his character.
2155;Dunst, as Mary Jane, augments the emotional side of Maguire's Parker.
2156;man is a good movie with a great story behind it, and it has enough action to keep even the most difficult.
2157;This has to be one of the best super hero movies ever made, the dazzling special effects will blow you away.
2158;Perhaps that is why I enjoyed this movie so much.
2159;It brought me back to a time when I just loved being a kid.
2160;That's the brilliant thing about this movie.
2161;It reminds you that we have all been the geek or the loser at some point in our lives, but in the end, we always get the upper hand and become something great.
2162;in essence, this movie is fiction at its best.
2163;It makes you forget your troubles for a little while and leaves you with a good feeling.
2164;the storyline stays true to the comic, with the exception of Spidey's web.
2165;bang thrill ride that just cuts loose in front of you.
2166;i'm not giving this movie five stars because I'm a Spiderman fan, I'm giving five stars because it makes you feel great after you've watched it.
2167;by all means, watch this film.
2168;This movie was actually very good.
2169;Tobey Maguire was the most adorable super hero I've ever seen!
2170;disc set is chock full of extras and even without a home theater system, the discs will still play smoothly and loudly.
2171;Maguire, Dunst, Dafoe all played their roles magnificiently.
2172;man comics and Amazing Fantasy #15 and fans should be able to recognise them.
2173;OH MY GOD was this movie great!!!!!
2174;I tottaly loved it it's just that the part i didn't like was the frist kiss in the movie YUCK!!!!
2175;the movie was great it was even better in chinmark because it's the best theater ever!
2176;but if u beat the movie game well i beat it in 2 days it was so easy but very fun!
2177;well i hope u like the movie!
2178;man is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2179;Tobey Maguire did a great job portraying Peter Parker, smart and geeky, finally becoming the cool, confident super hero.
2180;man 2, because this movie has a predecessor.
2181;which is best in the two shots.
2182;Tobey Maguire excels as the ultimate Everyman superhero, capturing the full range of emotion as the character stumbles to transform from gawkish high school geek to media sensation to genuine hero.
2183;Willem Defoe is the perfect Norman Osborne
2184;The effects are brilliant, the production lavish, and the script surprisingly intelligent and literate.
2185;Moreover, the straightforward moral of the film.
2186;with great power comes great responsibility.
2187;is a welcome relief from the ugly amorality that too often fills modern comic books.
2188;Faithful to the comics from which it was spawned, Spider.
2189;It stayed with it's comic book roots, and combined it with realism of the world in which we live.
2190;Willam defoe was perfect as the green Goblin.
2191;Everyone should see this movie.
2192;I waited to see it since I saw the made for TV version in 1975.
2193;I saw that when I was 5 and 20 years later, justice has been done to one of the greatest super heroes to grace comics.
2194;goers later told me it was an excellent movie and I should watch with him (he wanted to watch it again.
2195;And so I did, and my reaction was one of pure amazement.
2196;first of all, the casting is excellent.
2197;Tobey Maguire made a great Spider.
2198;He played Peter Parker like Peter Parker should be.
2199;tongued witty sort of guy most super heroes are, but just a regular person who, of course, can mess up.
2200;He was able to make most of us cry, laugh, or just stare in awe at the person who had turned a 2D character into someone real.
2201;I thought Kirsten Dunst wasn't the right type of person for the part of M. j., but she played the role pretty well.
2202;The Green Goblin was the best of the actors and actresses.
2203;It's just sort of the regular good against evil sort of theme and everyone knows how that will end.
2204;I did liked how the director didn't make the entire movie about the action and the explosives and the kicking and the leaping from bombed buildings and all that extra action stuff some people add to their movies to increase an audience's excitement level.
2205;The impression the audience gets in certain parts is, Wow.
2206;I was really affected by the harshness of both fighters, and it was of course exciting because, even though the death of Spider.
2207;I also enjoyed and understood the ending when Parker turned down MJ.
2208;It was an act of personal sacrifice, and it sort of celebrated the goodness of Peter Parker, further distinguishing the line between good and evil.
2209;And thankfully the latest superhero film is right up there with the greats.
2210;Kirsten Dunst is good as his love interest.
2211;Throughout the film's running time, the action set pieces are well paced and inventive.
2212;The action is brilliantly done and thrilling, and the CGI blends seamlessly with the live action stunts.
2213;fans of the comic will not be disappointed, for the film stays true to it's origins, yet has enough adventure to make it new and attention.
2214;Director Sam Raimi (the Evil Dead films) has created a world, which is fun and adventurous.
2215;And Raimi sometimes goes a bit far with the retina.
2216;munching entertainment, with enough action and FX to satisfy audiences.
2217;I can find the regular edition of this Blu.
2218;I placed my order because it shows the Blu.
2219;I received the regular copy of the Blu.
2220;this is a great one to get if you like the comic book of spider man.
2221;This is a great movie.
2222;It has great acting(William Dafoe was the perfect choice for the Green Goblin) Sam Raimi is also a great director and probably one of the few who could take the comic book Spiderman and adapt it to the Big screen.
2223;The shots of Spidey swinging through New York are sweet.
2224;Overall this is the best superhero franchise so far, although Batman is making a comeback with Batman Begins, after so many lousy superhero movies its refreshing to have a great movie like this.
2225;The end result of a campaign that lasted almost 20 years, the movie was well worth the wait.
2226;if you're going to steal, steal from the best!
2227;I'm female, so I like heart with my action movies, and this movie has the perfect balance.
2228;Spiderman has to be one of the best comic book to big screen adaptations to come out in quite some time.
2229;Everybody of course knows the standard plot line with Spiderman.
2230;He has of course the woman he's seriously in love with in the stunningly beautiful Kirsten Dunst.
2231;We see him going through the learning process of how to become Spiderman and use his newfound powers which is hilarious and amazing.
2232;Willem Dafoe's performance is absolutely wonderful and probably the best acting job I've seen him do in some time.
2233;The fight scenes in this movie are right up there with The Matrix.
2234;This is an emotionally uplifting and wonderful movie that you can take your family to and everybody will enjoy!
2235;The second disk has scores of extra stuff with something of interest for everybody.
2236;This is truly an example of how special effects have grown in recent years.
2237;The actors do an excellent job of not making the story look campy.
2238;Yes, the plot is a little thin, but I really enjoyed watching Spiderman fly through the city.
2239;i loved the animated version of Spiderman as a child.
2240;This is a great introduction to what will hopefully be a great series of Spiderman movies to come.
2241;My son is finally old enough to where I could introduce him to this classic movie that I really enjoyed too!
2242;It was intriguing, beguiling, a dream within a dream come true.
2243;And now, it's just that, a dream come true.
2244;sam Raimi, along with the talents of Tobey Maguire, Kristin Dunst, and Willem Dafoe, all courtesey of the colorful imagination of Stan Lee, have created the best comic book movie adaptation (dare I say it, ok.)
2245;Sam Raimi certainly had a definite vision for Spider.
2246;He faithfully recreates a hyper.
2247;man onscreen is simply flawless.
2248;Pure escapist fiction, comic books superheroes and exploits come to life.
2249;Character and plot development, (the tormented superhero, and average joe who must struggle with the great power he has acquired and the great responsibility that he must deal with) along with exceptional talent and a director with a keen eye for the action flick to boot.
2250;Simply, it's pure movie magic.You're a Spidey fan, and to see these characters come to life on the screen, in such an excellent manner, and it's just TOO much.
2251;man stands alone by itself a remarkable picture.
2252;man, the comic book, the hero, the man, come to life.
2253;It was a great movie I thought!
2254;man I HIGHLY recommend X. men, a great movie as well as an excellent adaption from a comic series.
2255;It's a good adaptation of a comic book, with dialogue that doesn't insult the intelligence of adults, but which can also be enjoyed by younger viewers.
2256;Violence, cliches catchphrases, excellent special effects and a tenuous storyline!Fortunately however, the action scenes are slick
2257;and the dialogue fairly slick.
2258;paced, and though not deep, insightful (or indeed meaningful!)
2259;Maguire makes a brave attempt at being the genetically altered Peter Parker, called upon by his sense of moral justice to clear up the city after his Uncle is killed by a robber.
2260;dunst puts in an average performance as his beautiful girl.
2261;Some fairly good acting, well coreographed fight scenes and a pleasant all round film.
2262;i find myself awaiting the next film with a certain amount of anticipation!
2263;Some necessary editing caused a delay in the release, but it was worth the wait.
2264;And we now settle in for a super cinematic treat.
2265;i thought the Goblin was kind of goofy.
2266;stop action, thrills, and spills, Arachnoid.
2267;On this score I believe the credit goes to director Sam Raimi, but there is always the possibility David Koepp's screenplay might have had something to do with it (note: Stan Lee and Steve Ditko get credit for creating Spider.
2268;While this works for the ability to cling to walls and the good old spider.
2269;I mean, on the one hand, the invention of his special web fluid was how we knew Peter was a brilliant young scientist, while on the other, how does the web go through the costume?
2270;the casting is fine, although Rosemary Harris never looks as frail as we all remember Aunt May.
2271;Tobey Maguire tends to keep things a bit too sedate with MJ after his transformation, but there is undeniable chemistry between him and Kirsten Dunst at key moments in the film.
2272;Willem Dafoe does some of his best acting opposite himself (you will see), and James Franco does a nice job of reinventing Harry Osborn for the modern world.
2273;Look real quick to spot Stan Lee in this film.
2274;man is one of those films you give 4.5 stars, because it manages to surpass expectations in some key regards while still needing to be improved in some other areas.
2275;My daughter loves all the Spiderman movies and I bought her one through three for Christmas.
2276;if u like super hero movies this one is a good origin about how he first got his powers n then started fighting crime.
2277;I just got back from seeing Spider.
2278;i found the movie to be well put.
2279;genius nemesis for the movie.
2280;I just saw the movie yesterday and it's great!
2281;This movie tells the story of how Peter Parker, a nerdy (and therefore smart) kid, turns into Spiderman, the (probably still) smart, cool hero.
2282;Tobey Maguire is great as Spiderman because he looks good.
2283;Well whoever it is in there looks nice as well.
2284;The special effects are really great to watch, probably the best part of the movie.
2285;It's just a really fun movie, especially the swing from building to building and the launching spider webs parts.
2286;Go see it for great entertainment!
2287;Its not a horrible movie, but the only redeeming value in this movie is the special effects, the action, and the bonus features if you're into that kind of thing.
2288;Incredible special effects in this vivid telling of how Spider.
2289;Maguire is good in the lead.
2290;All style and no substance, but it does do a good job of explaining the character's history.
2291;No one who reads the original Marvel comics will remember Spidey getting in the ring with Macho Man (but then again, they've probably never heard of the EVIL DEAD, which would be a blessing if they haven't), but this film is a worthy companion to the excellent animated series produced in the 90s upon which its based.
2292;Spiderman was GREAT, and that is a very pleasant surprise considering that I've been a fan for as long as I can remember, and thus did not know what to expect from the film.
2293;the movie combines action, adventure and comedy.
2294;Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding, making this movie one of the best of its kind.
2295;The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.
2296;The story line was impeccable, and so were the special effects.
2297;There was just enough romance to keep the interest of my completely female brain.
2298;At the very least, it will entertain you for a while.
2299;to my surprise I actually enjoyed it very much, it had content, action, teary bits and yes whats a superheroes film without saving people.
2300;so as a superhero standard it has it all.
2301;afterall this is a comic made into movie.
2302;the story is very involving and i think in any superheroe film there should be theme or punch line in spiderman's case its WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBLITY!
2303;i guess these days all special effects are done very well impressive indeed.
2304;Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst puts on a good and solid acting thats believable and dramatic.
2305;overall this film is very entertaining to watch this is a film made for fans and to make lots of money all of its qualities and end suggests a sequeal and spiderman has been very sucessful at the box office making millions so it should but thats all it will do for me a good 2 hour of entertainment.
2306;however watching the hulk has giving me a everlasting experience and spiderman only 2.
2307;But I knew I would love this movie, well me being compelled to anything with true and pure raw or unveiled emotions.
2308;There were deep emotional connections with each main character.
2309;I heard their supposed to make 2 more, I dunno how they can top this one, but I'd love to see it done, or at least just as good!!!
2310;, thoughtfull, good strong charcters, and well its just plain good!!!
2311;So *enjoy*, I honestly *HOPE* you will!!!
2312;I have to admit, I thought going in that it was going to be like X. men and they were going to change everything.
2313;I felt like beating myself up afterwards.
2314;That is the best superhero movie of all time!!
2315;I think that another reason it was so good was that Stan Lee helped make it.
2316;This movie was exciting and the special effects captivating.
2317;Kristen Dunst was ok but what really was captivating was what was going on in the battle of Good and Evil.
2318;The whole movie was excellent and they left a door open for a sequel which I eagerly look forward to.
2319;I thought that this movie was great.
2320;Tobey Maguire is was great as Peter Parker and Spider.
2321;The best part was the first hour.
2322;This movie is entertainment .
2323;This movie is for all ages and entertainment levels.
2324;Get together with some friends, put the movie in and have a great time!
2325;Spiderman was a decent and enjoyable movie, but still suffers from the curse of the superheroe movies.
2326;Every time a book or comic transitions into a movie people complain when they make changes.
2327;Spiderman himself looked pretty good, in that he didnt look like a complete idiot in his spandex suit.
2328;I also dont really like comics being made into movies because, well.
2329;still this movie had many good points.
2330;It was generally an enjoyable experience.
2331;And watching it once will probably be atleast somewhat enjoyable for most fans.
2332;i cant give it 4 stars but it gets a solid 3 stars for sure.
2333;He is kind of geeky, more than a little shy, and really nice.
2334;Of course he is also very good at science.
2335;Peter goes on a field trip to a laboratory doing interesting genetic experiments on spiders, and one happens to have escaped during Peter's field trip.
2336;Soon Peter discovers that he is really strong, and can shoot webs out his wrists, and can climb walls with his bare hands.
2337;As those of us familiar with the superhero genre know, there is a lot of angst in the superhero world.
2338;peter also has yearnings for the beautiful redheaded girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).
2339;The Green Goblin has a cool sort of Jet Ski for the air that emits a smoky trail, so that environmentalists will hate him since clearly it is the good spider versus the evil industrialist.
2340;as corny as the plot sounds, this movie is highly entertaining and enjoyable.
2341;The computer generated images are well done, with some of the scenes approaching phenomenal.
2342;man comics to enjoy this movie.
2343;Tobey Maguire can act, as evidenced by his phenomenal role in Seabiscuit, and he does well in this movie.
2344;While there were a few places where I was a little frustrated, I think it was because Peter Parker was less predictable in this movie than I would have expected from the comics, and that is a very good thing.
2345;Kurstin Dunst is totally believable as his girlfriend Jane!
2346;Need I say more!Sam Rami did an exciting job with the technical and emotional strings of this film.
2347;He through in action, adventure, special effects and some great stunts in the origins of Peter Parker (aka SPIDERMAN).
2348;It has a great story .
2349;nothing new or innovative, but definately believable.
2350;even William Dafoe looked like he had a great time as the villian and above all that the love story was wonderful and refreshing.
2351;This movie is fun for the whole family and the Peter Parker narative that opens and closes the movies makes your feel like the next Comic Book (movie .
2352;lets just say, when Spidey swings into action, the movie shoots in high gear.
2353;Loved this movie, and like it was said before, and will be said again, the kiss was totally classic.
2354;Loved the soundtrack to this movie, as well!!!
2355;It definitely kept me engrossed with the visualizations and interesting storyline.
2356;Received in perfect condition, and quick and easy transaction.
2357;screen treatment at last, but disappoints not only comic book afficiondos but fans of director Sam Raimi as well, and in a rare feat for Hollywood, SPIDER.
2358;convincing CGI performance of the past year belongs to Sarah Michelle Gellar in SCOOBY.
2359;X. mEN is a far better film and cost a lot less to make.
2360;Sam Raimi, underrated director of Darkman and a little gem called The Gift, has proved his mettle in the world of the blockbuster.
2361;Believe that Spiderman will clean up in every city in the US and also have a great ride internationally.
2362;Cinematography and special effects are phenomenal, Danny Elfman's music is outstanding.
2363;New York City is surreal, and yet the main characters are believable as natives from Queens.
2364;casting Tobey McGuire as Parker/Spiderman was a thoughtful choice, and helped to keep the film close to the origins of the Marvel comic.
2365;You have to enjoy your evilness to get the laughs and bring a cartoon villain to life.
2366;still a great film
2367;Toby did a wonderful job on this one also.
2368;The special effects were great and the cast did and excellent job
2369;there really are two movies here.
2370;This part is great, really funny and original and Tobey McGuire is exceptional.
2371;the second is your standard comic book action flick, which is good, filled with action, great set design and all the rest but I felt dropped down a notch from the first half.
2372;all of the supporting cast is great with one particular nod to James Franco as Parkers best friend and son of Spideys arch nemesis .
2373;he really pulls off the inadequete rich boy to a tee and I hope he will be in the sequel.
2374;Well, maybe I should leave out The Matrix and X. men, which were great entertainment flicks.
2375;But here is one of the best movies of 2002: Spider.
2376;this is perhaps the best popcorn movie I've seen in years.
2377;Great performers, great characters, fantastic story.
2378;It's got almost everything that a good piece of entertainment should have.
2379;played here to flawless perfection by Tobey Maguire .
2380;who is stung by a super radioactive spider, and his life is changed forever.
2381;chewing performance), is fantastic considering the bond between their corresponding alter.
2382;I really love this movie.
2383;And I wasn't mistaken: this film is better than Episode II.
2384;this is a good movie.
2385;I have always been a dc and marvel fan.
2386;The origin story is pretty close to the original comic book, and Toby Maguire plays the character perfectly.
2387;Willem Dafoe plays a perfect psycho.
2388;The costumes are fantastic and the special effects are amazing (pun not intended).
2389;In all Spiderman is a great film and a wonderful corner stone for this trilogy.
2390;man is one of the best superhero marvel movie's I have ever saw.
2391;okay Tobey Maguire is pretty cheesey at the beginning but does get better.
2392;i think the special effects are awsome and so real,you won't belive how they did it.
2393;the actors are great in this movie and not cheesey like Tobey Maguire was at the beginning.
2394;all the reviewr's say it's great,I say it's great, obviously it's good.
2395;You are going to love it.
2396;Amazing action scenes in this film.
2397;Funny at times and well packaged.
2398;This is the best comic book movie to date.
2399;Toby Macguire's and Kristen Dunst's best proformance yet!
2400;Your in for a rollercoaster of a good time!
2401;Between Spider Man and Star Wars it's going to be close.
2402;Star Wars seems to be a great movie and this was a great movie!
2403;for one of the best movies of the year so far.
2404;For a superhero movie, this film has great character development.
2405;You really care about lives of the characters in this film.
2406;aCtion is also great and special effects are also great.
2407;man then you'll love this movie.
2408;man, you'll love this movie.
2409;We all loved this movie.
2410;The CGI is at times obvious, especially when Peter Parker is first enjoying his new found abilities, but that is forgiven by the totally awesome closing sequence.
2411;Just before the end titles, there is a final sequence showing Spidey, up close, swinging through New York which is truly amazing, and in my opinion flawless.
2412;from the acting standpoint Tobey Maguire really delivers, as does Willem Defoe.
2413;This was such an enjoyable two hours, that I am going to see it again tonight, and I just can't wait to see that closing sequence again.
2414;a lot like the books and comics,a few minor differences,excellent show,i look for more.
2415;I was surprised to find I enjoyed this movie even more than Attack of the Clones.
2416;and I'm a big Star Wars fan.
2417;And partly it was the fact that this was a more intimate movie than Attack of the Clones, since it concentrates on many fewer personalities and goes much more into the development of the Peter Parker character and his immediate family and friends (as well as his enemies).
2418;the movie does a great job of realizing Spiderman's abilities, which are put to good effect in the movie.
2419;The fight scenes with the Green Goblin are really well done, and the movie seems to succeed without nearly the amount of special effects that the Star Wars movies are using.
2420;In the original comic strip, Peter acquires his amazing abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.
2421;all in all a great movie for the summer.
2422;It was fabulous and fun the first time around, but difficult to watch the second.
2423;this is a movie that revels in the making Spider.
2424;man's powers look and feel as cool as you imagined them as a child (if you were a fan of the comic book or the original animated series), and adds enough romance to widen the appeal beyond fan.
2425;Some of the special effects are not terribly realistic, but that only adds to the fun.
2426;Tobey Maguire is the best actor ever!!!!!!!
2427;i really really really enjoyed and loved it.
2428;he's such a wonderful and talented actor.
2429;as long as he stays on this earth,i will always like hime.
2430;im going to see his movie,Spider.
2431;I'm big fan of Spider.
2432;With the recent adaptation of comic book heroes for movies with big budgets, I was looking forward to this film.
2433;spiderman was a great film that had amazing action, a good story, told Spiderman's history pretty close to the original comic and entertained my fianc e with a romance in it we weren't expecting.
2434;the acting was very good, writing superb, and the action was great.
2435;A fine film that everyone could enjoy (over 12 years old).
2436;She really enjoyed this film too.
2437;the movie draws you in from start to finish like a roller coaster ride.
2438;Very much enjoyed it and would recommend to others.
2439;man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie.
2440;I was very happy, the item was shipped on time and in the condition promised.
2441;Spiderman was an excellent movie.
2442;The action and special effects were simply superb.
2443;It had a good and reasonable plot and would appeal to people of any taste.
2444;Even people who like romance movies will like the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson.
2445;The action scenes between Green Goblin and Spiderman will definitely make this movie something to be remembered.
2446;This movie was better than even the Xmen in my opinion and I liked the Xmen.
2447;The success of this movie will also make it possible for other superhero movies to make it to the theater.
2448;The Hulk, Ironman, Fantastic Four, Xmen 2, and the Spiderman sequal just to name a few.
2449;but if you are a fan of mind warping, astonishing visual effects and Hollywood's storytelling.
2450;With great power comes great responsibility.That line is the theme for the comic book adaption of the web.
2451;Peter dreams of being popular, having a cool car and being the boyfriend of popular girl Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst), his next door neighbor.
2452;the movie has a great story to it.
2453;It's amazing how this once vulnerable boy becomes a brave hero almost overnight.
2454;Once you transform into an adult you have great responsibilities and Spider.
2455;man carries that message well.
2456;William Dafoe is magnificent as Norman Osbourne.
2457;There's one scene where Norman confronts his other personality and Dafoe delivers it very well.
2458;there's also a love story between Mary Jane and Spider.
2459;Mary Jane is in love with Spider.
2460;Mary Jane is an aspiring stage actress and Kirsten Dunst actually plays the character very well.
2461;There's also a scene that's copied right out of the Matrix.
2462;The menace Dafoe delivers is gone once he puts on the goofy Halloween costume.
2463;man is the classic and simple story of nerd.
2464;hero with some good performances and some good action.
2465;Fans will defiantly be pleased and non.
2466;My roommate in college was a comic geek, and I was inundated by the life and times of.
2467;It captures the spirit, and some of the wow factor of becoming and being a superhero while maintaining a near.
2468;spidey has always been one of the most human and accessible of the pulp do.
2469;Maguire captures this struggle well, even if he isn't my perfect Spider.
2470;Lots of history, outtakes, and interviews at an attractive price.
2471;I was very pleased with it, and I'm sure you will be too.
2472;This is an excellent movie!
2473;This one still stands well on its own as a beginning into Peter Parker's superhero life.
2474;I still think Tobey McGuire is great as Peter and as Spider.
2475;This movie shipped quickly arrived in a great condition and was decent to watch.
2476;I am happy with this product I would recommend it again.
2477;Spiderman is a perfect example of why I must continue to insist on this guideline.
2478;This is a movie geared toward adults, and as an adult, I found it very entertaining.
2479;I loved the special effects.
2480;I loved watching Spiderman soar through the skies and use his special powers.
2481;I enjoyed the conflict between characters, although I found the save the girl routines a bit melodramatic and unoriginal.
2482;Any real fan of stan lee's spider man must have this gift set version.
2483;besides all goodies found in the regular widescreen (such as making.
2484;Yet he's also aware that keeping who he has become a secret is highly important to the safety of his friends and family.
2485;I also enjoyed the Jekyll/Hyde relationship that Norman had with the Green Goblin.
2486;That was filmed and written well, making the villain slightly sympathetic himself.
2487;The actors do a wonderful job of drawing me in and making me care for the characters.
2488;The film is preserved with clear picture and sound.
2489;The commentaries are interesting and there are loads of behind the scenes things to go through.
2490;man comics, so I found the sections on the character especially fascinating.
2491;this movie tempers its action with wonderful heart, making it a truly likeable film.
2492;Sam Raimi did a descent job keeping it entertaining though.
2493;This is a far better version of Spider.
2494;This modern version is light years better and thank GOD Marvel did it right!
2495;Right up there with the Fantastic Four or the Hulk!
2496;In this movie, Parker first gets his powers and fights his first super villain.
2497;If you've ever liked the character in comics or animation, this is a must have!
2498;All good when it came thorough the mail.
2499;Most people who fantasize about being a costumed superhero usually focus on the upside of super powers: extraordinary strength, zooming through the air, and the adoration of fans.
2500;But in Parker's case, he has the advantage of his wise Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who warns him that with great power comes great responsibility.
2501;much of the charm of SPIDERMAN is visual.
2502;There are numerous scenes of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin launching themselves through space and from building to building.
2503;The scenes that accompany this visual treat bring to mind the similar scenes that Superman and Lois Lane played out in the earlier SUPERMAN movies, where Christopher Reeve saved Margot Kidder from falling from a skyscraper.
2504;Parker's romantic interest is Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who is both sweet and believable as a young lady who drifts from one man to another until she discovers that her true love (Parker) has always been right there for her.
2505;Those like Peter Parker make the right choice and can still live a relatively normal life.
2506;Yeah the movie is great, I think it is going to be a blockbuster.
2507;Toby Maguire, he fits in naturally into Spidey's character, he does not over act has a wry sense of humor with a controlled emotional element.
2508;He is the right choice, but Kirsten Dunst ( a good looker indeed) well I think she is there just to add a female sparkle.
2509;technically I think the special effects are good but could have been much better.
2510;i went to watch Spiderman without any expectations and I can say that overall I am pleased with the whole package.
2511;excellence movie BUT a great fun movie with entertainment.
2512;One of the most important things for taken a comic book to the big screen is that the director.
2513;It's shows by this movie.
2514;Toby is a great Peter Parker.
2515;Willem Dafoe did a great job as the Green Goblin.
2516;He was everything you would imagine about the character!If you are a big fan then this set is great for the extras.
2517;a great film and you won't tire watching it!
2518;The chemistry between him and Kirsten Dunst was excellent.
2519;William Dafoe as the Green Goblin was one of the best casting ideas ever because he made the Goblin seemed like one of the most maniacal super.
2520;One of the best sequences in the movie is when he learns of his powers and uses them to enter a wrestling match and get $3000 to beat Bonesaw.
2521;I am a fan of the Spiderman comic books, and I was incredibly satisfied with the way Spiderman the movie turned out.
2522;man because now i can actually enjoy the full movie experience, with the special features and what not.
2523;This movie has one of the best mixtures of comic book cheese and reality based acting i have ever seen!
2524;It was completely fun, as it should be, because this is what we go to the movies for .
2525;but i found it extremely enjoyable even with the added comic bookiness.
2526;Sam Raimi is THE man!
2527;I was impressed and loved that Sam Rami did that.
2528;A comic book movie has to stay true to its roots.
2529;If it doesn't it disrespects how it got to the big screen.
2530;tobey Maguire was a good Spiderman and Peter Parker.
2531;He developed the character well and was most of all believable as Spiderman.
2532;She looks great in the movie.
2533;It's a better role for her than some of the ones she has played in the past.
2534;Her and Tobey have good chemistry together, but this is one of the places that I thought the movie got itself in some trouble.
2535;william Dafoe was a perfect Green Goblin.
2536;He impressed me a lot in the movie.
2537;The guy has always come off to me as an intense actor.
2538;He plays an intense character and does it well.
2539;I also loved the shape the guy was in.
2540;Both him and Tobey got in amazing physical shape to play there roles.
2541;I felt they should have put more hand to hand action in there.
2542;Spiderman when he web slinged was impressive.
2543;He look as real as a Spiderman could.
2544;I own and I like it, I feel you will too.
2545;man is pure entertainment It buzzes along, quickly taking us from one thrilling moment to the next.
2546;The movie seems to as much fun to people like myself who
2547;tobey Macguire was the perfect choice to play Spider.
2548;His quiet persona and his decent.
2549;great looks make his transformation exceptionally appealing.
2550;There is something about his performance that is quite touching, thus making his character a superhero that people can actually relate to.
2551;Kirsten Dunst, one of our greatest young actresses, is perfect as Mary Jane.
2552;Willem Dafoe makes a marvelous villain.
2553;man' does a fine job of introducing our web slinging hero as well as the character of Peter Parker.
2554;Tobey Maguire captures Peter's personality well, in that he is able to convey his insecurities and helplessness in the beginning of the film.
2555;He also does an excellent job of showing Peter's newly found confidence thanks to his new superpowers.
2556;other than a few necessary inaccuracies (i. e. natural web shooting without Parker's self made web shooters), the movie stays true to the comic book both in its plot and in its character portrayal.
2557;finally, the ending does the movie justice and sets up for an exciting sequel.
2558;I have been a big Spider Man fan and have read many of the comics so still being a true fan I went to see the movie when released at theatres and when all was over Spider Man was one of the best movies I have seen in some time.
2559;Now in the comics Gwen Stacy the true love of Peter Parker before Mary Jane Watson never existed to the movies story.
2560;There was some other changes to the movie from comics such as Flash Thompson the bully to Peter Parker though being in the comic a best friend but all in all Spider Man was action packed with a great story line.
2561;An above average movie version of a comic book superhero.
2562;It is fun, exciting, and pretty true to the source material.
2563;Toby Maguire does do a good job with Peter Parker, and Aunt May and Uncle Ben are both well.
2564;There is both good conflict and good comic relief in the form of Flash Johnson and J. Jonah Janeson.
2565;while I am an avid comic book fan, and I enjoy the occasional Spider.
2566;man has never really hooked me.
2567;This movie felt the same way: an enjoyable story and some good characters, but that's about it.
2568;There was plenty to enjoy in this film.
2569;The action sequences were good, and I felt that the character was treated fairly well.
2570;man 2, I'd discovered that it was POINTLESS to create the first Spider.
2571;This film has many powerful scenes, the death of Uncle Ben, Spider.
2572;It was a great summer, women, going to high school, but I was afraid that Spider.
2573;Oh I forgot, he hasn't directed a film in 8 or 7 years, and it still seems that James is still in love with himself, I mean he's acheived everything that he ever wanted to acheive in cinema.
2574;I walked in the movie and I was suprised, I was actually happy to see a film, I hadn't felt that way in years.
2575;I sat in my seat, the lights got dimed and the film began.
2576;I don't get as excited about a man swinging around a cityscape in tights as I would have at age eleven, but Raimi's film version of the classic Marvel comic character stands as one of the best film translations of a comic book to date.
2577;He manages to weave the classic Spider.
2578;man origin story with an effective plotline, well.
2579;man 2 trailers piqued our interest.
2580;Tobey Maguire is an inspired choice for the mild.
2581;Great SFX, AWESOME soundtrack, good plot.
2582;My grandson requested this movie, and we really enjoyed watching it together.
2583;Just the kind of adventure a little kid likes without being dark like Batman.
2584;This movie deviates in some parts from the canon established by the comics, but it is still worth watching.
2585;The movie has some pretty great effects, and Tobey does a nice job in his role as Peter Parker.
2586;The important parts of the comic book are adhered to .
2587;Uncle Ben's death, the radioactive spider, etc.
2588;If you also liked the TV show, you should enjoy this.
2589;My favorite part of the movie, Go get 'em tiger!
2590;This is a great action movie.
2591;As an adult, I enjoyed it.
2592;It is full of the good stuff that makes us feel good and makes us want to watch it over and over again.
2593;It is very humorous, action packed, and dramatic.
2594;the second one is also very impressive!
2595;kirsten Dunst struck the right chord as Mary Jane Watson, although she comes across as a bit of a damsel in distress.
2596;She'll hopefully have a bigger part in the sequel .
2597;man
2598;So you better go see it
2599;I was pleasantly surprised to find that CGI effects have improved greatly.
2600;Although it is still noticable when a digital actor is performing a stunt, the CGI actors are quite well.
2601;I was also pleased to see that many fo the stunts were done by the actors themselves .
2602;It's nice to see that the makers of this film didn't go overboard with all of the effects, remembering that there has to be some acting and a storyline to make the film worth seeing.
2603;Some of the story was altered in a way to make this a modernized version of the comic book tale.
2604;despite some of the changes made to the original story, I loved this film.
2605;I especially liked seeing a more in.
2606;depth look at Mary Jane's life outside of the in.
2607;Tobey Maguire's portrayal as the class.
2608;Kirsten Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane.
2609;No one will ever top this portrayal of the Green Goblin!
2610;This is one of the most awesome movies Iv'e seen in a long time.
2611;I love everything about it.
2612;After watching the Superman and Batman movies I was thrilled to see Spiderman brought to the screen.
2613;This childhood hero ofmine was brought to life by Stan Lee in the 1960's in comin book form.
2614;Spiderman(Peter Parker) is well played by Toby Maguire.
2615;he is able to climb walls and obtains superhuman strength.
2616;he rescues a lovely lady portrayed byKirsten Dirst.
2617;another strong role in the movie is the character of the Green Goblin played by William Dafoe.
2618;The scenery and the special effects in this movie are beyond compare.
2619;the fight scenes between Spiderman and the Green Goblin are spectacular.
2620;An outstanding movie that I enjoyed.
2621;Without a doubt one of the best comic book movies ever!
2622;Tobey Maguire did a fine job as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst's performance was excellent.
2623;In 2002, theater audiences were treated to what is arguably one of the best superhero.
2624;inspired films of all time, Spider.
2625;enhanced physical abilities, while Norman Osborn develops a power.
2626;with dazzling special effects, good acting and a well.
2627;Tobey Maguire effectively brought to the big.
2628;man with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to any fantasy/superhero aficionado.
2629;Spiderman is a movie you have to see twice!
2630;It has really good graphics when spiderman is swing from buliding to bulding.
2631;It also has a great plot.
2632;Everything in this movie is great 10x better then the cartoons.
2633;It took many years to get this project done and it certainly delivers as not only a great super hero story but a great film in general that has something to please all movie.
2634;From Peter's relationships with his Uncle and Aunt, his persuit of Mary Jane, and the valuable lesson he learns when he abuses his powers (with great power comes great responsibility).
2635;the special effects were amazing and the choice of the Green Goblin as the tortured Norman Osbourn was perfect.
2636;All I have to say is.
2637;makers get the story and characters right, staying true to the comic.
2638;it helps that Sam Raimi is a Spider.
2639;(Raimi updated the story to the new millenium from the 1960's comic.
2640;Most viewers and ALL comic.
2641;book fans will enjoy this movie.
2642;Well, with all respect, if you feel that comic.
2643;But if you want a mature approach to fantasy and action.
2644;adventure, then this movie is a dream come true!Let's see if Daredevil and The Hulk, scheduled for next year, will be just as good.
2645;hero movie made to date, Spider.
2646;man delivers on the hype with an updated and interesting take on the wall.
2647;crawler's origin and a wonderful performance from both Toby Maguire as Spidey/Peter Parker and Wilem Dafoe as the nemesis Green Goblin/Norman Osborn.
2648;the characters seem to stay true to their classic motivations as backed up by some 40.
2649;There is something for all movie fans in this film, as the love.
2650;jane Watson provides nice counterpoint to the battle scenes with Spider.
2651;His part is fun and funny.
2652;it seemed like all the actors were having a good time with this project and it shows in the performances.
2653;good old fashioned comic book brought to life with Tobey Maguire, key as Peter Parker, but it sorta thins out in areas.
2654;a must see for fans though
2655;While many critics complained that the CGI effects made the movie seem more like a video game, I found the effects jawdropping, awesome and quite fun.
2656;paced, lively direction perfectly propels the comic book hero onto the big screen.
2657;Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker, showing his immense range (see Seabiscuit, Pleasantville ), and Kirsten Dunst radiates not only a beautiful physical presence, but the quite seductive beauty of a girl becoming a woman.
2658;Willem Dafoe is the perfect archvillain, although it seems at times he gets too much the best of our hero, but in the end, spidey prevails.
2659;the whole production works mainly because of the heart the cast puts in, and the amazing effects.
2660;Love the DC comic move to bring things to life.
2661;Superbit movie is great on the new digital devices.
2662;Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider.
2663;kirsten Dunst, likewise, is terrific as Mary Jane Watson.
2664;man as there always seems to be with blockbusters like this.
2665;Maguire, Dunst, Harris as Aunt May, Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne are all perfectly cast and show that a film can have all the latest technical wizardry, but still must depend on its actors to flesh out the characters and make the audience believe and care about what happens to them.
2666;Anxiously awaited by both comic and cartoon fans alike, Sam Raimi brings the extremely popular 'Spider.
2667;man' to life on the big screen which is true.
2668;form and a very rewarding rendition of this much adored action hero.
2669;Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast and admirably pulls off the dual role of shy newsboy by day, crime.
2670;fighter extraordinaire by night with style and grace.
2671;Kirsten Dunst is equally endearing as Spidey's gal pal as there are more than one Kodak moments shared between the two which no doubt will be archived in cinematic annals if romance fans have their vote.
2672;enemy Green Goblin, effectively played by veteran actor Willem Dafoe, which provides the many suspenseful twists and turns evidenced in their high.
2673;ego (the mild mannered newsboy Peter Parker) adds additional intrigue as he entangles with envious friend and rival Robert Franco for the affection of sweetheart Dunst, it is the humorous (borderline silly but still funny) antics provided by J. k. Simmons as Peter Parker's Daily Bugle boss that contributes a huge amount of laughs in this enjoyable adventure that certainly sets the standard for first rate comic book to big screen transitions.
2674;The movie mainly introduces us to Peter Parker and how Spiderman came to be and how the murder of his Uncle Ben was the main turning point to become the hero Spiderman.
2675;The movie does stay focus
2676;As a fan of the Original Batman and Superman, this was a nice comic.
2677;In Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's The Amazing Fantasy we learn of the super hero and his origin.
2678;A twist from the film, Parker actually engineers web spinners with new cartridges to replace older.
2679;From one he found out it was the thief that killed his uncle, he made a pledge to follow Uncle Ben's statement, with great power, comes great responsibility.
2680;In fact it seemed more realistic, as I always gawked at the fact that a radioactivity lab would be produced for the likes of high school students.
2681;I was quite surprised Thompson would even be in it, but the addition of him in it added a great variety of scenes.
2682;The whole film centralizes very well on each character as the film is basically the carving of the series.
2683;It's the true form of which Spider.
2684;Parker's and Osborne's transitions were so wonderfully and delicately played out, you really felt for the characters and understood them to their maximum potential.
2685;But this transition made her stronger and much more believable.
2686;But as mentioned before, I've read the comics, and I can assure you it's very true and very entertaining.
2687;Seeing Peter's teen angst against Uncle Ben was so remarkable and relatable.
2688;Mary Jane's troubled home life and Parker's resilience to let himself open up was so valid.
2689;The directing and writing of the film was also captured brilliantly.
2690;David Koepp took the comics to script(with help from Cameron's treatment ) and made what is thee best super hero film ever.
2691;The people were so realistic and the underlines of Norman Osborne's 'change' were scary and ominous.
2692;The writing really helped the film and even added some very memorable, creepy moments.
2693;His on the target directing provided some really beautiful shots, especially the ending, that put this film number one for me.
2694;The transitions, cinematography, action, etc were all so wonderfully strewn together as if a part of a web itself!
2695;as always, I'm going to congratulate Danny Elfman on a superb score for the film.
2696;His work on Men In Black , Good Will Hunting , Batman , etc have all had that eerie, yet unknown sense.
2697;The contraptions of Norman's sleek, sly and outlandish look were so overly enthralling due to the music that Elfman constructed.
2698;He captured the moment in each scene and I really feel he was the best choice for the film and should be duly noted.
2699;the themes from the books themselves are quite essential and very valuable to myself.
2700;man has and always will be my favorite super hero of all time.
2701;I would do anything to be in that position and to think of something like that really shows how believable and relatable the character can be.
2702;The movie itself moved me, physically as I moved around in the seats with excitement and fear.
2703;For a super hero movie, which I hate to regard them as, this film takes the cake in the category.
2704;Thee best film I have seen in a long while and probably one of the more memorable ones as well.
2705;I not only recommend you to see this film, but I urge you to see it.
2706;This movie was very good, it had a great cast that complimented eachother.
2707;Amazon's service is great .
2708;It has a great story line and has something for everyone .
2709;The movie industry has worked hard to make their movies more appealing to a wider audience, and they hit a home run with this one.
2710;It is thanks to the successes of films like Blade and X. men that finally pushed one of most highly anticipated comic.
2711;But all the built up anticipation will find a rest as the famous comic.
2712;book superhero makes his way to big screen for the first time ever being played by a relatively unknown young actor.
2713;Either way, it will be an exciting ride for all those involved.
2714;the story centers on the life of the young Peter Parker and the origin of the now famous comic.
2715;man, the new superhero must master his abilities perfectly to take down the Green Goblin, who is actually his best friend's father who goes insane from an experiment gone wrong.
2716;man does a wonderful job of combining romance, action, comedy, and suspense all in beautifully well crafted script that remains consistent despite a couple integrating story lines.
2717;man was a relative bunch of unknowns but each member works well in their own way in this film outside of this handicap.
2718;But those fears can now be put to rest as the young actor proves that he can express vivid emotions even when his face is hidden behind a mask.
2719;Kirsten Dunst, who had gained some exposure in films like Jumanji and Bring It On, presents the perfect amount of girl next door charm that gives the story its real heart, which can only compliment her acting ability within the film.
2720;And William Dafoe, who takes on the duo role of Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin, shows true acting talent especially in the scene where Norman argues with his alter self in the mirror and in his mind.
2721;man manages to spin a web that is able to capture many integral story elements in an amazingly beautiful pattern that doesn't out do itself.
2722;Though the film manages to pull off great things, there are a couple of things to pick at here and there.
2723;One of the most prominent examples has to be the musical score conducted by Danny Elfman, who also worked on the soundtrack for another superhero film, Batman.
2724;man is a prestigious effort that gives huge compliments to the filmmakers and all other parties involved in finally bringing this comic.
2725;This movie had you rolling in your chairs laughing and on the edge of your seat in suspense!
2726;Toby played an excellent Peter!
2727;So overall I recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see an instant classic!!
2728;top performance was a caricature, not a character).
2729;and, in reflection, that's a good thing, since the spectacle here isn't all that spectacular.
2730;man is perhaps the most emotionally involving comic.
2731;that is in no small part due to Tobey Maguire, who is absolutely perfect as the all.
2732;human Peter Parker, a nerdy young man who is bitten by a super spider and develops superhuman capabilities.
2733;This is, of course, the essential backstory that all comic book characters have, and this one really clicks.
2734;He can be what he wants, and he wants to be a super.
2735;hero, but more importantly, he chooses to be a super.
2736;there's real humanity and pathos in that decision, and Maguire's performance really brings that out.
2737;Osborne's son Harry (James Franco) is Parker's best friend, and even after Spider.
2738;All the rest, including Nicholson's Joker, are just cartoon characters .
2739;this all makes for a good basic drama, built on nice dialogue and fine performances .
2740;a rarity in films of this sort, which almost invariably succeed as spectacle and fail miserably as drama.
2741;man takes to the air, and the CGI effects cross the screen, it plays like a video game .
2742;Many recent films, notably the latest Star Wars prequel, have shown that CGI can create animation that has real weight, realism and elegance.
2743;As it is, I'm sure that the immense success of this film will enable the producers to hire a more competent visual effects shop for the upcoming sequel.
2744;man, then that movie will truly be something to see.
2745;Spiderman (2002)This year's summer blockbusters are actually looking pretty ship.
2746;Last year we had the disappointments of such films as Rush Hour 2, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and so on and so forth, but to make up for those, in 2002 we've got Spiderman, Star Wars: Episode II and heaps of other intriguing films being released.
2747;Not only do I think this will be one of the best summer blockbusters of this year, I think it could turn out to be one of the most entertaining movies of 2002.
2748;Sure, the movie is cheesy in some places, but duh
2749;this movie keeps you in suspense (especially during the fair sequence) and surprised me with its genuine wit and heart.
2750;The movie brings across some very important messages that not only superheroes should learn.
2751;I also liked it the way the movie built up Peter Parker becoming Spiderman because it put a bit of bulk on his character.
2752;the acting in Spiderman was terrific.
2753;In my opinion, all the actors were perfectly cast.
2754;Tobey Maguire is not the sort of guy you'd expect to play a superhero but he pulls it off stunningly, making a great hero and also turning Peter Parker into a likeable and memorable teen.
2755;He has a great, evil laugh and his character (when he's not the Goblin) is sort of like a schizophrenic.
2756;The scenes where Dafoe is talking to himself are terrific and very well acted.
2757;Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary Jane, providing her with a heart and personality.
2758;Dunst has exactly the right look for the movie, and has some fantastic chemistry with Maguire.
2759;I also adored Rosemary Harris in her role as Peter Parker's auntie.
2760;the special effects in this movie are terrific.
2761;I can't really pick out any key scenes where they were brilliant because I just completely forgot I was watching special effects.
2762;We pretty much got the sticky web thing and that was it.
2763;I look forward to seeing how Spidey's super.
2764;powers are improved in the next movie.
2765;spiderman is a movie I think everyone will enjoy.
2766;It has a big heart and it is always entertaining to watch.
2767;It has terrific morals and messages and is able to mix genuine wit and comedy into an action.
2768;This movie was a lot of fun and I think it'll be one of the biggest grossing movies of 2002, if not, the biggest!
2769;man first off, is a great movie.
2770;It's really what a fun movie is all about and it doesn't feel like the 121 minutes it is.
2771;The first disc, actually has more of the fun extra.
2772;One that's okay (the sam raimi one) but a really good one (visual FX Crew).
2773;The second disc is mostly promotional stuff except for the great documentary about the Spider.
2774;i can say this: It IS a fun movie.
2775;It has some pretty cool special effects and I like the characters for the most part.
2776;Tobey McGwire does a very good job portraying the unlikely hero.
2777;I also liked Kirsten Dunst, but that goes without saying.
2778;This movie is a strange case where I found the plot and character moments much more satisfying and believable than the actual action.
2779;I am a big superhero fan.
2780;With his new powers, he has the added burden to carry.
2781;Here he is with all these wonderful powers, and he gets nothing from them but grief
2782;The sheer craft of this movie is, of course, incredible
2783;But it is the casting which is this movie's ultimate triumph.
2784;model handsome, which Maguire most definitely is not.
2785;But Maguire is such a pure, emotionally direct actor that he makes you love Peter and ache for him.
2786;Kirsten Dunst, perhaps the most talented actress of her generation, is equally lovable as MJ.
2787;Willem Dafoe does a brilliant job of playing the Jekyll.
2788;hyde aspects of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin
2789;This unquestionably is the best superhero movie ever made.
2790;The year's supposed Blockbuster hit Spider.
2791;i personally loved movies based on comic characters and honestly, seeing Spider.
2792;tobey Maguire was a perfect fit for the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman.
2793;Maybe if Ms. Dunst tried not to TRY so hard at acting, maybe then she'll be a formidable lady to portray Mary.
2794;It's good, but I've seen better.
2795;Don't get me wrong
2796;seat awe of what was being shown in the big screen.
2797;i'm sure you'll enjoy this movie.
2798;but for those seeking theatrical works and amazing ingenuity.
2799;This is a really good movie, even if you weren't a Spider.
2800;The movie itself has a really good plot line and really good actors, and the special effects at least seem real.
2801;The extras are packed, and they really enhance the film.
2802;a surprise is this film is actually quite complex when it comes to human emotions and motivations.
2803;man each person has their own set of complexity.
2804;The acting is excellent, particularly the scenes between Maguire and Dunst.
2805;There is humor, and in a display of skill this humor grows naturally out of the situations, and does not feel forced.
2806;the action sequences are dynamic .
2807;swinging across New York City at great speed.
2808;They must be delighted in seeing Maguire (who did at least some of his own stunts) bring Spidey's speed and agility to the screen.
2809;man 2 and 3 are already in the works, we may well look back on the 'slow' scenes as a good place to catch one's breath.
2810;Other than that mask, this is a film that rocks hard and fast any time someone in costume is on screen, and seethes with intrigue when the characters are in mufti.
2811;Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter Parker, a ordinary teenage boy who only dreams of winning the heart and admiration of the lovely Mary Jane Watson (Who is wonderfully portrayed by Kristen Dunst), his next.
2812;and gives our protagonist the ability of a spider!
2813;It is enjoyable when we watch Peter discover and develop his special abilities.
2814;is killed, Peter learns that with great power, comes great responsibility and promised himself to fight crime as the amazing Spider.
2815;The movie is entertaining to watch because the storyline is well written.
2816;it is original, creative, and they don't tend to copy from anything.
2817;i loved the special effects.
2818;The action scenes were awesome, but what I liked most about the movie.
2819;My son loves this movie.
2820;We got this to replace the vhs and I know this will be well loved.
2821;Great price and fast shipping.
2822;As a kid, I read the SPIDERMAN comic books and, I'm glad to say that the movie followed the thrust of the comics quite well.
2823;all of these themes and hard points are also covered in the film, which makes it great for comic book fans.
2824;In addition, to make it marketable we've got all the usual CGI effects, as well as some cool scenes and a popular cast (i. e. Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe).
2825;sPIDERMAN was suppossedly the highest grossing film for 2002.
2826;Sam Raimis Spiderman is a classic film ushered in a new age of superhero movies.
2827;This film (unlike the reboot) stays true to the spirit of the comics and the character (for the most part).
2828;It has great action and heart, and most importantly, is wonderfully entertaining.
2829;The first thirty minutes covers the origin story which everyone knows.
2830;The film stayed true to the comics for the most part from the origin to the rest of the film.
2831;They captured Peter Parkers life well.
2832;He struggles to hold a job, he has a hard time keeping his promises, and he struggles between his normal life and his life as Spiderman.
2833;I also like the look of the film.
2834;The score also reminded me of Batman with it being composed by Danny Elfman.
2835;With the exception of a few things which I will cover later I think this film captures the spirit of Spiderman well.
2836;the cast was, for the most part, very good.
2837;Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were the perfect choices for Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
2838;the action scenes are also very well.
2839;Say what you want, but I think the action scenes in this film are far superior to the ones in Amazing Spiderman.
2840;The effects are also well.
2841;done for the most part.
2842;I think the effects in this are just as good as most of the effects in Amazing Spiderman which is, honestly, pretty sad.
2843;As much as I hate to admit it there is one thing that Amazing Spiderman has over this film and the other Raimi films is Spidermans love interest.
2844;Gwen is Stacey beats Mary Jane hands down at least as in terms of the movies.
2845;She is like Lois Lane from the early days of Superman.
2846;She actually has a character.
2847;Is that the best you could do?
2848;Tobey McGuire plays a great Peter Parker.
2849;McGuire does great playing Peter, but not the best Spiderman.
2850;The costume looks awesome and he looks great in the costume.
2851;Spiderman, even in the early days was witty when he had the costume on and was fighting bad guys, because that is how he coped with his situation.
2852;He is very fun, intimidating (without the costume), and Dafoe brings a lot of energy to the role.
2853;At first he wants to kill the Oscorp board members but he accomplishes that very early on.
2854;overall, Spiderman is still a classic superhero film despite the reboot.
2855;I still like this film and will gladly take it over Amazing Spiderman any day.
2856;It is definitely not perfect, but it captures the spirit of Spiderman more than that film ever did.
2857;teen and remember it like it was yesterday!
2858;I recommend to anyone any age
2859;I'm a comics fan from WAY back.
2860;I just saw it again on Christmas Eve, and again, pure bliss.
2861;The characters are terrific, the effects nifty and the drama multilayered and involving at all times.
2862;honestly, I couldn't ask for more.
2863;But with this movie they got it right.
2864;They chose a director with a energetic, comic book style in Sam Raimi and the right actors.
2865;Also a near perfect choice to star in the movie was Toby Macguire.
2866;But before we see them fight on the rooftops of New York, we get to know the characters, who they are, and why they are important to the story.
2867;then when the action starts, it is eye filling, but not always perfect.
2868;Spiderman swinging from building to building on his web is the best effect, along with his battle to save Mary Jane and a lift full of children on one of Manhattans' bridges.
2869;but overall, this a movie tht is sure to please you.
2870;The core of the film is rock solid, even if the some of the trappings are a little frayed.
2871;Spiderman does the classic comic book hero justice, and they are many movies that can say they did that, and did it well.
2872;This is one of the best movies made with a comic book character in them.
2873;I always enjoy watching this movie because its fun to watch and its has cool special effects.
2874;Overall this movie is great with tons of special features.
2875;The balloon sequence (Macy's Thanksgiving day parade).
2876;This film is a simple delight.
2877;The scenes of Spidey webswinging over NYC are a literal delight to watch.
2878;Maguire delivers a cute, believable and loveable Peter Parker, but Willem Dafoe almost steals the movie as the Green Goblin.
2879;When was the last time being bad looked so good.
2880;whenever Sam Raimi's involved, you can expect the blood and spit to fly
2881;Highly recommended, with the possible exception of very young children.
2882;This was a good super hero flick.
2883;It was more than just special effects and violence and gets you interested in the story as well.
2884;it has all the interesting extras you are looking for.
2885;on the upside, there's some nice action in this film.
2886;And that's saying something in a comic book universe.
2887;I'm not here to belittle the new Amazing version.
2888;Then I started thinking of remakes of Let The Right One In and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and all version are very good.
2889;Becoming ill, Peter awakens the next day with perfect eyesight, tossing his previously needed glasses.
2890;He also discovers microscopic barbs on his hands which allow him great gripping power.
2891;You might not remember this but Maguire is also quite toned and fit for this role.
2892;As in Amazing some of the better scenes involve Parker's adaptation to the flying ability.
2893;Maguire and Dunst have great chemistry and it comes out in their moments together, irrespective of Maguire being Parker or Spidey at the time.
2894;Dafoe teams up once again with the great British actress, Rosemary Harris, who he worked with in 1994's Tom and Viv.
2895;Here Harris is Peter's aunt and she adds some real class to the film.
2896;man 2 is truly heartfelt, providing the moral compass to young Parker.
2897;j. K. Simmons (Juno) is on hand to add some comic relief as the newspaper editor.
2898;Also watch for Oscar winner Octavia Spencer (The Help) as a clerk at the wrestling match Peter enters to win some money.
2899;The bottom line is that I liked this original Spider.
2900;Although it shows a bit of grain it is consistent with the original film.
2901;The colors are good and the blacks are black.
2902;Overall it does look improved.
2903;This movie was so exciting!
2904;The special effects were wonderful.
2905;watching it on surround sound was a great experience.
2906;I highly recommend this movie to all Spiderman fans and to those who haven't given it a try yet.
2907;He definitely did the character justice!!
2908;This will always be one of my favorite movies!
2909;It is about time Marvel stepped up to the plate with a big time superhero film.
2910;DC had Superman and Batman with tons of success and sequels.
2911;This millenium belongs to Marvel.
2912;I was also eager to hear rumors about another great comic character, Hellboy.
2913;A Hellboy film is in the making.
2914;Toby was great for the role of Peter Parker, thus making him better for Spiderman.
2915;Everyone enjoys watching an average Joe accomplish greatness.
2916;His urge to triumph over the school bully, his desire for the girl he loves, these are elements important to every coming.
2917;These are components in making a great hero movie.
2918;This is a movie to watch again and again.
2919;I give it five out of five stars.
2920;I guess I was just out of the mix, because Maguire did a great job, and the movie is more than I ever thought it could be.
2921;paced and riveting, and Danny Elfman's musical score is rich and powerful.
2922;man is so great:Remember how it was easier to be entertained as a kid?
2923;See, what the power Rangers did for me then, Spider.
2924;and, hidden beneath all the wondrous action and comic book drama (which is by no means a bad thing), there's a message from the hero: With great power, comes great responsibility.
2925;This is the first time in my life that I am willing to say that I have watched a real comic book movie.
2926;It really succeeds in capturing the spirit of the comics.
2927;Spiderman treads the fine line, it never goes to far into cheese, but is proud enough of it's comic book origins to show them.
2928;It also keeps dialogue that you could have seen in the comics.
2929;The film has strong characters, good acting and some breathtaking action sequences, filled with amazing effects.
2930;A high school geek named Peter Parker is on a school trip to see some spiders.
2931;i would like to point out that the character development in this film is not as high as it was in X. men, but this works in it's favour.
2932;You see it's all in the spirit of a comic book movie.
2933;The reason that a comic has such strong characters is because they are developed over years.
2934;Each story will develop another aspect of the characters personality and then focus on the action.
2935;the majority of actors in this film are first class.
2936;Toby Maguire in the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman is brilliant, managing to convincingly convey both the geek and the hero.
2937;He is just over the top enough to be a comic book villain, but still knows that he doesn't need to resort to cheese for the role.
2938;As for Kirsten Dunts as Mary Jane, she's perfect.
2939;She was the love interest, and for her personality I'd like to add.
2940;The scene in the rain has nothing to do with it, honest.
2941;finally the most important part, the action.
2942;The effects are simply amazing.
2943;The fights with the, green Goblin are all amazing though.
2944;When I review a film I concider a classic I like to be optimistic and focus on the good.
2945;This time though the film is basically perfect.
2946;Yes Jonah may be over the top, and some of the FX a little unrealistic, but a 100% perfect film will never happen.
2947;The effects, the acting, the directing and the music were marvelously interwoven.
2948;This was a marvelous film, one that the creators of Spidey can be proud of.
2949;Personally I loved the NBC TV show and can't remember the guy who played Spidey, but I have always been in love with the Spiderman character.
2950;It's a perfectly wholesome film to get hooked into and I don't care if it was a little smarmy in spots.
2951;It's a delightful film from the word go and I look forward to more.
2952;man, which grossed nearly 600 million worldwide, is a fantastic roller coaster ride.
2953;The directing and fight scenes are amazing, the villains and story are gripping, and the whole thing is a classic.
2954;Now, you can own 2002's greatest hit.
2955;blockuster has been set for 2004 and just in case you missed the first, now you have a chance to not only see but own a sensational, entertaining, and fantastic hit!
2956;Tobey Maguire does a fine job as Peter Parker, the dorky high.
2957;slinging, climbing, and having a spider.
2958;The movie features many great action sequences with some great special effects and a good cast featuring Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, the man who turns into the sadistic Green Goblin.
2959;man is the best movie of 2002.
2960;Kirsten Dunst is amazing in her role as Mary Jane Watson, Peter's beautiful classmate.
2961;James Franco is great playing Harry Osborn, Peter's best friend.
2962;And Willem Dafoe is good playing Norman Osborn, Harry's dad.
2963;The extras are superb including the HBO Making of Spider.
2964;in the words of uncle ben, with great power, comes great responsability .
2965;man treads a lot of fine lines, as all superhero movies must, and it negotiates all of them reasonably well, until the big action scene at the end.
2966;I liked this movie when it first came out in theaters and my kids love it now.
2967;Raimi has done an excellent job and clearly is/was comic book reader/fan and has done a very good job and stayed mostly faithful to the Spiderman comic book readers know and love.
2968;My only quibble, and this applies to the superhero movie genre as a whole (not necessarily this particular movie), is that the movie gives varying levels of ability or strength to fit the story line.
2969;It gives a weird disconnect to have Spiderman struggles with something that should be well within his capability in some situations but is able to perform extraordinary feats easily in others.
2970;Spidey should be able to lift up a bus but struggles to hold on to a car.
2971;I never was into the comics and spiderman with all those characters so I really didn't want to see it, but everyone said it was good and it was getting amazing reviews, I had nothing to lose except $[money], I came out of the theatre in disbelief and instantly I was attached, I wanted to know more about a sequal.
2972;i'm sure we will love this when we recieve it.
2973;Well, I saw Spiderman on opening day and I thought it was good.
2974;He's unlike all these other famous superheroes.
2975;But lets talk about the film.
2976;Tobey Maguire played Peter Parker great.
2977;I really thought his performance was very strong.
2978;See, Tobey has this sort of wimper in his voice that's great for Peter Parker, but you still can hear it at times when he's Spidey, and that doesn't sit well with me.
2979;Spiderman is a superhero with a sense of humor.
2980;While he's fighting bad guys he uses lots of funny one liners, and I'm not talking campy now.
2981;I loved it in fact.
2982;The origin of Spidey was done well.
2983;In fact it was one of my favorite parts of the movie.
2984;In the film, Peter, now with his newfound powers, wants to impress Mary Jane (MJ) by getting a car.
2985;In the comic he receives the full amount of prize money.
2986;the disclusion of Peter's first real girlfriend, Gwen Stacy.
2987;And they did get this right in the film, so that was good.
2988;Like I said, it was a good film, but not great.
2989;But I guess this is the perfect example of what you get when you condense a comic book into movie form.
2990;Oh yeah, and Willem Defoe was quite good as Norman Osbourne.
2991;Spidey's costume was very impressive.
2992;I also enjoyed the cameos by Bruce (Evil Dead) Campbell as the wrestling announcer and Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as one of the workers at the Daily Bugle.
2993;The nice treat for me was towards the very end of the credits the actual Spiderman theme song from the 60's animated series was played.
2994;So go see the film and have a good time.
2995;It's not perfect, as comic book fans like myself will atest.
2996;but it's a lot of fun!
2997;though I am a Superman fan, by putting down this Spiderman movie your probably thinking I am comparing well ok Superman 2 is a classic that will always remain top of the pile.
2998;hollywood its back to the drawing board.
2999;This was a great movie as you probaly know.
3000;The end fight was pretty cool to.
3001;I give this one 5 stars because this was a great movie.
3002;i gave this as a gift and since then i have seen it my self.
3003;very nice and complete gift set here.
3004;This movie is truly a dream come true for a long time Spider.
3005;But, here we are, and here we have a movie that actually succeeds in rising above the rest.
3006;Sam Rami did what a true fan would do .
3007;stayed true to the source material .
3008;while maintaining the objectivity and realistic approach of a film.
3009;But, while cinema demands certain structural devices for reasons of plot and pace, he has captured the essence of Spider.
3010;For Spiderfans in know this movie project was something a good 10 to 20 years in the making and I'd dare say, Spider.
3011;Featuring a solid storyline, AWESOME action sequences, CGI and regular special effects this movie, which stayed fairly true to Spider.
3012;man's greatest foe bent on destroying our favorite superhero by any means (including some PERSONAL, close to home attacks) necessary.
3013;The first and subsequent fight scenes between Spidey and the Green Goblin are what make this movie a winner.
3014;The action choreography and accurate depiction of both men's fighting styles stay true to the book, including Spider.
3015;The fight scenes between both men (especially the first one) are among the best you will ever see in ANY action movie.2.
3016;Definitely ranking up their in any Hollywood production are how Spider.
3017;slinging powers are rendered in this film.
3018;Again, very true to his comic.
3019;book depiction you'll marvel at how Spider.
3020;Obviously looking towards future sequels and building a franchise it's a great treat for long.
3021;man and the budding relationship of Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker at the end.
3022;The movie features a robber/carjacker.
3023;The comic has a robber/burglar.3.
3024;The movie revolves around eventual Spider.
3025;man resident female love interest, Mary Jane Watson(.
3026;The action, effects and story are solid with enough hanging plot threads that will make long.
3027;while some of the changes between comic and movie may have hardcore fans a little uppity, the changes are minor enough to let by and the rest of the movie's great points should put aside any other worries.
3028;Perfectly cast, great adaption to the comic book with many scenes visually right out of the classic comic pages.
3029;defoe played the part perfectly!
3030;This is a popcorn movie all the way and Spider.
3031;man 2 was even better.
3032;hero movie type but I love the Superman movies ( at least 1 and 2 ) and I also had an interest in Spiderman so I gave this film a shot.
3033;Willem Dafoe is solid as the Goblin and the rest of the cast does their parts pretty well.
3034;i did enjoy the story development and the characters did progress enough to keep it interesting.
3035;Overall, this is well acted, well executed, and keeps you interested which is pretty good for Comic Book movies that usually are awful ( Hulk, Batman ).
3036;Spiderman was one of the most eagerly awaited movies of 2002, which is a lot of baggage to carry when setting out to make an adaptation of one of the most popular comic strips ever.
3037;fire winner and indeed it is exactly that.
3038;He's as pure as the driven snow, devoted to his Aunt and Uncle, the boy for girls to take home to their mother, safe, kind but somewhat unexciting.
3039;First off, what I found most impressive and refreshing was the screenplay, which unlike most major Hollywood studio major event movies actually relies on narrative, plot and character development to tell the story instead of just loosely sewing together action scenes with meaningless dialogue (Simon West are you listening?)
3040;footed and subtle and the decision to give him megaphone duties has proven to be well vindicated.
3041;The casting of Tobey Maguire is another masterstroke because Tobey Maguire is undoubtedly one of the most talented young actors around with a CV of critically acclaimed performances in critically acclaimed movies, that seasoned veterans would be proud of, such as
3042;Kirsten Dunst (Drop Dead Gorgeous, The Virgin Suicides) is also a spectacular success with her girl next.
3043;For example, some of the web.
3044;Plus the final scenes where a crowd of New Yorkers hurl objects at the Green Goblin has a definite tagged on feel to it but the who can blame them for it's addition is entirely appropriate and rightly captures the spirit of NYC in the aftermath of 9/11: Ya take one of us on, ya take us all on!
3045;man is a resounding success and with Raimi, Maguire and Dunst all signed up for the sequel, I personally cant wait for Spider.
3046;I think this movie is just great!
3047;A lot of action and a great story line and what I just love about this movie is that there is no sex or foul langauage.
3048;Good for kids to see and great classic movie!
3049;Highly recommended not just for kids, but for adults as well.
3050;It is also a romantic in a sense with the girl he thought he could never have but has always wanted and how that relationship goes.
3051;it's because what's worth talking about in a review of the SPIDER.
3052;mAN movie is the fact that the characters as well as the comic itself have been done justice.
3053;mAN is one of the most iconic, beloved, and enduring creations in comics, and in many ways, embodies all of the most essential qualities of a superhero.
3054;mAN, it' pretty clear that the web.
3055;kids will enjoy it for its sophomoric action.
3056;I am still blown away with how great this movie was with it's action, and drama.
3057;M. j.'s and his relationship growing up.
3058;They can be easily overlooked for the fact that this movie is #1 and still rising.
3059;I have great expectataion for Spider.
3060;But overall, it is still consider a nice show.
3061;This is the Best Comic Book movie since the first Batman.
3062;I was so excited to see Spiderman, having visited many of the web sites that cater to the upcoming film lovers.
3063;wonderful adaptation of the comic.
3064;Well worth your time if you enjoy super heroes and their stories of how they developed their powers as super heroes.
3065;this carries the true spirit of Spider.
3066;this story is a conventional love story.
3067;As the opening voiceover says, like all good stories, it's about a girl.
3068;things seem to be going well for Peter .
3069;he impresses Mary Jane, he beats up her bullying boyfriend .
3070;the sequences of Spiderman demonstrating his skills are by far the best.
3071;The battle sequences with the Green Goblin are exciting, particularly against the backdrop of the re.
3072;J. k. Simmons as Jonah Jameson, the Daily Bugle editor who gives Parker his first job as a photographer, was great (particularly when compared to his role as a neo.
3073;And Kirsten Dunst looked cute as the gal.
3074;book style adaptation on film.
3075;He then finds that his physical body has been enhanced, and eventually, he becomes half spider.
3076;He harnesses the ability to climb walls and skyscrapers, and leap far distances.
3077;He also finds he is able to shoot extremely strong web strings.
3078;Meanwhile, the media going wild with news stories of strange appearances Spider.
3079;The climax features a big showdown between Spider.
3080;The film ends with a somewhat bittersweet ending.
3081;The ending makes it obvious that the doors are wide open for a Spider.
3082;man wasn't a movie that met expectations exactly, it's still worth seeing.
3083;If you enjoyed B. type movies like Lost in Space, Independance Day, Godzilla etc, you will enjoy Spider.
3084;sure the goblin could have been better but this is still the best comic movie EVER.
3085;Movie stays true to the Spiderman legend.
3086;defoe is a great Green Goblin.
3087;The first route is the movie will be utterly disappointing and lacking any of the intensity from the book it is adapted from (see the Spawn live action film for example), while the second route is a riveting, very well put together film that carries the essence of the comic (the original Superman and Batman and the Blade series).
3088;man isn't the best comic adaption to film, but this long awaited movie more than delivers the goods.
3089;Tobey Maguire is rather good and believeable as Peter Parker and Spider.
3090;man and seems to be a great choice for the role in the future films, while Kirsten Dunst is as stunning as ever as Mary Jane Watson.
3091;James Franco perfectly captures the personality and insecurity of Harry Osborne, while Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are very good as well as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
3092;But the best casting and performance goes to Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne, he is absolutely perfect as the maniacal schizo and is clearly having a lot of fun in his role, while an almost as perfect performance by J. k. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who is perfectly cast and looks just like the character does in the comic.
3093;Director Sam Raimi (director of the cult classics Evil Dead Trilogy and the original Darkman) directs with his usual stylish flair (along with some shameless corporate promotions) and is a great example of how to make a comic adapted film with a director who knows the comic.
3094;man may not be up there with the original Superman, Batman, and Blade, but it is more than worth a look.
3095;The movies Shrek, Superman and The Fifth Element are among my favorites because of the animation and special effects.
3096;Based on the reviews of the critics and other viewers I anticipated that Spider.
3097;man would excel in some of the same attributes as these movies such as interesting and engaging storyline and good acting as well as first rate special effect and animation.
3098;I hope you find this, along with the positive reviews, helpful in drawing your own conclusions.
3099;Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be.
3100;I'll stick to talking about part 1 here.
3101;**Great job adapting the comic to the big screen.
3102;They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one.
3103;This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.
3104;**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here.
3105;All of their scenes feel so genuine.
3106;with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation.
3107;Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the oh hey!!!
3108;parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight.
3109;Regardless of The Dark cloud which is part 3 hanging over this franchise, these first two installments are the best superhero movies made in terms of pure enjoyment.
3110;I thought the cast was great.
3111;Everyone was good in it.
3112;William Dafoe was over the top, but fun as The Green Goblin.
3113;Visual effects were top notch, even though sometimes they look fake, but it gives it the comic book feel.
3114;will love great story really cool fx,s this is in my mind the #1 super hero movie to date .
3115;im a huge spidey fan and the fans were very scared about how this movie whould be made .
3116;Tobey Maguire (The Cider House Rules), one of the finest young actors today, is.
3117;I have seen this film twice at the theater and I can't get enough of it!
3118;man is smart, funny, and action.
3119;packed all the way from start to finish!
3120;The director of this film, Sam Raimi (Darkman), did not just a great job, but an outstanding job in bringing this Marvel comic book adaption to life on the big screen!
3121;I am sure that everyone knows the story of Spider.
3122;And before you know it, Peter Parker is now the amazing Spider.
3123;During the movie, Peter learns an invaluable lesson from his uncle Ben: With great power, comes great responsibility.
3124;And the movie goes on from there with lots of explosive action and then some!
3125;man, and that I have to give a lot of credit to Tobey Maguire for his physical abilities and his unique sense of acting that brought him to the role of a lifetime.
3126;I also have to give a lot of credit to Willem Dafoe for his role of the Green Goblin.
3127;Dafoe is at his villainous best since Ian McKellen's Magneto in 2000's X. men!
3128;And the credit also goes to Kirsten Dunst for her very sweet performance as Mary Jane, and to Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peter's guardians throughout the years.
3129;art special effects, a great soundtrack, ground.
3130;pounding action and suspense, laugh.
3131;loud humor, lots of emotion, a top.
3132;man is, to me, 20 times better than what X. men gave you 2 years ago!
3133;This is not just the best film of 2002, this is the greatest blockbuster of 2002!
3134;man is a really good movie if you ask me.
3135;He's pretty dorky as Peter Parker, but that makes him seem even more unlikely to be a super hero, which makes it so great.
3136;But once it gets going, it's a really good movie.
3137;I was shocked by how good this movie is.
3138;The special effects are great.
3139;It looks so real, the movements of his body and the way his muscles move.
3140;Don't get me wrong
3141;But, still, he looks really good when he's flying with his glider.
3142;Think Mortal Kombat meets Rocky.
3143;And Kirstin Dunst did a really good job playing Mary Jane, too.
3144;disc Deluxe Edition) has everything and more that you want to know about this great movie, bargain for what you get.
3145;But when I saw it, I realized that it's a very good movie.
3146;The story is about Peter Parker, a normal teenager who's in love with the High School's sweetheart, Mary.
3147;He uses his powers to avenge his Uncle Ben and to fight the Green Goblin.
3148;The movie is very good because of the script that holds perfectly throughout the movie and the performances of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe are excellent.
3149;The special effects are very elaborate and are in fact the best in years.
3150;mAN is the best superhero movie since 1989's BATMAN, which is also very good.
3151;mAN is also the best movie of 2002 by far, since that STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES kinda sucked.
3152;It's the Best comic book movie ever made!
3153;The Plot revolves around these characters and how they came to be!
3154;This is a very well written story with great dialogue and well written script.
3155;Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) are fantastic together!
3156;They have a wonderful chemistry in the film.
3157;This movie is a wonderful translation from the comic book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko to the silver screen!
3158;man is a movie which may actually appeal more to casual fans of Spider.
3159;While writing this review I thought of casual and hardcore fans, though I did not think of non.
3160;Toby Maguire is excellent as Peter Parker, and is very convincing as a young man coming to terms with his superpowers.
3161;Kirsten Dunst is also quite good in her role as Mary Jane, while Willem Dafoe is quite a good Norm Osborn.
3162;However the best acting performance came from J. k. Simmons as J. Joanah Jameson, who is quite hilarious in his performance.
3163;the script is also well written
3164;It is amazingly touching and its characters feel surprisingly human.
3165;man knows that Spidey is full of one.
3166;i must admit to the fact that the special affects are fantastic.
3167;man looks fantastic swinging past fast moving vehicles, and doing Matrix like moves.
3168;The scenes where he utilizes his abilities, are especially well done.
3169;man movie is a visual feat, and its unmasked characters are extremely well developed.
3170;What those movies had though, was a great soundtrack, which the Spider.
3171;Also, those movies' superheroes had a lot of heart when they were in their costumes, while Spider.
3172;Like Batman, Superman, and The X. men movies, Spider.
3173;man does a good job when it comes to the character development of its unmasked hero.
3174;In fact I'd take it a step further, and say that Peter Parker is as well developed as Clark Kent was.
3175;man, and had not yet developed his Spider.
3176;man movie is quite good.
3177;It features some good character development, some superb action, witty dialogue (from everyone except for the webslinger), and great direction.
3178;This movie will do for superhero fans, what the original Superman movies did.
3179;Well scripted, acted, and clean.
3180;When I was a kid, I was a regular viewer of the Spiderman cartoons on TV.
3181;my favorite comic book hero has hit the big screen.
3182;now, I'm not normally a big fan of comic book movies, and in fact this one (and its sequel) are the only ones I have watched.
3183;They have definitely succeeded on the latter count!I think this movie is a wonderfully entertaining adaptation of the comic books and cartoons I loved as a 12 year old boy.
3184;Sure, the serious afficionado can find some details to quibble over, but overall I was very impressed with the way the Spiderman legend was brought vividly to life.
3185;I especially enjoyed the way the actors were made to look just like their comic book counterparts.
3186;This was intended to be pure fun and fantasy, and it was definitely that.
3187;It's a wild ride from the beginning to end.
3188;sum41 and saliva are cool .
3189;this is film making at its finest.you have a great cast great effects and most importantly a great story.
3190;I remember when this movie first came out I was somewhat skeptical about seeing it but I finally gave in and was surprised of how good it was and how faithful it was to the comic book.
3191;this movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie.
3192;Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider.
3193;man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J. k. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately.
3194;The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily.
3195;Alfred Molina is fantastic as Doc Oc and the storyline follows the comic pretty well for a movie version of a comic.
3196;The special effects are as expected, wonderful.
3197;Spiderman is here stronger than ever!!
3198;This movie is a really good transfer of a lot of children's childhood hero to the cinema and that is shown by the box.
3199;Director has picked really good parts of Spiderman's story to include in the motion picture and i think that the choice of the specific actors was really wise.
3200;Generally a movie that is worth having!
3201;Spiey can throw web and disarm all of you!
3202;He is the greatest super.
3203;Bravo to the producers who decided to make such a good investment!
3204;Bravo to the actors and especially to Willem Dafoe who took part in this film!
3205;Well done to everyone in the cast and crew!
3206;Maguire does an excellent job playing Peter Parker, as did Dunst, who played Mary Jane MJ Watson.
3207;Excellent cinematography and special effects!!!
3208;man, my jaw dropped at the incredible graphics, acting, story, and emotion put into this comic book brought to life movie.
3209;After viewing everything, here's what I thought:First off, the movie: I loved this movie, and is one of the top 3 of my favorites ever!
3210;The story goes a lot with the old comic books.
3211;The spider gives him super.
3212;He uses his abilities (web sling, incredible strength, and super.
3213;The whole movie is basicly these two fighting.
3214;man's true identity and.you'll have to see.
3215;what made this movie so great was A.
3216;man and wonderful acting all around and B. Perhaps the best graphics ever seen in a movie.
3217;Everything seems so real that you can't really tell it's special affects.
3218;The city landscacpes and swinging is just incredible.
3219;Explosions, realism, web, destruction, everything makes this movie so real and exciting.
3220;so if u like a good romance, lots of action, incredible graphics, and a ton of fighting (with a little humor) Spider.
3221;This was a great movie, with a great ending that sets up for.
3222;The making of the movie, messups, a free demo of the PC game of Spider.
3223;man, staff thoughts, and a lot lot more.
3224;For the movie, the extras, and because of just how good it is.
3225;man: The Movie
3226;i hope this helped, and I know that I love and can't get enough of Spider.
3227;I loved this movie .
3228;they've done a great job of bringing the comicsonto the screen while also modernising it a bit.
3229;I also liked the waythey highlighted the importance of Mary Jane by making it 'her story'in a way.
3230;found gifts and learning how best to utilize them.
3231;toby Maguire turns in a winning performance as Peter Parker/ Spiderman,which should really turn him into a big, big star.
3232;Kirsten Dunst isattractive in a warm kind of way rather than ravishingly pretty.
3233;WillemDafoe proves yet again that he's capable of fine villanious performances.
3234;the other support actors are good, too.
3235;a special word for Sam Raimi, who's done an exceedingly good job ofadapting a popular superhero series for the silver screen, a feat notso easily achieved.
3236;the special effects, sets etc are all quite good and add to the impact.
3237;i'll definitely watch the sequel !!
3238;The best thing about Spider.
3239;Here they have managed to pick up a fan boy director who is committed to translating a comic book hero onto the screen.
3240;Not only that but he is also translating a whole comic book onto the screen.
3241;man, should feel very happy with the final result.
3242;man (Great casting and played to form by Tobey Maguire although I think Jason Patrick would make a good older version of Spider.
3243;comings of adulthood, love and geekness.
3244;Much of it matches with the reality we live in and it is all played out very realistically and at times with lots of humour.
3245;man turns dark, and it does turn dark, it is very twisted, emotionally challenging and does swing between that fine line of lynch mob revenge and real justice.
3246;the premise is simple but complex in the execution.
3247;Kid gets bit by radioactive spider, transforms into superhero, meets an anti.
3248;This makes for an emotionally charged ending when all is finally unmasked.
3249;that this genre can offer with ample amounts of family values and teenage dilemmas.
3250;There is even a final shot of a half.
3251;man where Parker is a reflection of his torn self proving that this character carries lots of psychological fun to boot.
3252;this actually has a way more depth that you would expect and to its credit the character department is expertly handled.
3253;**As a note the action in the film transcends its PG.13 rating.
3254;man is the best superhero movie of the past 20 years.
3255;it's closest relative in the success of translating both the immense scale and intimate characterizations of the character is 1978's Superman.
3256;I thought Tobey Maguire was a good choice to play Spider.
3257;x. men was a good comic.
3258;man takes the advantage of a solitary origin and allows us to see the character evolve with time .
3259;stunningly faithful to the source material but moving at a good on.
3260;When Peter is bitten by the spider and receives his powers, you jump with him roof to roof, laugh as he tries out his new abilities and marvel as his motions loosen up and become like the human spider who's existed in our minds and in two dimensions for these many years.
3261;The credo of With great power comes great responsibility is translated by Maguire into the Friendy neighborhood Spider.
3262;screen credit as well, Spider.
3263;willem Dafoe does a good job as industrialist Norman Osborn who makes the transition to the maniacal Green Goblin.
3264;The scenes where he struggles with his madness are both funny and sad, while the explanations for his appearance are actually made more logical within the context of the film than in the comics .
3265;The scenes with Peter and his Aunt are nicely done as well, rooting the fantastic world of Spider.
3266;man with the very real world of Peter Parker.
3267;J. k. Simmons is brilliant as newspaper magnate J. Jonah Jameson, perfecting the art of cigar chomping bluster .
3268;James Franco did well as the neglected Harry Osborn, making a unique dynamic in which his best friend and his father are both superpowered beings on flip sides of the coin who must sit down to dinner together.
3269;kirsten Dunst is superb as the sexy, yet damaged Mary Jane who is part of the fabric that makes Peter Parker/Spider.
3270;Her performance is subtle, but the scenes with her and Tobey Maguire are well done.
3271;man does its source material proud, and is a film that can be enjoyed by both diehard fanboys and the general public.
3272;man and Superman are the benchmarks for excellence in comic filmmaking, proving that you can take these Amazing and Sensational characters of two dimensions and faithfully create an entertaining and engaging film without dumbing it down.
3273;This film did a great job of laying the groundwork for things to come.
3274;The casting was great in this film from Spiderman/Peter Parker to his Aunt and Uncle to the high school bullies.
3275;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
3276;You will definitely want to watch this more than once.
3277;Well, I helped contribute to the millions this film is making by seeing it Twice!
3278;Oh well, it is a fun film and everyone I know wants to see it so.
3279;tobey Maguire is great, as usual, as is Willem Dafoe.
3280;But overall, it is a fun story and it was entertaining to watch Maguire's discovery of who he has become as it unfolds.
3281;The acting, pace, action, and humor were all done to near perfection.
3282;I love extras, but rarely find myself viewing the extras multiple times.
3283;I especially liked the montage of Spidey artists over time .
3284;great insights to one of the greatest super hero characters of all time.
3285;With the edition of the extras this movie becomes exciting.
3286;The Stan Lee interview is absolutely fascinating.
3287;Stan Lee is a saint.
3288;This has got to be the nicest man in the world.
3289;man, Fantastic Four, and others, he always mentions the team of people who helped to make them a success.
3290;This guy is an excellent story teller.
3291;man is a movie that has become one of the most successful films of all time.
3292;The comic strip is the most popular in the world and now the films are hitting the big screen.
3293;It holds many records at the box office and made a huge $117 million in its opening weekend.
3294;man comic books, Films, Cartoon Films, Console games, merchandise and much more!
3295;man II will hit the cinemas in 2004.
3296;I looked forward to seeing Tobey Maguire (one of Hollywood's greatest at the moment) portray the web.
3297;I've noticed the bulk of these reviews are very positive.
3298;I want to talk about the film itself.
3299;First let me say I love superhero movies and I did enjoy Spiderman to some degree.
3300;I refer to the banter between him and Dunst, involving how beautiful he thinks she is and BLAAAHHHH!!!
3301;The hollywood film industry is becoming like fast food.
3302;Macguire was well casted, DaFoe was hilarious, Dunst is georgeous and there's always a chance the sequel might be an improvement.
3303;i cant believe that HE was the best one for the role.
3304;there is barely a vibe of adrenaline to be found anywhere in this film.
3305;i didnt feel inspired to get behind one of my favorite comic book heroes whom i've loved for years.
3306;and as a fan of the serial, i feel jipped.
3307;Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are both terrific in this movie, as are the supporting cast members.
3308;The Movie and the first two Batman movies.
3309;most comic heroes didn't kill their adversaries.
3310;on it's own i did find it entertaining and fun to watch.
3311;This is a movie which follows the comic book development of the charactors with great zeal.
3312;Costumes are excellent as are the special effects.
3313;Casting is superb and one can only hope that future sequels will use the same Parker, Harry Osborn and Jamison.
3314;the story line is clear and easy to understand.
3315;all in all and outstanding movie .
3316;suitable for everyone in the family.
3317;I hope that the next movie will be equally as good.
3318;This put Peter Parker in a state of perpetual anxiety and moral conflict and created great suspense in the storyline
3319;The actors were likeable and the story was touching and well.
3320;Was a gift for a grandson and he loved it.
3321;He is in to super heros and he would recommend this to others that are in to super heros.
3322;If you have well calibrated your equipment, color improvement works!
3323;Great color and contrast, perfect definition, but no extras at all.
3324;this is a fun movie and aside from the goblins power ranger mask it was well done and stayed pretty true to the original comics.
3325;man is a dream come true to the true fans of the comic series as well as a pleasant surprise to moviegoers who are looking for a decent and exciting storyline of a superhero.
3326;The storyline covers in good measured detail Peter Parker's path from high school teenage period to a hero with a burden and a matured mind.
3327;focus, M. j. and the pure and committed love expressed throughout by Peter Parker.
3328;Such noble and pure feelings of a introverted boy for a girl next door, old fashioned but in such a manner that proves that a love theme is always powerful and above every action packed sequence.
3329;the Green Goblin character demanded more attention since such a modern Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theme is essential to the dramatization of the story.
3330;The ending provides the base of Peter Parker's tragedy.
3331;The girl that he loved since he was six year old must finally be deprived of his true feelings for her.
3332;Simply, because he cherishes her life much more than his love gratification, he understands that Spider.
3333;congratulations to all the people involved in the movie.
3334;We all hope for a great follow up that is based on the very same ethics of story telling and of course new and more developed evil characters.
3335;man film on their merits as films in a superhero film series.
3336;Thank you for your understanding.
3337;and ultimately made the best of the situation by becoming a superhero.
3338;With that being the tale, it's a pretty good tale as told in this film.
3339;His love interest, Mary Jane, played by Kirsten Dunst, is someone I could have done without.
3340;man himself, my two favorite characters (they're tied for this honor) are Uncle Ben and J. Jonah Jameson.
3341;Well filmmakers, a job well done.
3342;He may be funny and perhaps a bit over.
3343;top, but it all only contributes to this character and makes him unique among the newspaper editors that so many superheroes seem to have in their lives.
3344;Plus, J. K. Simmons is just a great actor and always worth watching.
3345;Willem Dafoe played a power.
3346;James Franco, playing Harry Osborn, was a bit more complex and this set him up perfectly for the coming sequels.
3347;man is the best comicbook hero adaptation I have ever seen on the big screen.
3348;Besides the outstanding effects Spider.
3349;man also had fantastic character developement and a script that actually told the story of Peter Parker.
3350;The special features alone make it worth the price.
3351;William DeFoe plays the best villian yet.
3352;He was one of the first choices.
3353;man is an epic thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat.
3354;Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor in all the movies he acts in.
3355;Hopefully they will keep Joel Schumacker away from it as we saw what he did to the terrific BATMAN franchise.
3356;man is an entertaining film that is a great summertime, popcorn movie.
3357;Tobey Maguire is quite good in the title role.
3358;He plays the character with the right amount of torment as an outcast who has been put down all his life, but injects pride, joy and happiness into the Peter from his newly bestowed powers.
3359;Ms. Dunst is not given much to work worth in the character, she is the requisite love interest, damsel in distress but she is appealing in the role.
3360;Mr. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Goblin and he handles the character's schizophrenic outbursts with creepy aplomb.
3361;The film was a box office smash and we should expect to see numerous sequels that will hopefully be as appealing as the first installment.
3362;This movie is another one of the must.
3363;The story is amazing and dramatic.
3364;The plot may be a bit simple, but it is epic and will have you on the edge of your seat.
3365;man is one of the most refreshing comic book hero movies to ever come out.
3366;man fan with the action figures and comic books.
3367;man was just one of the most amazing movie experiences (along with E. t.) ever.
3368;This movie truly has a great stand out cast.
3369;man did an amazing job.
3370;He brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie.
3371;Together the two just ignited the big screen and as the sparks flew it gave the movie a romantic twist.
3372;The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times.
3373;All that along with the emotional journey that Spider.
3374;man takes you on, thats what truly makes this movie so great and special.
3375;coaster ride i highly encourage any one to see.
3376;The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure.
3377;There's so much I enjoyed about this film.
3378;I actually got to see Spider.
3379;In Japan it is highly unusual for a movie to come out on the same date as in America, there's unusually at least a 3 month wait.
3380;But surprisingly, I was able to see Spider.
3381;High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is while very smart is the school freak.
3382;He is also very much in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) though he won't approach her.
3383;But the next day, he wakes up to find himself with perfect vision and also a more muscular body!
3384;He soon finds out though that with his new powers comes great responsibility.
3385;man has got it all!
3386;*ACTING*: Kirsten Dunst is very believable as the not.
3387;perfect Mary Jane with her family and love problems.
3388;He can show his expressions so well, from his shy smile to Mary Jane, his turmoil of grief, his determination to stop Green Goblin, and his excitement when he first tries out his superpowers.
3389;The story has plenty of surprises and twists, making the whole entire time very enjoyable.
3390;The first thirty minutes or so was very light, I was laughing a lot on the mishaps of Peter Parker's previous life to becoming Spider.
3391;The end might put off some people but I found it highly satisfying.
3392;As for the humor and seriousness of the film, I always believe that most all movies should have the right balance of these two points.
3393;man was great, having plenty of humor to keep my laughing yet a serious tone to it which was essential to the movie.
3394;*ACTION AND F/X*: The action is so well done that through the last hour or so of the movie I was on the edge of my seat!
3395;man and the Green Goblin were very exciting, the last 'battle' (as there usual is) the most tense.
3396;man does not only get to fly and fling himself through the air, he also gets to do a lot of hand.
3397;The F/X were pretty real yet had a sort of comic book feel to it making it very easy to watch and enjoy.
3398;well you know, a spider!
3399;so my conclusion is, Spider.
3400;I also recommend two other super.
3401;hero movies which are my favorites, Superman with Christopher Reeve and The Shadow with Alec Baldwin.
3402;Batman was also interesting though it didn't make much of an impression on me.
3403;I personally love Kirsten's hair red, and I think it looks much prettier long then cropped.
3404;But the movie still had a lot of action, adventure, and what made the 2nd movie so good, romance.
3405;man fan, or are a Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst fan, you will probably enjoy this movie.
3406;Was happy to see that this came in perfect condition.
3407;My son loves this movie over all the other spidermans
3408;I'm glad I did as I thoroughly enjoyed myself!
3409;Another great movie for the entire family, not just for kids .
3410;The special effects are wonderful!
3411;I do admit that Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin mask was just a bit corny looking, but the awesome special effects pretty much make up for that.
3412;I still think he was a great choice for the part, as were Tobey Maguire and James Franco for theirs.
3413;All in all, it's a great action packed movie that really pulls you into the story, and I for one can't wait for a sequel.
3414;They did a great job.
3415;A film you can watch again and again.
3416;I went in with high expectations and all were exceeded.
3417;The action was realistic .
3418;the swinging and the web weaving marvelous.
3419;The characters were endearing, believable and yet comic strip characters nonetheless.
3420;action, suspense, great characters, love, romance, sadness, happiness, and some great acting.
3421;This Spider man film is ultra cool.
3422;I was interested in watching it because it's a super hero movie but where I'm ultra clueless because I don't actually read the comic book, it just made it a more enjoyable experience.
3423;man is not my #1 favorite super hero, but he is definitely in my top 5.
3424;I think they did an excellent job of this movie and # 2 and 3 as well.
3425;I can relate to Peter Parker in alot of ways, but I prefer Batman's attitude over Spidey's.
3426;the movie teaches a great moral: With great power comes great responsibility.
3427;Any important person will tell you this.
3428;Of course there are going to be similarities inasmuch as both are based on the origins and exploits of beloved comic book heroes.
3429;The two films feature over.
3430;top performances from the villain (Nicholson as Batman's Joker and Dafoe as The Green Goblin).
3431;A mammoth citywide celebration with music provided by contemporary stars is one of the commonalities in both (Batman had Prince and Spiderman has Macy Gray).
3432;but the main bond between the movies is in the casting of the least likely of performers in the title roles.
3433;thus, Tobey Maguire, surprisingly buffed and confident, dons the tights nicely and believably as the web spinner.
3434;I still think Superman 1 and 2 with Christopher Reeves tops the charts as one of the best superhero movies.
3435;man takes a more down to earth hero from the comics successfully unto the big screen.
3436;Sam Raimi did a great job in bringing out the character as he's supposed to be unlike those tragedic Batman movies.
3437;They did take some liberties in Spiderman's origin and powers but it was still told quite nicely and, in some cases, like his organic webbing was a better change.
3438;Now, Spiderman shows that if you just portray the character seriously enough, you can still use those colorful comic costumes on screen and still be believable.
3439;i think Tobey McGuire did an excellent job as Peter Parker.
3440;And Kirsten Dunst, another character who I didn't think I'd believe in, portrayed a great Mary Jane Watson.
3441;The black bars on the top and bottom aren't as big as other widescreen movies so you still have great picture even at a 27 TV.
3442;Lots of extras on the two disc set.
3443;Great animated menus although the interface is kinda weird with their shortcuts selection method.
3444;The movie itself is a great transfer.
3445;Definitely a great movie at a great price.
3446;i did enjoy the computer graphics animation.
3447;The movie is definately worth a look at on the big screen.
3448;It may be a story lifted from the pages of a comic book, but with some strong performances, a focused story and some great F/X, director Sam Raimi puts blood in the veins of one of the best superheroes ever to hit the big screen.
3449;And let's face it, right now the world needs just such a character
3450;And when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself changed
3451;With this film, Raimi takes a page out of the Tim Burton Book and gives us a character that is convincing and real, because he shows us the man first, and then the superhero.
3452;And it makes all the difference in the world.
3453;The F/X are incredible, and Raimi uses the stunning visual aspect of the film to great effect, but it would all be for naught without the solid core of believable characters he puts into place and then uses as a foundation upon which to build the spectacular.
3454;Raimi definitely knows what works and how to entertain and involve his audience, which he certainly does here.
3455;And this is arguably Raimi's best work yet.
3456;it was inspired casting, as Maguire is perfect as everybody's favorite web.
3457;His appearance, the way he carries himself.
3458;combined with his attitude and the subtle way he expresses himself, are all part and parcel of what brings Peter Parker and Spider.
3459;Maguire, as he has demonstrated previously in such films as The Ice Storm and The Cider House Rules, has a naturally pleasing and accessible personality that serves him so well in the characters he creates, and none more so than with his portrayal of Peter.
3460;He has the talent and ability to aptly convey that ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances scenario and make it believable, which is exactly what was needed to make this film successful
3461;Defoe goes that extra mile to make a Osborn real, and deserves credit for giving him real substance, rather than being satisfied with a one dimensional character that has nothing going on beneath the surface.
3462;The Goblin is a complex character, and Dafoe plays him perfectly.
3463;And only then are we given a glimpse of the direction in which MJ may go, and it will be interesting to see how the character develops in the next installment, now that the groundwork has been ably laid by Dunst.
3464;man is a winner that is going to attract a huge following
3465;man', one of Marvel Comics' best.
3466;fuelled romp through over sixty years of characterisation and carefully developed characters.
3467;kirsten Dunst is relatively good as the winsome Mary Jane Watson, ditto Rosemary Harris as Aunt May.
3468;Great Special Effects, Great extras, and a pretty good plot.
3469;This is an awesome show!
3470;This first movie from the amazing SPIDER MAN must be one of the best movies from comic books!!!
3471;The images os spidey flowing through the city are perfect!
3472;The Green Goblin is really cool, and the story is true to the comics.
3473;Tobey Maguire swings into new heights of excitement in the crowd.
3474;Now, New York's friendly neighborhood Spider.
3475;man is a sensational box.
3476;office spectacle that combines rousing comic.
3477;book adventure and strong human drama.
3478;Director Sam Raimi has captured the spirit and heart of the comic that surely satisfy audiences and fans of the genre.
3479;book and the special effects are good but not quite amazing.
3480;Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast for the role of Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe delivers a devilish performance as the Green Goblin.

3484;Following the cult classic status of Blade and the surprising box office success of X. men, Marvel decided to lend out the rights of another one of their most cherished characters.
3485;It surpassed the success of X. men, and ushered in a decade that would have many more comic book, cartoon, and toy movies set records.
3486;man finally got that due respect.
3487;Like many others of my generation, my fandome really started with the first Spidey film, and then blossomed into collecting stacks upon stacks of comics.
3488;The visual effects were not the standard for the time, especially with the aforementioned Star Wars film coming out, but they were still pretty damn good.
3489;The music was fantastic, thanks to Danny Elfman (the man behind The Simpsons music, and so many other great film scores).
3490;Director Sam Raimi created a truly stylistic and visual masterpiece.
3491;I doubted a director best known for horror movies would do the material justice, but he did not disappoint.
3492;But I always applaud and appreciate big blockbusters that turn lesser names into household names.
3493;Tobey maguire and Dunst had a chemistry that really dold the complex relationship of the two iconic characters they were portraying.
3494;To this day, my favorite character, besides Spider.
3495;Willem Dafoe was great as Norman Osborn.
3496;It serves as a constant reminder that you're watching a cartoon with real people acting it out.
3497;Overrated adaptation of the Spider.
3498;And he's done so in a BIG way!!
3499;man when I was younger I had high expectations for this film.
3500;man is now, and I say without hyperbole, the benchmark that all other comic book movies will be measured against.
3501;He then undergoes a remarkable metamorphesis.
3502;That's what sets him apart from the rest of his super hero bretheren.
3503;The human element is what really sets the film apart from many of the other comic book movies.
3504;kirsten Dunst is absolutley radiant as Mary Jane Watson.
3505;There is a certain sweetness to the underlying love story that is genuine.
3506;But it's those underdog qualities that endear you to him.
3507;wilem Defoe turns in a riveting performance as one of Spideys oldest foes, the Green Goblin.
3508;The armor may look a little hokey but it's Defoe's mannerisms that really make this an inspired choice for him.
3509;the CGI effects really make you believe he can do whatever a spider can.
3510;this is one hero for the ages.
3511;I can go on all day about this film.
3512;To him life is a great big bang up, wherever there's a hangup you'll find the Spider.
3513;For those of us who have been waiting literally years for this, one of the greatest comic book series ever, to come to larger.
3514;life enormity on the big screen, this film is a godsend.
3515;mAN (2002), as brilliantly directed by the wonderful Sam Raimi (one of the most successful cult directors in film history), delivers BIG.
3516;It is perfectly cast, from Tobey Maguire in the title role.
3517;probably the role he was born to play.
3518;enemy, to the beautiful Kirsten Dunst, the girl he would love to ask out on a date.
3519;shy Peter Parker, who of course turns into Spider.
3520;I've seen Maguire in both PLEASANTVILLE (1997) and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (1999) and I just knew that he fit Peter Parker to a T. Also perfectly cast is Willem Dafoe, as well.
3521;fest THE EVIL DEAD (1983), and the even better (and funnier) EVIL DEAD 2 (1987), before going on to direct the wonderful DARKMAN (1990) and then finishing the EVIL DEAD trilogy with ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993).
3522;More known to a wide TV audience as the exec producer of the Hercules and Xena series, Sam Raimi is now making his triumphant return to feature films.
3523;And what a triumph this film is!SPIDER.
3524;mAN has action, fun, brains, brawn, suspense, and most importantly, a great storyline which blends the traditional comic.
3525;Sam Raimi and the screenwriter found a way to not alienate the original fans, while incorporating today's hip humor and attitudes.
3526;:)To sum up: Great cast, great acting, great action, great story, great direction, great visuals, filmed in NYC.
3527;My grand child requested spiderman comics as a gift.
3528;And the Green Goblin was the best acting in the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3529;anticipated comic book movie adaptation ever, next to the X. men, and it may have taken years to bring this about, but it is definitely worth the wait.
3530;He really brings the character to life, embodying many of the deep qualities we love and admire from the comics and the cartoon, but in a majorly human way.
3531;man's FIRST love interest, but then I saw that Kirsten had dyed her hair, so it pretty much indicated that MJ was in this film.
3532;this movie was excellent on so many levels, it was intelligent, it was funny, it was touching, it was dramatic, it was action.
3533;packed, everything you would love in a movie.
3534;On top of that, it's Spider.
3535;Everyone loves that wall crawler.
3536;I'm definitely excited about the sequels!
3537;visualist Sam Raimi (a master of the floating camera), and with nice, understated, naturalistic performances by Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.
3538;Who is this Green Goblin character, and will Spiderman be able to stop him?The Movie: It has a very comic book feel at times, which is a good thing.
3539;The acting moves back and forth from very good to rather hokey.
3540;The best acting comes from Willem Dafoe, whose scenes as the split personality Dr. Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin stand out as some of the best in the movie.
3541;Kirsten Dunst, while great to look at, is nothing special as Mary Jane in Spiderman.
3542;And Toby, perfectly cast as Parker, and although some say he isn't the one they would have pegged as Spiderman, he's a perfect Peter Parker, and since Spidy and Parker are one and the same, it would only make sense.
3543;cut action movie with the classic Raimi touches like his brother being in the movie, the Cadillac makes a return appearance, and Bruce Campbell makes a cameo as the Ring Announcer.
3544;the Video: Talk about a great transfer.
3545;As for the rest of the people on the Commentary, including Raimi and producers Laura Ziskin and Grant Curtis, they all said stuff that was interesting and worth listening to (in reference to the visuals of the movie).
3546;The comic book world was done a service when Spiderman was released.
3547;The producers did the best job that was possible in creating a great Spiderman movie.
3548;The actors were good, especially Tobey Maguire.
3549;Otherwise this is an excellent movie and definitely one to own.
3550;The reason is that Superman took itself pretty seriously.
3551;It is, quite simply, the comic book come to life.
3552;So I speak here with authority.
3553;This film **is** the comic book.
3554;If you liked the comic book, you'll like the film.
3555;OK, fine, so the special effects don't look 100% authentic (they're great, just not believable).
3556;Like they were authentic and realistic in the comic book?
3557;This is a great movie for what it is.
3558;And unlike so many dreary films these days, this one has an actual storyline, a love interest, a dash of humor, and overall is great fun.
3559;Come on, Mary Jane is gorgeous, and Peter seems like a normal guy, excepting that he's Spider.
3560;My 4 year old son, 10 year old daughter, and their 48 year old dad all loved it.
3561;I know a lot of people loved this movie.
3562;I didn't see what's so amazing about it.
3563;especially compared to the infinitely more complex and sophisticated X. men from a few years back, not to mention the brilliant Darkman from way back in 1990.
3564;In Darkman, Raimi brought a seriousness of purpose and a uniqueness of vision to the project that helped to carry the comic book movie genre to new artistic heights.
3565;book in its narrative, tone and purpose that it never soars much above the ordinary and never carries the audience to the kind of exciting, visionary world one would expect from a film of this type.
3566;The movie is blessed in one all.
3567;important respect though: its inspired decision to cast Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, a mild mannered nerd who becomes a super hero after he's bitten by a genetically altered spider.
3568;Maguire's winning and disarming performance is the film's one incontestable virtue.
3569;The love scenes between Spider.
3570;which pretty much leaves us with the special effects.
3571;Though adequate at times, many of the shots of Spider.
3572;Perhaps since we feel no immediate involvement in the proceedings, the special effects sequences never manage to catch us up in the excitement of what they are showing us.
3573;the story starts with the creation of our super.
3574;These include great strength, agility, the ability to shoot webs from his wrists, and to kiss gorgeous babes while hanging upside.
3575;focus, 2002), faced with a funding cut.
3576;I really enjoy spiderman because this was pretty much the first hero about a Marvel character that Stan Lee actually got to be a part of and help direct and you can see it easily.
3577;man is the costume, all the scenes are just amazing, I guess that's why he's the amazing spider.
3578;man is the perfect spiderman, after seeing the new amazing spiderman I hated that movie compared to this one that other guy they have playing spiderman I hated he looks like darth vader.
3579;this was def the best spider man movie easy, and for being over 2 hours it is worth watching again, actually after every time you read a spider man comic book you should watch this movies, its that awesome.
3580;Go in expecting pure entertainment and unbelivable fantasy and you'll have a great time with Spider.
3581;It is funny, exciting, thrilling and (unfortunately) romantic.
3582;Outside the first wall climbing sequence which was pathetically bad (obvious wire work), the rest was excellent (albeit obvious CG).
3583;I loved all the superhero comics.
3584;in many ways I identified mostly with Spider.
3585;They are human people, in addition to being superheroes.
3586;man for the first time?I just loved the movie.
3587;Yes, I loved the thrill of action.
3588;All of the actors seemed just perfect for the parts they played.Yes, I can't say it enough.
3589;I just loved the first Spider.
3590;man movie, and the second one as well.
3591;great product, suspenseful, would recommend it, fun, entertaining, worth it, great alone or with family, sci.
3592;This is without a doubt one of the best movies i've ever seen i first thought that since most of spider.
3593;Sam Rami's director of Darkman summer mega blockbuster SpiderMan earned 100 million in less then two days which easily made itthis summers highest grossing film of the summer banking in at 500 million worldwide to make it one of the top grossing movies of all time.
3594;but What made it endearing to fans was it's abilityto stay with the original storyline.
3595;loaded with hours of special features and making of documentaries if you love Batman and Superman you'll love SpiderMan but if they do make a sequel let's hope they keep Tobey it wouldn't be the same without him.
3596;, he's too infatuated with the lovely Mary.
3597;fans know, Peter pays for his capitalist intentions, and learns the hard way how his new power brings new responsibilities.
3598;Donning a mask and acquiring a split personality and an arsenal of high.
3599;hearted father of Peter's best friend .
3600;The movie works up to a climactic battle near Roosevelt Island where Peter must battle until their masks are stripped away.
3601;moving flick brought the whole experience back.
3602;Though a lot of Spiderman draws on the comic series (and also turns up the fun for Sam Raimi fans), and much of the rest is generic comic book.
3603;This is obviously the same movie Raimi wanted to make about a decade ago, when he helmed Darkman (the last few minutes of each film are essentially the same) and it was well worth the wait.
3604;as i have now just seen it for the third time i can truly say this is an excellent film.
3605;tobey macquire was a sound choice and fits the role perfectly.
3606;throughout the entire movie the writers/director manage to keep you well interested (albiet three times) while keeping a brisk pace,and yet doing a fine job of following the origins of spider.
3607;The movie is definitely awesome.
3608;SPiderman has long been my favorite superhero, and this movie does good justice to the comic book.
3609;The features are good and overall I think this is worth the time and money.
3610;In fact, one of the things that really works here is that the origin of the hero and the origin of the villain are both developed as fast as they can and at the same time.
3611;but with Dafoe's delivery, you can see the theatrical megalomania as a natural part of the character.
3612;A few of the effects using CG characters could use a bit more polish to make them feel real, but they thankfully use real actors whenever realistically possible.
3613;I agree with all who say that it is probably the best comic book adaptation available.
3614;The movie was freckin awesome, great effects, great story, great acting, great everything.
3615;I just hope Star Wars Attack of the Clones will live up to this movie.
3616;This thrilling film was one of the most magnificent features Marvel has brought to screen.
3617;It is about a teenage boy, living in the city, and soon he will realize how it is to be known as a world famous super hero from the sky.
3618;Easily one of the best comic book films ever, spiderman is nothing short of a right place, right time film.
3619;I love how film didnt show off all of what spiderman can do, which will make spiderman 2 even more kick ass.
3620;I also love the fact the they didnt not really use universally known actors in the leading roles.
3621;This movie was more realistic and more correct.
3622;Great start to which will become a great franchise.
3623;man came out people were finally happy to see a comic book movie do justice.
3624;man gives you a great character, plenty of action, and a great storyline.
3625;And Sam Raimi was the perfect director for this one.
3626;It disects the movie from every angle.
3627;A Must Have for all comic book fans.
3628;I had very high expectations on seeing this movie.
3629;The special effects were wonderful and the art direction the film had was unlike any other I had ever seen in a comic book film.
3630;The setting was bold, colorful, cheery, and vibrant.
3631;It was a really awesome film.
3632;I reccomend this for anyone who loves comic book films, and if they are fans of the stars than this is a definate must.
3633;one of the best films of the 2000s.
3634;This film is easily one of the best action movies that I've ever watched.
3635;The acting was phenomonal, the stunts great, the action superb, and the plot was outstanding.
3636;It shows how he got bitten by the super spider and how his whole entire life was transformed from a high school kid into a crime fighting superhero.
3637;this film is so monumental and had such a huge success at the box office because of the character of Spider.
3638;man has been around for about 40 years and this is the first live action screenplay featuring the loved superhero.
3639;Moviegoers and comic book readers can identify with Peter Parker because he is just an ordinary guy until he is bit by a spider.
3640;It is very easy to spot Peter's weaknesses and stengths and to compare them towards your own.
3641;Sam Raimi, the director of this film, succeeded so well in the production because he accurately portrayed Spider.
3642;man, and all of the other characters for that matter, so well.
3643;Credit should also be given to the talented actors and actresses that starred in this movie.
3644;Those are the reasons for the huge success of this film.
3645;the portrayals of each character was done brilliantly because of great actors.
3646;Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker and suits the role that he is playing very well.
3647;the action sequences were done marvelously and these scenes helped make the movie what it is.
3648;The costume and makeup team did a fabulous job and they did a great job of bringing Spider.
3649;Finally, the drama was great and in every scene you will be able to feel for the characters.
3650;What made this film so great was that it was very realistic and it seems like the events in this film actually happened.
3651;man is definitely the best film that I've seen all year and this now holds a place in the top ten of my favorite films.
3652;This film will not only be enjoyed by comic book readers but by kids and adults that have never read a Spidey comic before.
3653;This is defintiely worth seeing many, many times.
3654;This movie was well written and well directed.
3655;I went into the theater expecting a movie that would be about equal with one of the Batman sequels but I got much more!
3656;Not only is this better than ALL the Batman movies but it's the best Comic Book movie adaption ever!
3657;Toby Maguire is perfect as Spider.
3658;He is totally believable in the role and he is one of the few comic book movie heroes that have depth.
3659;Kirsten Dunst is perfectly cast as Mary Jane and her fine acting also brings depth to her character.
3660;This is surely William Dafoe's BEST on screen role ever!
3661;The rest of the cast is great as well!
3662;Sam Raimi again shows his suberb talent behind the camera and it all assembles together for the Perfect Summer Movie!
3663;It was well deserving of it's $115 million dollar opening!
3664;When the film is over it leaves you wanting more!
3665;It's a nice package, with a film cel, litho drawn by Spidey legeneds the Romitas, and other goodies.
3666;fi/fantasy nut, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
3667;the special effects in this are quite stunning, and the acting performances help to maintain a poignant and dreamy atmosphere throughout.
3668;If you want a dreamy, poignant, heartwarming film to watch (with all of those excellent special effects to spare), I highly recommend this.
3669;The casting of this film was perfect and offered a refreshing spin on the characters of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson especially.
3670;The movie truly shines in its adaption of the origin story, capturing aspects of the tale that I honestly thought had no hope of getting screen time.
3671;The resulting character is excellent and we end up caring for MJ and her conflicts.
3672;Thus it may be said that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were brilliant in this film.
3673;but when the film is good, its great.
3674;Highlighted by a great romance plot (the real plot in my opinion), and a bevy of amazing webslinging scenes, the movie is highly entertaining.
3675;Scenes with Uncle Ben kind of cause the mystery behind his character to dissolve.
3676;Tobey Maguire in the best portrayal of Spiderman and especially Peter Parker I have seen.
3677;Kirsten Dunst as a very likeable MJ 3.)
3678;A very well adapted Origin story 4.)
3679;J. Jonah Jameson is hilarious.
3680;When the comedy is good, it is charming and entertaining.
3681;all in all, this was a great movie and one that will draw a returned audience.
3682;I know I'm planning to see it again tomorrow.
3683;It may now be said that Spiderman is the film series to watch for.
3684;Toby Macguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Willem Dafoe all do a great job in this action packed movie from 2002.
3685;Toby is a fantastic actor, really plays Spiderman as a vulnerable yet strong, complicated super.
3686;For me, this is the best superhero movie yet (including Superman(1978), Spider.
3687;It is true to his origins, develops the characters well and it connects very well on a human level.
3688;man comic books themselves always had a good deal of humor and this movie is consistent with that.
3689;man films, he is the perfect choice for this because he understands the character and the nature of this comic so well.
3690;So rarely is a superhero movie made by a director who fundamentally understands its subject.
3691;In that sense, this movie is a dream come true for fans of this comic.
3692;Until Batman Begins, this was really the first superhero movie to accurately portray its character onscreen.
3693;This seems counterintuitive, yet it makes the movie faithful to its comic hero source and ultimately more realistic.
3694;And then there is the love story, which is realistic because Mary Jane dates Harry Osborn, the good looking, wealthy jerk actually unworthy of her.
3695;She is the unattainable for Peter Parker, the intelligent, thoroughly decent kid who has the misfortune of being penniless and average looking.
3696;Once he attains his powers, he knows he will forever endanger those close to him.
3697;The movie features excellent graphics and effects, very good acting, a terrific story and script, and just about everything one could want in a movie.
3698;The sum total is a film so entertaining and so good, even my wife left the theater proclaiming it her new favorite film.
3699;the movie, the story was great and this film is surely worth it.
3700;This movie is truly a dream come true for a long time Spider.
3701;and he did what a true fan would do.
3702;He stayed true to the source and to the material.
3703;He captured the essence of Spider.
3704;Rami stayed true to the comic.
3705;It is a well plotted story that moves effortlessly from point to point.
3706;But boy does he deliver!
3707;She's a lovely girl but not the super.
3708;model that MJ is in the comic book.
3709;But I was pleasantly surprised with what was done with the character.
3710;after being disapointed with the unseeminly endless rubish that Hollywood has produced lately I am now, in the words of Mr. Stan Lee, a true believer.
3711;My four year d and two year old love Spider.
3712;We had so much fun watching this!
3713;Me too!I loved Spidey.1, loved Spidey.2, can't wait for Spidey.3!!!
3714;I love the theme song Hero.
3715;And they could have done so much more with it!
3716;I am embarassed that the top five U. s. box office hits ever include Titanic, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, and this movie.
3717;I thought (contrary to what I expected) that Episode II was more entertaining.
3718;All in all, it is an enjoyable but not *special* movie.
3719;The most disturbing thing is that there was so much potential to create a really stunning film, and what is delivered is instead adequate entertainment in the form of a summer blockbuster seemingly only concerned with making money.
3720;Hopefully the sequels will be better.
3721;2002 saw the start of the era of the comic book movie, one that was heavy on tight storylines, great special effects and cunning direction.
3722;Marvel Comics prime superhero, his story is interesting, his facts everyone can relate to.
3723;there is humor in the piece, but also a lot of raw human emotion.
3724;If you have ever gone through teh grief process, you can relate to Aunt May and Peter's loss of Uncle Ben.
3725;sam Raimi put together a great story here, taking the basic elements of the original Marvel Comics tale and made some changes.
3726;disc of the widescreen edition is really hot.
3727;In Disc 2, it's full of interviews, screen tests, special effects mysteries revealed and so on.
3728;Spiderman is the most impressive comic book turned to movie yet.
3729;I remember seeing Superman:the movie and in awe about how interesting it was.
3730;He has brought a lot of heart and compassion to this movie.
3731;Anyways go see Spiderman and have a good time.
3732;Sam Raimi did not dissapoint and it has since become one of my favorite movies.
3733;the first is by director Raimi, Producer Curtis, Actress Dunst, and producer Ziskin.
3734;I wasn't as entertained with this one but it is fairly interesting to hear their stories about what went on with the stunt work and some of the scenes.
3735;two music videos are included, as well as HBO and E! Making.
3736;These are always a lot of fun to watch.
3737;man in the comics, Peter Parker's girlfriends, some common Spider.
3738;man enemies, and an excellent comic book archive.
3739;sense navigational feature that lets you click on an icon at certain points in the film.
3740;What a smart and action packed movie.
3741;The movie goes into great detail about the how's and why's of spiderman without letting it slow the story down.
3742;Add in a love story and a story about a boy just trying to fit in.
3743;This is a wonderful movie that I must recomend.
3744;man starring Tobey Maguire is definitely one of my all.
3745;This film pleasantly met all of my expectations as a Spider.
3746;man fan and as a novelist and screenwriter.
3747;It is a wonderful story about young Peter Parker who is bitten by a high powered genetically enhanced spider, which transforms him from a nerd into the crime fighting, web spinning Spider.
3748;The main storyline is accompanied by a touching subplot that involves the childhood love of Peter's heart, Mary Jane(MJ) played by Kirsten Dunst.
3749;As these two storylines interweave, Peter expresses his long overdue affection for MJ in dramatic fashion by springing to her rescue as the high flying superhero.
3750;This film pulls the viewer into a nail.
3751;man clash in the finale, bringing the audience to a breathtaking and satisfying climax.
3752;I recommend this feature to all Spider.
3753;man fans and to those who enjoy a good story.
3754;The actual film cell is amazing.
3755;The box that the set comes in is very nice.
3756;this is well spent money for fans and non fans alike.
3757;the description of product was clear and delivery made it well within the time alotted
3758;The movie was nothing but excellent.
3759;The acting was great and Tobey Maguire was perfect for the roll as Spider.
3760;This movie kept me hooked from the moment the titles began until the ending credits.
3761;life comic book movie, Spiderman is outstandingly fantastic.
3762;Tobey Maguire did an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spiderman.
3763;The movie is full of action.
3764;packed special effects, great action scenes and full of adventure.
3765;When he takes them off he can see perfectly (Remember: Spiders can't see with glasses).
3766;He is suddenly very muscular like.
3767;It's pretty cool what happens at school with these powers.
3768;Will he win?Here is where the stuff hits the fan.
3769;Right now Spiderman wins and saves Mary Jane.
3770;Goblin has Spiderman at his knees because on top of the Brooklyn bridge, Goblin holds Mary Jane over on edge of the bridge on one side.
3771;Now, I'll let you see for yourself how Spiderman saves the day.
3772;If you like Spiderman you have to see this real.
3773;Also an EXCELLENT job by the actors.
3774;man is the most exiting movie of the summer.
3775;It has action,passion,love,friendship and evil.
3776;Just a great movie to re watch with the upgrades.
3777;terrific sounds, great visuals, it's like watching it for the first time.
3778;This is a very good movie.
3779;The story is good, the characters are solid, the fighting and effects are good and I liked it.
3780;They have a lot of talking in this movie as well.
3781;I think this is the best superhero series there is.
3782;Overall, I'd say its even better than X. men, which was another solid superhero series that I personally enjoyed.
3783;But it was still a good movie.
3784;So if you like superheroes, or if you just want to see an unsually good action movie that has more to it than just plain action (such as love, friendships, and struggles for power) than this is the movie for you.
3785;I would recommend this movie to anyone interested.
3786;DC comics has had it's days with the Superman and Batman movies.
3787;Oh sure, Xmen was a good effort.
3788;And so was Blade (with its sequel due in March).
3789;When all you see is the eye.
3790;I hope to Stan Lee that I'm wrong and we actually get a great plot as well as great effects and action.
3791;Spiderman will be a hit, regardless.
3792;With all of the factors the other reviewers mentioned such as the actors, director, and effects, it will definitely give Star Wars: Episode II some serious competition.
3793;Spiderman won't be great, but it will be (darn) good!!
3794;This movie is very overrated!
3795;man movie a while ago, on this two.
3796;disc widescreen edition, and I thought it was awesome.
3797;I really cared for the characters here and sympathised with all of them.
3798;man was very well done.
3799;Tobey Maguire and Cliff Robertson are both excellent in that scene.
3800;all of the performances here are great.
3801;I didn't think Maguire could pull off a superhero, but he is amazing as both the nerdy Peter Parker and as the wall.
3802;He is a great actor, and chooses very diverse and complex roles.
3803;He mixes all these things up in some scenes and the outcome is one great performance.
3804;Kirsten Dunst is also stunning and makes her character more three.
3805;She was perfectly cast and I love her hair like that.
3806;there were some outstanding action sequences in Spider.
3807;man, which showcases some brilliant sound effects.
3808;The scenes at the parade and also on the bridge were intense, scary and unpredictable, and especially the one at the parade had me practically falling off my seat in tension.
3809;Down came the Goblin and washed the Spider out!
3810;The end really gets on my nerves but brings across the motto of the movie in a brilliant and heartbreaking fashion .
3811;This is more than a superhero movie, much much more, and I can't wait to see the sequel.
3812;The special features are a sight to behold, there are many that really inform you on the movie.
3813;But this movie is packed with lots of features to enjoy.
3814;There is a few documentaries on the casting choices in the movie.
3815;It was an excellently put together package that is most definitely worth your money!
3816;I loved this movie because of the great special effects and awesome storyline.
3817;This movie has it all action, adventure, and even a slight love story.
3818;Oh and also the most innovative kiss seen in movies.
3819;A real blockbuster, and movie you need to own.
3820;It has the classic struggle between good and evil, romance, an action!
3821;I happen to love most of the comic based movies that come on screen.
3822;I liked spider man a lot.
3823;Tobey M. does a good job of being a 'nerd boy' who wakes up one morning being better at everything.
3824;He is the one that stays up late at the lab and studies and researches when everyone else is asleep.
3825;the movie itself is fun to watch.
3826;film is coming out next year)it's good to know we're always have Spidey.
3827;i thought this movie was great.
3828;it has everything:great acting(with amazing performances by Tobey Maguire(Peter/Spidey)and Wilem Dafoe(Norman/Green Goblin)a great plot,some great action scenes,and it's really true to the characters of the comics.
3829;overall,a terrific film and I recommend it.
3830;but his fight with Spiderman at the end is spectacular, as for Falco as Harry.yawn.
3831;if your a fan of Spiderman, you'll like it.
3832;It is one of the profoundly coolest effects offered by the movie.
3833;I actually made noise, a wow here and an oooh there.
3834;thanks so much for at least having this available to others who want it.
3835;Sam Raimi Brings all the energy and excitement from His Hercules and Xena TV shows to the movie adaptation of Spider.
3836;This bright, energetic film stays true to the spirit of the comics.
3837;The story is easy to follow and is full of fun campy moments that will have you laughing, and on the edge of your seat with the action packed scenes that were ripped from a comic book.
3838;Tobey Maguire gives a great performance as does the rest of the cast.
3839;I bought this for my grand.
3840;Spider man the movie is simply the one and only best movie in the planet!!!!!
3841;I watched it twice in two days in a row!
3842;this may be considered a super hero movie, but what make's this film so good is it's more about Peter Parker and his feelings for Mary Jane than anything else.
3843;Of course there's lots of action and special effects, but it's the story that really shines and that's why the movie was seen by such a wide variety of age groups.
3844;The soundtrack is great too.
3845;This is a wonderful movie.
3846;One of it's finest qualites is the fact that it can be enjoyed by everyone in the family, regardless of their ages.
3847;It's an instant classic and a must have.
3848;All I have to say is.
3849;This movie is action packed and the special effects are awesome.
3850;And you gotta love Sam Raimi director of this movie and the classic Evil Dead!
3851;Willam Defoe is of course brilliant as the Green Goblin.
3852;Kirsten Dunst is absolutely stunning as Mary Jane Watson!!!
3853;Gotta love her as a red head!!!
3854;Marvel comics have brought comics into the 21st century with very exciting films that was started with the x. men.
3855;Not only do they honour the comics of old with their screen adaptations, but draw a new audience into their fantasy worlds.
3856;Two big thumbs up to the crews who have made these comics into action.
3857;packed films for all to enjoy.
3858;It's hard to dislike a movie that made comic book adaptations cool to the general public again.
3859;The film gets everything right, from the origin story to the crush on Mary Jane.
3860;man is a good film.
3861;Worth grabbing now, or wait till movie 3 is released next year and the en evitable box set.
3862;man is the MOST anticipated movie of my life thus far.
3863;When I first saw the trailer my heart started thumping so fast, adrenaline started rushing.
3864;I hope to the Lord that this movie will bring in more money than some friggin' Harry Potter.
3865;Go see this movie, it will amaze you!!
3866;Recent movies look great and sound great espescially with DTS or Dolby EX.
3867;This is a great example.
3868;Spider Man is a great movie.
3869;It encompasses all the great aspects of the real comic book hero (super strength, webs, alter.
3870;the movie is flawlessly done, complete with stunning special effects, a good story (it's the complete story of the Green Goblin), and the romance between Spider Man and Mary Jane.
3871;man fashion, mind you), and I wondered, I pondered, and I wondered some more.
3872;Was I fully content with the movie?
3873;But ultimately, what did the comic.
3874;star rating at best, but as slumber began taking its toll on my eyes, I heard the exceptional musical score reemerge into my eardrums, I remembered those number of ridiculously amusing scenes instigating an outburst of guffaws throughout the audience, and when I began to visualize the incredibly nimble Spider.
3875;shooting was hilarious, why did Stan Lee and his gang give a thumbs up to revise the original method of Spider.
3876;The day after Peter Parker was bitten by the genetically enhanced spider (by the way, it actually doesn't skitter away in the Spidey pages, it fell lifelessly to the ground after it sunk its incisors on Parker), was a excellent scene as Parker invests time to master his powers and simultaneously worsens his relationship with his Uncle Ben.
3877;The wrestling match was just as brilliant, as Macho Man was ill.
3878;Full of sarcastic humor, your friendly neighborhood Spider.
3879;man, digs up all the glory for accomplishing an extraordinary adaptation on the big screen.
3880;The movie stirred up excitement, engrossment, and overall kept me satisfied for spending serious dough on costly tickets.
3881;star rating would do the justice, my comic book fancy and sensibilities were bursting in elation, and I was finally decisive to give the wall.
3882;star rating at the top, this movie merits all of them!
3883;man has pulled off, Marvel rips up the competition and I'm roaring in delight!
3884;It starts well enough and Peter Parkers discovery of his new found powers is well done both in the School scenes and later in the wrestling/cage fight.
3885;The fight in the school is very well done and Parker's discovery of his new much faster reactions remains perhaps the highpoint of the film.
3886;Its in this section of the film that the director Sam Raimi's touch is most evident.
3887;The leading actors did a fine job and the best thing in the film is Tobey Maquire, whose portrayal is spot.
3888;This movie was even better than i thought it would be, and i thought it was going to be great.
3889;i love Sam Raimi's work and this has got to be one of his best films next to the evil dead trilogy.
3890;Action Packed, Exciting, Exhilirating,is an understatement to this movie!
3891;I see that most people loved this movie, I have a feeling thats because everything thats come to the movie theatres in recent times has just [disappointed].
3892;first off, this is a great movie.
3893;J. K. Simmons is great as Jameson!!
3894;Nothing is highlighted, just those dots.
3895;Everything else uses a blue box with a color drawing of Spider.
3896;man is a great movie.
3897;mainly reprints of the original ones from the 1960s.)
3898;this is a great movie for fans, and the human issues make it more than simply a comic book movie.
3899;I would recommend the movie highly to fans and non.
3900;I love the movie, I think it is wonderful.
3901;I went to this film with high expectations and was blown away!
3902;It still feels like I dreamt that they made this movie so good!
3903;Tobey Maguire is very believable and gives a powerful performance as both Peter Parker and Spiderman.
3904;Spidey's suit for the most part is unchanged, thank god, and didn't go the Batman movie route!
3905;Dafoe is excellent as the Green Goblin.
3906;Both halves of the movie.
3907;the origin and the scenes as Spider.
3908;man are very exciting and are given equal time.
3909;The origin allows enough time for Peter to discover his powers and to see how he deals with them.
3910;If it was good enough for its' readers through 40 yrs, it should be good enough for now!
3911;The action scenes were incredible.
3912;As in the trailers, the swinging through the city scenes are amazing and are worth the price of admission along with the aerial battles with Spidey and the Goblin on his glider!
3913;Spidey's signature moves and classic flagpole acrobatics from the cartoon are all there!
3914;X. men was great, this blows it away!
3915;This movie had the costumes, and proved that it could work!
3916;This is as good as it gets!!!
3917;My son didn't even touch his candy or popcorn through the whole show!
3918;(all you mothers recognize this is rare).
3919;The graphics and special effects in this film were definately very well done.
3920;I recommend this as a gift for most boys especially where the release date is so near the holiday season.
3921;This movie is everything I impatiently waited for 3 months to see.
3922;The casting is superb, with Dafoe doing an especially good job in a scene where he has a conversation with his two personalities.
3923;Kirsten Dunst also does a great job, showing the audience a depth which before now has not been shown in her characters.
3924;the ending is a nice twist, leaving me hungry for the sequel which will surely come.
3925;When the sequel comes, you can be sure I'll be in line to see it.
3926;It is the best movie ever!!
3927;It has great acting, awesome FX, wicked action and even a bit of romance, but not enough to ruin the film, *cough* Pearl Harbour *cough*I would recommend it to ANYONE.
3928;I've got to say, this movie had it all.
3929;Special effects, good story, morals and even some good music.
3930;Trust me, get this movie and I promise, you'll love it.
3931;This was the greatest comicbook movie ever.
3932;Step aside Superman, Batman, and X. men.
3933;There is a new hero in town, and he's kickin' some major rear.
3934;Luckily they came to their senses, and cast Tobey Maguire, who did a fabulous job.
3935;But Kirsten did a great job.
3936;There was action, comedy, sadness, and even a love story for the ladies.
3937;So it touched all your emotions.
3938;And a two hour movie in an age where a movie that lasts an hour and forty minutes is long, was great.
3939;They stayed pretty true to the comic, not exactly but who cares, it was still the best big studio movie I've seen in a while.
3940;You gotta see this one in the theater.
3941;There's something other to do than screw around on your computer all day!
3942;Remember, With great power, comes great responsibilitySee ya,Spideyy
3943;This movie so AMAZING that not only did I go for a second spin, but also a third and a fourth!
3944;Let me count the ways.
3945;He tells us at the beginning that he loves her.
3946;And he has a good face for the Green Goblin.
3947;(1) The casting is good.
3948;Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker.
3949;(3) The organic webshooters are a good idea, so is the sequence in which Peter Parker explores his new powers.
3950;(4) Finally, the plot sort of made sense, which is rare for superhero movies.
3951;This is a solid two.
3952;In fact, his web is so strong that our eyes are glued to the movie.
3953;and now, he gains super powers as well as the amazing abilities of the spider, transforming him into the web.
3954;swinging hero that we all know a love.
3955;And with this Hollywood adaptation of the classic comic book, we can see Spidey in real action, as well as relive the story.
3956;recommended to action and movie fans everywhere.
3957;Willem Dafoe, oh, he was perfectly cast as the Green Goblin.
3958;He gets the job done, better than any comic book movie villian ever has.
3959;Well, I've see far studlier action heroes but he is pretty good.
3960;the special effects were absolutely thrilling.
3961;Everything looked great with the vital exception of Spiderman himself.
3962;I have now seen it 3 times and it gets better every time!
3963;The special effects are so real and the story line is comfortable for all ages.
3964;Romance, action and Tobey Maguire!
3965;He captures the innocence, nerdiness of Spiderman so well, and plays our down to earth hero with much aplomb.
3966;Despite the awful awful dialogue that plagued the entire film, he managed to deliver his lines as credibly as he possibly could.
3967;this movie has a great plot, an amazing cast, and wild graphics.You won't be disappointed.
3968;I loved the way they stayed true to so much of the original idea of Spider.
3969;The special effects will Blow you away, there were so many great scenes I want to see it again and again so I can be excited all over again.
3970;man comic books since I was a kid and I felt the movie did a great job of bringing Spider.
3971;He is the must human out of al the super heros.
3972;Defoe was all very good as the Green Goblin.
3973;He was my favorite partof the movie.
3974;The action was simply jaw droping.
3975;hard DC people)you will love this movie.
3976;Kids who grew up on the Fox cartoon will enjoy it as well.
3977;I can't wait to see the other Marvel movies ( X. men 2, daredevil, hulk, and the sequel to this) Oh yeah is it better then Batman 1, (bob kane's creation is my favorite comic) I'm not sure, but it's pretty damn close!
3978;The movie is just awesome with great special effects and a nice story too.
3979;They really brought spiderman to life in this movie.
3980;My son is 3 and loves this movie.
3981;He asks to watch it every day.
3982;It's a good thing this Dad likes super heroes.
3983;book hero, but I did see lots of potential for this latest comic.
3984;the film is cast well, overall, especially Peter Parker's aunt and uncle played by Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, and MJ is played with surprisingly pleasing spunk and charm by Kirsten Dunst who can normally be distant in whatever role she plays.
3985;All other supporting cast members are equally good and memorable
3986;tobey is perfect as Peter Parker, a young nerdy kid with a crush on the school's popular girl.
3987;He is also very convincing during the sequences in which he is discovering his new.
3988;go and although he eventually becomes a wonderfully sinister Goblin, with the perfect voice for the role, he is a bit over.
3989;top in that part of his role as well.
3990;as with all introduction episodes of a new comic.
3991;winded and it takes quite some time to get the story rolling, but when it does, it is a compelling, and at times, moving plot, especially when it focuses on Parker's various relationships.
3992;I give Sam Rami, the director, and his writers kudos for that balancing act.
3993;I would like to see more actual stunt work, a la Superman and Batman, than a virtual Spider.
3994;book and seeing him on the screen just brings a smile to my face in spite of whatever flaws may be present.
3995;The film is fun to watch as any comic.
3996;book to film should be, and the effects are good enough to sustain the film although they need to work on the realism factor.
3997;As my headlines read, this new series has promise.
3998;Aiming squarely at the teen audience was clearly the right choice in terms of the box.
3999;budget Hollywood blowout by the guileless performance of Tobey Maguire and the lightly humorous touch of Sam Raimi and his writers.
4000;A darker tone and a more complex story might have made this more interesting, but they can wait for any one of the numerous sequels which are undoubtedly well on their way.
4001;It isn't a great film, but it's an entertaining start to what should be a highly entertaining franchise.
4002;He lives with his aunt May and Uncle Ben.
4003;The latter role was done perfectly by Cliff Robertson.
4004;This was not a great film, but it was worth watching as all involved were well cast.
4005;Entertaining comic book adaptation with excellent action sequences sure to provide some visceral enjoyment.
4006;Maguire does a good job as arachnid boy and surprisingly plays the stud aspect of Peter Parker well (and unsuprisingly plays the dorky part well too.)
4007;There are some other strong performances as well and Dafoe is excellent as the over the top Green Goblin (his sufboard is cool!)
4008;The old man who plays Gramps brought a tear to my eye!
4009;Raimi does a good job of giving the comic book aura to the movie and props to him for staying real to the comic book.
4010;This was an excellent adaptation of one the best super heros from the comics.
4011;I thought that Tobey McGuire was a great choice.
4012;He played the super rich scientist, turned villian/split personality with a style matched only by Jack Nicholson in Batman.
4013;the story was fairly true to the original story.
4014;The reality of the story is to believe that a human has spider like strength, stamina and heightened senses.
4015;but I do tell people this movie is worth the overprice of tickets.
4016;I will look forward to the next installment.
4017;I won't take up too much time with a movie review but let's face it.
4018;The special effects were amazing.
4019;The scenes where Spidey was swinging through the city were intense, exactly how it should be.
4020;The movie was casted perfectly . . . Tobey Maguire was the prefect Peter Parker/Spider.
4021;man, Kirsten Dunst the perfect MJ, Willem Defoe the perfect Green Goblin.
4022;The movie captured the Spider.
4023;The atmosphere was great, first day, everybody excited about the movie, and it lived up to the hype.
4024;Many of the scenes are hilarious because they're supposed to be funny and other scenes just got me laughing because I was giddy with excitement.
4025;The story almost becomes believable and with the incredible special effects it makes the movie the best adventure escapist film ever.
4026;But never mind my haggling, just go see the movie, it's definitely worth your money.
4027;I liked the movie and I think if not the best, one of the best comic adaptions ever made.
4028;The movie fulfiled my expectations, it certainly is one of the best comic hero movies out there.
4029;toby mcguire did a great job in it.
4030;i recommend this to any1 of u.
4031;I love the humor throughout this movie .
4032;man but still a good movie. . . . . . . . . .
4033;man is not quite as seasoned in the superhero folklore genre, but it has been a fascinating tale about an interesting character that I've followed along with my children over the years.
4034;the Superman and Batman series had some great character portrayals and exciting special effects.
4035;well, color me super surprised and totally flabbergasted.
4036;This talented group of people have done a superb job of replicating the action from the Stan Lee character.
4037;Tobey Maguire is a very believable Peter Parker and a super Spider.
4038;man, Willem Dafoe is superb in developing his character as always.
4039;Kirsten Dunst captures the charm and beauty of M J, and J. k Simmons is great as the cynical J J Jameson.
4040;The real credit for the stupendous success of this superhero character portrayal goes to the people behind the scenes that have created a masterpiece of fantasy that transcends reality.
4041;this is truly one of the most exciting and entertaining films of this decade.
4042;man several times and each time discover something new and amazing that previously escaped my scrutiny.
4043;there is certainly a lot more to tell of this tale.
4044;man fans out there who probably didn't like the changes in the movie but not being a huge fan myself, loved it.
4045;Sam Raimi is king and shows us why in both action, direction, and special effects.
4046;But it was very, but very entertaining!
4047;man is the best of all the super.
4048;They hit the key elements .
4049;Peter Parker's enchantment with Mary Jane Watson is handled well .
4050;age angst with the beautiful girl and rivals who are bigger, stronger, and richer.
4051;hero but this is definitely the best film.
4052;He's a brilliant young man, but is picked on and considered a 'geek' at school.
4053;He strives for the attention of the girl he has loved since 'before he even liked girls' (as he said in the film), Mary Jane Watson.
4054;The next morning he finds that he has amazing powers.
4055;He can leap higher than a normal man, he has incredible strength, he can climb walls like a spider, he can spin webs from his wrists, he has amazing reflexes, amazing speed and balance, and a 'spider sense' that warns him of danger before it happens.
4056;At first he uses his powers to achieve his own personal gain, but when tragedy strikes he learns that with great power must come great responsibility, and he decides to use his powers to help people.
4057;this film is truly incredible from the opening credits to the ending credits.
4058;Both kids and adults will love this film.
4059;amazing, I couldn't even tell what was real and what wasn't in terms of CGI.
4060;And in my final sentence I'd like to say.
4061;This movie has awesome special effects a great villian, and enough action for any 2 movies.
4062;tobey McGuire does a great job as Peter Parker and spidey.
4063;Willem Dafoe is excellent as the Goblin.
4064;I am more of a Batman kind of person and felt it was going to be tough to top those movies until Spiderman came along.
4065;While the acting was good and story decent, the story should have been dark the whole way through which is what makes good superhero movies.
4066;It is simply amazing to me that this film has been as successful as it has.
4067;hero films, namely Superman and Batman, and is not nearly as convincing.
4068;This gives him all the powers of the spider, including being able to shoot webs, jump from building to building and the power of Spidey Sense.
4069;It is based off of the comic book Amazing Spider.
4070;given how the Superman and Batman franchises had their movie debuts in the 80s, it's kind of amazing how the Spider Man comic book held off making a movie for this long.
4071;he did a fine job, however, as did the rest of the cast.
4072;pROS: Good acting, stays true to the comic book, Okay action scenes.
4073;cONS: Just okay action scenes, a bit long.
4074;time favorite comic book hero.
4075;Peter Parker looks like me,and I've always felt that I was him.
4076;He was the first comics character I felt I could relate to.
4077;man was everything I had hoped it would be:the best darn comic book movie ever made.
4078;man captured Spidey's actions perfectly.
4079;The fight scenes are choreographed well,evoking the fantastic and the brutal all at once.
4080;Any comics fan will be reminded of the immortal Death Of Gwen Stacy storyline during the chilling,final confrontation between hero and villain.
4081;Watching the film,you really get the impression that Spidey owns the Big Apple.
4082;man is as much a tribute to New York and its residents as well as the comic book form and Spidey himself.
4083;Maguire evokes Parker's quiet,shy,sensitive personality perhaps better than any other actor out there and balances it masterfully with cocky,devil.
4084;Dunst really tapped into the fun.
4085;like she did in the comics,but oh well).
4086;armor look that works pretty well in its own right.
4087;Defoe's portrayal of Norman Osborne's madness is frightening.
4088;The Goblin mask speaks to Osborne,and Osbourne speaks back to it.
4089;He makes Osborne seem sympathetic,and in a way,almost tragic in the tradition of the great Marvel comics villains.
4090;all of the other performances are great too.
4091;Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben is as loving as the comics character was,and Rosemary Harris turns Aunt May into the grandmother we all had or wish we had.
4092;man,and the music should have reflected this.
4093;Think about it,he defies authority,debuted in the early 60's(a turbulent time in American history),gets chased by cops,is misunderstood by elders,is full of bravado,is a smart.
4094;aleck,and is loved by the people.
4095;i have always loved heroes and heroism,fictional and otherwise.
4096;man is our folk hero,an American myth,our everyman,and I think is in everyone of us.
4097;man is a sometimes harrowing,but ultimately wonderful film.
4098;Everyone will find something to enjoy in it.
4099;We(meaning comics fans) really needed this movie to be excellent.
4100;i want to see a franchise.
4101;go out and see this movie.
4102;man is the best movie based on a comic book hero since 1978's Superman .
4103;That's not to knock the first two Batman flicks, but Sam Raimi's film based on the school geek turned crimefighter packs a greater punch of thrills and magic unlike anything I've seen in a while.
4104;man has a charming innocence that can make even grown adults believe in superheroes.
4105;But every hero has his nemesis, and in this film, Spider.
4106;The special effects are cool, but they take a backseat to the storyline and the cast which make up Spider.
4107;Give it a try and get yourself caught in the web.
4108;who does an awesome job of pulling it all together.
4109;production phase really helped develop the story too.
4110;this is the way to make a great comic book hero movie: treat the story as seriously as the characters in it would live it.
4111;the cast is wonderful (except I'm not that wild about Kirsten Dunst, she just isn't comic book babe material), the story keeps slinging along, and the cameos are fun.
4112;a great way to start a franchise!
4113;Sam Rami succeeded where generations of directors and endless, like.
4114;He found and inflamed the dormant desire for awe in admiration of the strong, yet tender, heroic male
4115;It is as fresh as a teenager movie and as action packed as any Hollywood blockbuster, while at the same time it is an excellent film in every respect.
4116;It is exciting, funny, touching and perfectly paced.
4117;In other words it is great adventure entertainment, and I highly recommend it.
4118;i do want to single out Alvin Sargent, a seasoned screenwriter, and his team, for writing a script that makes characters interesting, believable and sympathetic.
4119;The action is measured, the suspense is tolerable and the plot is interesting, tight and unburdensome.
4120;tobey Maguire, whose memorable performance in The Cider House Rules propelled him to super stardom, is the surprising and fortunate casting choice for the role of Peter Parker, the high school boy turned Spider.
4121;He gives a sensitive rendering of a young man who, having been bitten by a genetically modified spider, develops superhuman abilities.
4122;His portrayal of this dual, human and supernatural character is not only convincing, but given the actor's own likable personal traits, it is very sweet and moving as well.
4123;kirsten Dunst in the role of Mary Jane is as likeable as Maguire, and well cast as Spider.
4124;the villainous character's incarnation, in a subplot that involves the US Dept. of Defense, is unexpected, spectacular and amusing.
4125;man is inspired, and it includes a lot more than biologically re.
4126;This, and many other aspects of the movie will endear it to young viewers.
4127;man is a feast for the eyes.
4128;The producers' choice of locations, colors, special effects, costumes, and even make up, deliver a hint of comic.
4129;The hero's aerial acrobatics are, as one would expect, more fantastic than those of Olympic gymnasts, but delivered with the smooth interpretation and subtle touches of skillful choreography.
4130;Not worth the time it takes to view it.
4131;I've waited decades for this movie and it was worth the wait!Spider.
4132;man is the greatest comic book movie ever made!I'm going as far to say that it is as good as Superman 1&2 and Batman!!!
4133;I'm absolutely amazed by how well this movie has been made .
4134;full congratulations to everybody involved .
4135;The entire cast was perfect, the effects were awesome and the whole thing was just a perfect tribute to theclassic comic.
4136;The story is very good, Kirsten Dunst is the perfect pretty girl next door (Marie.
4137;jane, MJ), the fights and the special effects are great, the luxury arppatments beautiful .
4138;it is a perfect action movie, and a simple one too, so it seems to be intended for children as well as grownups (but there is sometimes quite a lot of violence and tension).
4139;The images are great, so is the soudtrack.
4140;That is not too serious though, because this movie is essentially an action movie, and there are plenty of excellent action scenes 
4141;One of the interesting points of the story is the fact that many people wandered if Spiderman was doing good or evil, in spite of all his good actions.
4142;Altogether, this movie is really enjoyable.
4143;My product came on time and it was great and also great movie.
4144;keep up the good work.
4145;The first Superman movie was cool, as was the first Batman flick, but both still had problems.
4146;As a Spiderman fan (okay, I guess I'm a bit biased), since a kid, I was wondering if they could do justice to this, probably the most truly interesting and unique superhero comic character ever created.
4147;This is a great movie and works excellently on almost all levels.
4148;Some can be quite entertaining, and some can contain excellent special effects and storylines.
4149;Just sit back and relax and enjoy.
4150;tobey Maguire is and was flawless casting.
4151;He brings the down to earth, nerdish.
4152;ness of Peter Parker, transformed in heroic times into a web slinging crime fighter, to the big screen perfectly.
4153;It was also nice to see Cliff Robertson, semi.
4154;there are two distinct stories here, one of Peter Parker's life, and then the special effects blockbuster scenes.
4155;popping and exciting action parts.
4156;fans of this general genre will find a LOT to love here.
4157;handed, dark type of Batman experience here, you won't find it.
4158;A five star triumph, and my thanks to those who made this, and made it so right.
4159;man i really don't see how episode 2 can top it as the summer's best film.
4160;i want a movie that has good special effect's but not overdone one that actually has a good story or one in spidermans case that sticks to the story of the comic book as close as possible and spiderman does this quite well.
4161;Toby Maguire is an excellent spider.
4162;man and one i think kids who will watch this film can relate to.
4163;He does an outstanding job as peter parker and spider.
4164;And who can forget the green goblin played by Willem Dafoe i must say they have the perfect cast for this picture.
4165;I want to also add that Sam Raimi is the director for this picture i had actually never heard of him before this picture but i really do feel after seeing this film you will be hearing alot about this man what a director WOW.
4166;This film is definately a must see 5 stars easy as for episode II we will see if it can compare with the nice suprises of spider.
4167;And that said, this follows: the movie was most thoroughly excellent.
4168;The exception is Willem Dafoe, who goes above and beyond the rest.
4169;He gets the play the insane bad guy, the Green Goblin, and he does the role with flamboyance, humor, and a perfect touch of drama.
4170;What I can say is Spider.
4171;The greatest asset is the interplay between them: Peter Parker and his best friend are in love with the same girl, the best friend's father sees Peter as more of a son then his own son, Peter and the father are friends on the surface and their alter.
4172;More so, the ending was very strong
4173;paced, exciting, and absolutely perfect for a movie like this.
4174;Now this still looks very cool, but the fighting between them could have been done a little better.
4175;Fortunately this is made up by them being fairly frequent and looking incredibly cool.
4176;The camera work is used to maximum effectiveness, racing after the masked man has he zips around the streets, slowing down during explosions, and generally adding to the limitless energy contained in the movie.
4177;man is great beating up four bad guys at once
4178;The movie also adds a touch of humor at just the right points, and a touch of drama at just the right others.
4179;And watching Peter evolve from a social outcast to a kid with a new toy to a new type of social outcast, one with responsibilities he cannot share, adds a very human depth to the film.
4180;man is a great movie, mixing action and drama in just the right levels.
4181;I'm not so sure that Tobey Maguire was the best actor for the role.
4182;Yes, that's right, the real heroes are ordinary people just like you and me.
4183;With the exception of course of the cheer.
4184;What kind of film has a geeky 17.
4185;As always, the real world, a great deal of which.
4186;pants looks, a kind of entertainment in which the overall idea seems to be that a young man should try to act his age and try to have some consideration for other people was yet even more welcome.
4187;Now I'm picking apart the whole genre.
4188;And maybe that's the best lesson of all.
4189;Got to seethe next one!
4190;some of the storytelling pauses in between the fight scenes were a little too long (my son started shifting around in his chair and so did other kids) but otherwise, it was a great movie and a recommended must.
4191;If you want something you can probably enjoy forever this is it.
4192;But this is for the big kids.
4193;The movie takes you right along with it, and I got tottally enveloped by the story.
4194;The effects were very good.
4195;On the levil with Star Wars, (better than the Phantom Menace) and the music was good.
4196;And that just gives you something to relate with this character from the very biggining.
4197;I just got wrapped up in the story, it's really great.
4198;I think you'll enjoy it.
4199;When I saw this movie the first day it came out, I thought it was really great.
4200;The acting is good, the storyline is good.
4201;Its one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen.
4202;It also includes an interview with the creator, Stan Lee.
4203;A great gift for the Spider.
4204;the prolouge is just outstanding.
4205;watch the movie and see what happens next.
4206;the Lossless Audio is great.
4207;man is a great action movie based on the comic book that has an excellent story to back up the action.
4208;This was a great superhero action movie with great fight scenes, especially the showdown between Spidey and the Green Goblin.
4209;man has an excellent cast whom all give excellent performances.
4210;The transformation he makes on screen from high school student to superhero is fully believable.
4211;Kirsten Dunst is perfect as all.
4212;In a very good supporting role, James Franco plays Peter's friend Harry.
4213;The movie also stars Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May.
4214;For a great superhero movie with a great story, impressive action scenes, and an even better cast, check out Spider.
4215;Spiderman (2002) is a refreshing flick that offers a little bit of everything in terms of action, romance, suspense, tragedy, and adventure.
4216;It has a simple yet very effective storyline that draws the viewer in from the beginning.
4217;busting action at its best, then this movie is for you.
4218;This movie also fully captures the essence of city life, and how a character like Spiderman can bring about a mysteriousness in the eyes of skeptical people as well as those who believe in what he's doing.
4219;I like the widescreen format, as well as the extras included.
4220;man was considered by many to be the best superhero movie ever made.
4221;It has since been surpassed by three films, one of which is its outstanding sequel, Spider.
4222;man is still amongst the very best superhero movies, though, behind X. men and in front of Superman.
4223;sam Raimi, who previously had directed only cult films (most of which were excellent), proves that he is more than capable of directing big.
4224;He does a great job of focusing on the adventure of the Spider.
4225;the cast is very good.
4226;Tobey Maguire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker, making him a very likable character, as well as one that we can feel for.
4227;top as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, while J. k. Simmons is perfectly cast as J. Jonah Jameson.
4228;danny Elfman's soundtrack is excellent.
4229;At times it's reminescent of his magnificent soundtrack for Tim Burton's Batman.
4230;The music really heightens the level of excitement for the movie.
4231;man is a fantastic, fun, and well.
4232;made superhero film, but it's also much more: it's a great movie.
4233;Thanks primarily to the directing of Sam Raimi, the acting of Tobey Maguire and a high.
4234;flying soundtrack by Danny Elfman, this is a film that can be watched again and again.
4235;From the guy who brought you The Evil Dead comes this high.
4236;The cast is great, the cinematography is fun, the music is adventurous, the writing is excellent, the directing perfect .
4237;it's just an awesome movie.
4238;From what I have seen of Spiderman comis this does do a good job staying true to the spirit of the comics.
4239;kirsten Dunst looks great as Mary Jane and Tobey Maguire does a great job as Peter Parker.
4240;if you are a fan of comics and comics turned movies this is a must see, otherwise it probably won't be worth seeing.
4241;This is a spectacular movie.
4242;The special effects are kind of cheesy, but it is still a good movie.
4243;This is a must see movie.
4244;You must see this today!
4245;Just see the darn movie, it's good!
4246;They did a great job makin this flick.
4247;Just saw the movie this weekend and I was really surprised at how good it turned out.
4248;The special effects were great and the storyline seemed to stay true to the Spiderman storyline.
4249;But the movie definetely surprised me.
4250;The ending even got a little intense too.
4251;Definetely check this movie out.
4252;It's well worth your .
4253;bucks to go see it in the theater.
4254;The Amazing Spiderman film is much more enjoyable.
4255;I actually prefer high bit.
4256;The story in this movie is pretty ho.
4257;hum, but pretty well done by the director.
4258;:pI recommend this edition if u have a decent 27 SDTV or 720p Plasma with an Up.
4259;this is my favourite of the 3 films, mainly because of the Green Goblin.
4260;And now, even if you own a multi.
4261;I just saw it today!
4262;But I found absolutely nothing to pick at.
4263;I particularly enjoyed the little things like the costume and the music.
4264;man apeals to kids and adults alike because he's just an average kid who's sent into extraordinary circumstances.
4265;He's a real guy with real problems.
4266;I recomend this film to everyone who likes spider.
4267;It was a very powerful movie.
4268;All things considered, I really recommend that you see this movie.
4269;man (2002) is an impressive technical achievement, as well as an entertaining, straight ahead action film.
4270;Director Sam Raimi's interpretation of the vanguard of Marvel Comics, while a pretty good thrill ride, is open to much discussion, as he reconfigures the Spider.
4271;man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Dikto, back in 1963, and has become an icon among comic book superheroes.
4272;man appeared in an animated series, that captured much of the basic essence of the character, and helped to boost his popularity.
4273;The short lived 1978 TV series, demonstrated that realistically translating the character to live action, would be a major technical challenge.
4274;The film takes the traditional route, starting at the beginning, with a retelling of the origin of the character, and after setting the stage, Act II focuses on Spider.
4275;The angst and inner conflict that Parker had in the early days (the first 100 issues of The Amazing Spider.
4276;Kirsten Dunst does a good job with the role as written.
4277;Peter is made to appear to be afraid of girls, but in the comics he was more preoccupied with other matters, and regarded as a 'square', rather than being afraid.
4278;It's too bad, because the Goblin maneuvers very well on his glider, and his pumpkin bombs are extremely stylish.
4279;The special effects do a good job of recreating the kind of radical movements Spidey is capable of.
4280;Peter's ability to create his own webbing, versus man made web shooters, is more in line with the DNA angle to his origin, and simplifies things for the filmmakers.
4281;man 2 (2004), which is a much better film, particularly from a technical standpoint, where both Spidey and Dr. Octopus, do some amazing things.
4282;sam Raimi definitely deserves a lot of credit for what he has achieved with the Spider.
4283;The films are spectacular, and very entertaining, and have forever lifted him from the ranks of cult horror films.
4284;With a history so long and rich, there will be issues regarding Spider.
4285;man's history in quite significant ways.
4286;raimi had great power in deciding what to do, but did he live up to the responsibility of doing justice to Spider.
4287;In the end, while the film successfully delivers Spider.
4288;this was a great movie.
4289;i mean this whole thing wasjust to cool to see.
4290;than this is good till 2/3 of the movie.
4291;what more cuold you ask for?so i'de say this was the best movie sinclod of the rings.
4292;The first show that started 9:10 a. m. was not a very happy experience for me, but it's good to see Sam Raimi regain his flair for rousing actions that has been laid aside since the 1990 Darkman.
4293;And I bet you do, even if you got a kiss from Mary Jane in the form of Kristen Dunst while you're hanging from up above, showing only your lips!Yes, Sam Raimi shows again his deft skill at mixing those incongruous elements .
4294;and he even throws unexpected comical moments into this hero's adventure, making his Peter Spider.
4295;But that's what Raimi's style all about, which curiously matches this unusual hero from Marvel Comic.
4296;beat presentation of this hero's life in America, and especially New York City.
4297;I was greatly amuzed to see the city depicted from a new perspective, that is of course, from high up above the city.
4298;supporting cast is also very good, and my special mention goes to ever.
4299;getting gorgeous Kirsten Dunst, whose eccentric beauty goes along well hand in hand with Tobey Maguire's oddly amusing, droll superhero image.
4300;man is a great achievement after all, which can be done only by first.
4301;It has something for everyone in the family: some action, cool effects, a little romance, and even a couple of moral messages.
4302;The movie stays fairly true to those origins.
4303;mAN is probably his best movie yet.
4304;the acting is extraordinary for a comic book movie and Tobey Maguire is right on the money as Peter Parker.
4305;Kristen Dunst is a great Mary Jane Watson, except when she and Maguire share romantic scenes.
4306;I was also impressed by the actor who played Harry Osborne, his portrayal was superb.
4307;overall a great movie that the entire family will probably enjoy.
4308;Other than that This movie is great.
4309;This has been a favorite in my library since I got it.
4310;Not only does it treat an american pop.
4311;culture icon with the respect that it deserves, it is one of the most well balanced action.
4312;adventure movies to come out in a long time.
4313;this is what happens when a fan gets a hold of the material and does it right.
4314;Sure there is action, but an action flick is just flash and explosion without strong characters behind it.
4315;Sam Raimi is the perfect choice for the film.
4316;His Hitchcock like style and tongue.
4317;cheek humor lends itself well to Spider.
4318;tobey MacGuire is also an ideal choice as Peter Parker, Spider.
4319;I loved Defoe's performance and see the reasoning why that the way that they did, but I was hoping for something a little bit more organic and less high.
4320;kirsten Dunst also does a good job as Mary Jane Watson, Peter Parkers love interest and I was surprised at the depth and maturity that went into the performance.
4321;The favorite feature of mine is the pop up option for the movie.
4322;up Videos just done with a feature film.
4323;The is also a commentary which is okay and you can also choose to have a spider icon option than, when it shows on the lower right of the screen, you press enter and a behind the scenes vignette shows up.
4324;There are two music videos, concept art, and an interview with Spider.
4325;believers, this is a great way to see why the wall crawler has such a widespread and loyal fan base.
4326;A film that you will feel compelled to watch over and over.
4327;the story line is ok.
4328;the best part of the movie are the incredible jump scenes where Spiderman hurtles himself through NYC.
4329;The fight scenes are also pretty neat.
4330;kind of reminiscent of The Matrix.
4331;This movie is a fun take from the comic book character.
4332;other than the issues above I really liked the movie.
4333;toby fits in very nicely in the role of Peter Parkar and our dear spidy.
4334;movie is full of cooool special effects with Spidy and the Green Goblin.
4335;I like action thrillers, and this was a sci.
4336;fi film, but the action was decent.
4337;If you like action films, pick up the widescreen edition of Spider.
4338;man was named the summer blockbuster for 2002 and it was a great movie and more than $400 million.
4339;if you want to see real action and adventure.
4340;see Lord of the Rings or Attack of the Clones.
4341;I'm being nice with my rating.
4342;Spiderman is an OK and entertaining enough film, but thats it really.
4343;The effects were the greatest part of the movie.
4344;There are far more superior comic book films out there.
4345;At first, I was horrified, but then I gradually came to accept the change as the price of greatness.
4346;enthusiasts, of my tale of Faustian woe.Your arachnoidal friend
4347;Hollywood did something right for once and Sam Raimi was the director to do it.
4348;tobey Macguire is perfect as Peter Parker.
4349;The action scenes are well done but the movie is at it's best while it shows Parker coming to grips with his powers while at the same time coming to grips with being a teen.
4350;Raimi stays true to the original Marvel storyline with great effect.
4351;william Defoe is very good as the Green Goblin.
4352;the absolute best supporting role is that of the newspaper editor played by J. k. Simmons.
4353;Cliff Robertson does a fine job as Parker's uncle and Kirsten Dunst is the love interest MJ.
4354;all in all this is a surprisingly entertaining flick.
4355;If you want to see a really good superhero.
4356;The first comic books, the cartoons, television, it has taken all this time to find the perfect director and cast, visuals and audios, to recreate the way it was.
4357;Well, first things first, the video and the sound are top notch.
4358;(4) Director SAM RAIMI's wonderfully hyperkinetic visual style, propelling the action forward while emphasizing the larger.
4359;life feel of a comic book.
4360;(1) J. k. SIMMONS' hilarious, scenery.
4361;Thanks for reading this, and see you at the movies!
4362;Tobey Maguire was perfect for Peter Parker.
4363;I enjoyed the interviews with the previous artists and writers of Spiderman.
4364;Also I really enjoyed the bio of composer Danny Elfman (one of my favorite musicians).
4365;If you enjoy comic book movies that are not as dark as Spawn, this will be a great addition for you.
4366;Superman was probably the best comic book adaption (although with some minor flaws) until X Men and Spiderman came along (I have to also give credit to Batman Returns and Blade.
4367;both were very good adaptions).
4368;Spiderman manages to recapture all the wonder I remember reading the comic when I was a kid.
4369;Screenwriter David Koepp (who worked on Jurassic Park among many another films) does a marvelous job of fleshing out Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's characters.
4370;What is most impressive is how the mythology is incorporated into an action story.
4371;We also see many of Spidey's exploits through a montage.
4372;the direction by comic devotee Sam Raimi fits in perfectly with the character and story.
4373;The direction is also informed with a love of comics which radiates throughout the picture creating much of the power of the film.
4374;Credit also goes to Raimi for not trying to mainstream Spidey and make him respectable.
4375;Although it lacks the impressive backstory of X. men (the motivation for Magneto is established very clearly in the film version and it has resonance beyond comics), Raimi more than makes up for it with a stunning series of visual set pieces.
4376;the visual effects with the CGI Spidey are pretty impressive.
4377;John Dykstra's (Star Wars, Star Trek: TMP) visuals are fluid and well integrated into the action.
4378;He plays the dual role with enough conviction and with a touch of madness where we can almost feel sympathetic for Osborn.
4379;The rest of the cast including Kristin Dunst as MJ are credible and seamlessly weave themselves into the fabric of the story.
4380;I also felt that the characters were well developed (J. K. Simmons as J. jonah Jamieson is a hoot.
4381;The screentests for Maguire (a great action sequence similar to the one where MJ is attacked by goons in the film)and Simmons reading Jameison's lines)are great.
4382;I would have loved to see more of the CGI screen tests (including earlier tests) but the single example included here is impressive.
4383;It's easy to see why the film got the greenlight given all of this.
4384;Definitely one of the top 10 films of the year.
4385;Anyone who's a fan of the comic books or has seen the cartoon will like this movie.
4386;It stays on track with the comics really well and the acting is superb.
4387;Great special effects and storyline, overall just a badass movie!
4388;One of the few times super.
4389;heroes are done by a directorwho knows the comics.
4390;man is the most realistic superhero.
4391;i expect an amazing movie and am happy that they did not pick Freddie Prinze Jr. or Brendan Fehr to play Spider.
4392;Tobey Maguire is the perfect choice to bring forth Spider.
4393;He'll show the depth that Spider.
4394;To add with the great special effects and what looks to be a great plot.
4395;she would have fit the puzzle perfectly.
4396;Anybody expecting a triumphant, Fellowship of the Rings.
4397;book superhero movie, Spiderman acquits itself quite well.
4398;In a smart casting move, the movie stars the legitimately geeky.
4399;looking Tobey Maguire in the title role as Peter Parker, the high.
4400;five years ago, where a hero perfect in body and soul takes out one.
4401;Befitting these more complex times, Spiderman presents a more complex version of the superhero, a young man with special powers who has to make the difficult decisions about how to use them.
4402;Before he's murdered, Peter's uncle Ben tells him with great power comes great responsibility, and Peter carries that weight with him the rest of the movie.
4403;He has to think about how his superhero role effects those close to him, and his decisions aren't easy.
4404;dimensional character, with a split personality caused by his performance enhancers, and the movie lets us see the conflict between his good and bad sides.
4405;The pacing is excellent, with action scenes nicely interspersed into the drama, but the action sequences themselves leave a bit to be desired.
4406;I found the grittier look of Michael Keaton's Batman to be far more effective, and I don't really like the direction these special.
4407;effects extravaganzas are moving in now.
4408;that said, Spiderman is still a pretty good movie.
4409;It's a lot more intelligent and ambitious than I had expected, and for thatalone it should get at least three stars.
4410;It also has an absolutely terrific ending, not the mega.
4411;happy conclusion I was expecting, so it gets an extra star tacked on.
4412;If there are more installments of this series, and this one's huge grosses all but guarantee there will be, I hope they live up to this one.
4413;it was outstanding the way they played out the interaction between these two long time enemies.
4414;You will love it as much as I did.
4415;The 24 frames per second (make sure your TV can accept those signals) makes a difference.
4416;Faces and clothing look very crisp and detailed.
4417;That's rare for a Blu.
4418;You can still get good sound with Dolby Digital on most Blu.
4419;the movie itself is one of my favorites, since I can relate to Peter feeling nerdy, shy and awkward.
4420;They did a great job of developing the characters before jumping into any heavy action (which comes mostly toward the end).
4421;With the recent resurgence of comic book popularity, it seemed only a matter of time before Marvel's classic heroes got their movies, just as DC's did.
4422;First came the spectacular blockbuster X. men.
4423;After that rousing success, who could doubt that Spider.
4424;The actors are competent, but with the possible exception of Defoe as Norman Osborne and the man who plays Jameson, none are outstanding.
4425;The visuals are sweet, but again, no surprises.
4426;Great movie and followed the comics quite well.
4427;I missed it when it was at the cinemas, and many people said it was worth seeing.
4428;And to top it off, full of digital effects.
4429;The only reason it has done so well is because it's a childrens film.
4430;Kirsten Dunst is miscast in this film, by the way.
4431;This version of the movie was refreshing, thank god for C. g. i yes!
4432;Kirsten dunst says Sam is good and Sam Raimi says Kirsten is good and they both laugh!
4433;it's approx 25 minutes but worth to all of the contents of disc 2!
4434;ray edition but i love this gift set.
4435;i think it's best you have blu.
4436;Spider Man is a great movie because it tells that he can jump from a tower to another and showes you how strong his web is.
4437;Though the movie is not that much entertaining, it speaks about more technology and visual effects.
4438;The movie itself is great.
4439;It is totally worth the extra money!
4440;The message from Ben to Peter in the care 'with great power comes great responsibility' is an axiom.
4441;The movie with all of the action has a dare I say 'moral' message that all of us need to hear.
4442;Just get the movie and you will see.
4443;I thought this movie had a great balance of action, romance, character.
4444;There was a wonderful unfolding of innocence blossoming into awareness without the mood ever becoming corny.
4445;You may want to keep the kiddies away from all the violence and occasional swearing, but it is overall a great movie.
4446;Staying true to the comics, this Spiderman film is due for two more sequals while the comics keep coming out.
4447;Spiderman and his friends become intertwined into this incredible storyline of betrayal, suspense, and .
4448;If you want to see a good film, see SPIDER.
4449;mAN, if you want to see a great film, see INSOMNIA.
4450;mAN is good film not because it's missing things, but because there are things that could have been added to make a great film.
4451;mAN is about Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire), he's pretty much the school nerd, he's also an orphan who lives with his aunt and Uncle Ben.
4452;amongst the group of kids is the most popular and beautiful girl he has met(Kirsten Dunst).
4453;mAN is a good movie at the fullest, but not a great movie.
4454;mAN is a blockbuster, not an Academy Award.
