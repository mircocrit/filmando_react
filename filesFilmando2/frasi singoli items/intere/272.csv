id;spiegazione
1;Saw is a great horror flick with a great story.
2;overall I really do love this first saw film along with the last six, and I recommend it to any horror fan.
3;The ending is a big twist, but I won't spoil it, you'll have to watch it.
4;If you haven't watched it yet or at all defitently check it out!
5;I bought this movie and i thought it was awsome.
6;this movie is very suspensfull and had you at the edge of your seat from almost the start.
7;they had a good choice of characters and it toke them only 18 days to shoot it.
8;see if you can figure it out.
9;Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised.
10;It takes a little courage to start a film this way.
11;I do recommend Saw, simply because it has managed to do something very few films have accomplished.
12;budget, independant films that are sweeping the globe in massive success.
13;Solid film, very clever, I was pleasantly surprised.
14;Mine ended up leaking somehow and ended up ruining both disks and covering the entire thing.
15;This movie is SO GOOD.
16;This movie has a great cast, great action, plus VIOLENCE.
17;I've heard a great deal of people say this and that about Carey Elwes' performance in this film.
18;Overdoing it would be Jack Nicholson (Oscar winner)in the Shining.
19;the golden age of REMAKES, Saw was a brilliant whiff of originality.
20;Held back tears, and the look of someone who could vomit at any second.
21;I'll agree that the other actors in the film may have given a sub standard performance, but Elwes did a fantastic job of portraying a helpless man whose family was in mortal danger.
22;Saw with Cary Elwes and co. writer Leigh Whannell is so good, so creative, and so brilliant.
23;I thought this movie was gonna be stupid but to my surprise it's probably the most strongest horror film I have seen since Scream.
24;The camera tricks are cool and modern, the film has this great dark green color to it, as it does in the sequel Saw II (just as good as the orginial).
25;Make sure you watch for all the clues, Saw is the perfect horror flick, highly recommend it!
26;But every now and then, a movie comes along, takes me by surprise, and knees me in the groin.
27;From beginning to end, this movie is pure intensity.
28;The movie moves at a brisk pace.
29;The story, and more importantly, the characters are what's important here.
30;Easily the best horror flick to come out last year.
31;this movie is one of the creepiest and screwed up movies I have seen in a long time.
32;and there's a toy clown that actually MAKES the movie.
33;Watch this, you'll love it!!
34;Saw successfully accomplished this task.
35;While I will admit that it is nowhere close to toppling the popular Se7en, it did stand on its own two fee and provide some interesting thoughts about life and the choices we must make when placed into life.
36;What impressed me about Saw is that it revamped the age.
37;"That is what pushed this film from your average ""serial killer"" film to a wickedly delightful noir."
38;I guess what I am trying to say is that I agree with the critics out there that the acting wasn't great, but there was excitement and appreciation for their roles, and I have to give them credit for that.
39;outside of the acting, this film impressed me.
40;The originality of the story shocked me.
41;Saw was a very intelligent film that coupled gruesome scenes of violence with the apathy of human existence.
42;i am also extremely passionate about films that allow you to discuss the possibilities of the ending, middle, or even the beginning.
43;Any film that evokes conversation the moment is has finished, in my book, has done a great job.
44;Any film that makes it exciting and interactive deserves some respect in my book .
45;The deeply rooted themes of human life and our choices to praise what is handed before us are strong and not often argued in film.
46;Saw worked well as a whole, from the acting to the story, all the pieces put together brought a very enjoyable movie to the table, but if you look at them separately, you will not find the enjoyment, just random bits of chaos.
47;This is one of those rare movies that hooks you from the very beginning and holds you until the very end.
48;This movie stands alone by itself as a classic, and shows what lengths we will go to to survive.
49;If for some reason you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it.
50;the ending twist is beautiful!
51;This sure is the best horror film I have ever watched.
52;when the end titles appeared,I just stayed right there,still watching,amazed by the ending.
53;so grand is the revealance of the killer,that it will propably give you a reason to watch it for a second time,since by knowing the killer already,you will watch the movie in a whole new experience.
54;for the people who gave one star for this movie:stop wining like a dog, what is wrong with u people?this was a great movie and deserves every star.
55;these individuals have studied their betters carefully, combing through Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, and more obscure efforts like Deathtrap and Sleuth.
56;What drives all four of those better films is fantastic characters whose obsessions and peculiarities are fascinating.
57;"Which brings us to Jigsaw, the mastermind behind these devious ""hands."
58;"off"" killings, orchestrated so ingeniously."
59;year old boy and video games aren't violent enough for you, you will find something satisfying in Saw.
60;This move is really good.
61;With one of the most (if not THE most) unpredictable endings, Saw is an excellent film.
62;It is nice to actually see a scary movie that stands out from the crowd.
63;Really like this movie and the franchise.
64;It might have had a great concept, looked good via story boards, but the end result was just.
65;I am sure many of you like this film, and I am sure it has some good qualities.
66;"She ""regains"" her humanity or something to that effect."
67;awesome i ws expecting just a typical dumb horror movie but this was one of the best storylines iv ever seen ever and iv seen nearly every movie,great 10/10.
68;I was told by several people at work that this was the best horror movie that they had seen in a long while.
69;Based on their opinions, I went and bought the special edition.
70;After viewing 'Saw' I came to the conclusion that it was one of the silliest movies, horror or otherwise, that I had seen in quite some time.
71;Also there were several unintentionally funny scenes in the movie.
72;"I would recommend this movie to anyone who truly loves a good psycho thriller
73;Overall this is a good horror movie.
74;overall this movie is enjoyable to watch and is recommended if you like serial killer movies.
75;the beauty of this movie is in its simplicity.
76;His basic M. o. is that he puts them in situations, often with medieval.
77;liners(""""This is the most fun I've had without lubricant!"""")"""
78;, and the acting in some places is hilariously abysmal(Like when Adam pretends to die).
79;all in all, this is one creepy and fascinating movie.
80;The most enjoyable aspect of it is discovering more and more facts about the two main characters as the movie progresses, and discovering the connection they have while watching them learn to cope and work with each other.
81;While not perfect, it's certainly entertaining and worthwhile.
82;(big time spoiler) This is one of those movies that you hear everybody calling it the best horror movie in the long time, but actually suck.
83;I had high expectations about this movie.
84;The rest of this review contains spoilers.
85;The bad guy is terminal and in the hospital but he is perfectly fine when it comes to building the face.
86;"For my part, it was quite an impulsive move to view ""Saw""."
87;although I can only give the film 4 stars, I can recommend it to all viewers of crime thrillers.
88;That point aside, the film was truly chilling.
89;"despite my misgivings about the plot, ""Saw"" is excellent drama that will keep all viewers on the edge of their seats."
90;When `Saw' was first released it took the nation by storm.
91;The original film was unique and thought provoking.
92;Saw is gritty, real, disturbing and most importantly stimulating.
93;as far as acting is concerned, this is far from a showcase that's for sure.
94;In fact this is one of the only films that have kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.
95;It has been compared to `Se7en', which is a nice compliment (`Se7en' is the better film), but `Saw' really is a film all its own.
96;If you think the trailers were good, this film is fantastic.
97;This is a true modern day thrill ride, and edge of your seat experience that will leave you watching you back for weeks to come!
98;I really believe this will be considered a classic in the future, it has spawned a whole new genre of horror (The Devil's Rejects, Hostel, High Tension, etc.) and it is the new thing that horror movies aspire to be.
99;budget and sometimes asinine genre, it has stood out and become a brilliant film.
100;"It would be described best as ""ingeniously evil"" and I would recommend this movie to anyone over 12 years old."
101;Really good movie, a must watch if you like suspenseful movies and surprise endings.
102;It'll keep you guess till the very end a good set of actors.
103;Saw is one of my all time favorites.
104;Its been a long time since a good mystery movie came out.
105;The characters were interesting and made you think.
106;The ending will always be remembered as a huge twist that no one saw coming.
107;I really loved this movie, very intelligent and clever.
108;The premise of their incarceration is simple.
109;Whannel as an actor is believable enough and probably a level better than as a writer.
110;Horror films should really try to stay simple.
111;inducing scenes in the beginning, middle and end chapters to make the film worthwhile to fans of R. rated horror.
112;He's not on par with Hannibal Lector, but he has that potential to be one of the classic cinematic villains.
113;in the end, Saw was a good enough horror movie for fans of the genre.
114;The ending of Saw seems well.
115;And the final shock is actually pretty good.
116;Better than other horror films that have come out recently though.
117;This is one of the BEST movies i've ever seen.
118;Not perfect, but still a nifty little movie with a clever premise and a few good scares.
119;"The opening of the movie is wonderful
120;All in all, though, the movie zips along at a good pace and rates high on the """"creepy"""" meter."""
121;The plot twists and surprises are devious and hair.
122;raising, and even if there are a few unanswered questions at the end of the film, Saw still provides a good scary thrill ride.
123;This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer.
124;"The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller
125;SAW introduced a new kind of horror to the movie.
126;in nonlinear fashion, SAW tells the tale of one Dr. Lawrence Gordon (well.
127;played in an understated performance by Cary Elwes), whose character we are introduced to at the start.
128;flashback scenes reveal that Jigsaw plays games with his victims, compelling them to make life.
129;The lead cop in the investigation of this unique serial killer is Detective Tapp (solid performance by Danny Glover, and of course he's used to playing a cop), and his partner is Det. Sing (convincingly played by Ken Leung).
130;the cops do actually catch somewhat of a break in one case, a rare one where one of Jigsaw's victims actually survived.
131;In the most keeper scene of the film, the viewer is treated to a firsthand account of the depth of Jigsaw's unapologetic menace in the form of Amanda (stellar performance by Shawnee Smith).
132;Smith's amazing performance (along with that VERY CREEPY doll!)
133;like presentation accentuates the film, which is told with so much style, confidence, and flair that it's hard to believe the shoestring budget with which it was actually made.
134;in addition to being wow.
135;ed by Smith's small part, the other actors do a good job of selling the film's most horrific moments in conveying genuine fear and terror.
136;They all acted how I would expect a person to act when they were on the verge of certain death!
137;director James Wan (who also developed the original story with Whannell) displays wonderful cinematic flourishes, with very colorful eye.
138;popping sets, great camera angles, quick jump.
139;pounding music at the perfect moments.
140;But SAW was really the first, and IMHO, still the best because it is more MENTAL, making one think """"What would you do?"""""""
141;The first time I watched SAW I loved it.
142;All I had seen before were trailers on television for all the sequels which just looked like a bunch of people stuck in not very well thought out traps that were just there to cause as much bloodshed as possible.
143;So, I loved the whole concept of SAW and its portrayal of people as the selfish egocentric people we are.
144;Saw plays with several genres including the detective story.
145;Some horror movies are fun because they are truly scary and entertaining.
146;But to be fair, when you consider that this was a low budget indy movie, its tremendous success is really impressive.
147;Yes, it's stylish enough (but sometimes the silly sped.
148;bottom line: worth a look for horror buffs, but overall nothing to scream about.
149;There is a complex story line.
150;this movie is confusing at sometimes but overall it is an okay movie.
151;ok, honestly, watching the previews for this movie didnt really imply that it was oscar worthy.
152;however, its actually a very good movie.
153;the acting isnt A+ at moments, but the story is actually very well written.
154;fans of the creepy crime dramas are sure to enjoy sAw.
155;hopefully the sequal is just as good, or better.
156;I just bought and watched this movie I received this weekend, was scary, suspense, and great movie, scrip was real good.
157;I gives a 5 stars, great ADUIO 6.1 DTS sound, really enjoyed it .
158;It achieves success in both areas, and is actually a good film that is not nearly as graphic as the trailers and the adverts might lead you to believe.
159;While hardly a great movie, it is good for it's genre, and should appeal to it's fans.
160;"We soon learn, well ahead of the main protagonists, that they are the victims of a serial killer known as ""Jigsaw"", known for his unusual MO of having his victims kill themselves somehow."
161;"Both men discover that they are in danger, and they must work together to find their way out, otherwise Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter will die, and they will rot in their ""prison""."
162;While Saw borrows from more prominent serial killer movies, especially Seven, it does have some unique twists and clever fright scenes.
163;Where this movie really succeeds is in the visual atmosphere.
164;While he is not known as great actor, he has done much better than this before.
165;despite it's shortcomings, Saw is an effective and compelling thriller that should satisfy most of it's audience.
166;The premise of the story, coupled with the notable plot twists, save this movie from being just another serial killer rehash, and I would recommend it based on that alone.
167;The audience did alot of laughing in this movie.
168;The ending was the best part of the movie.
169;All I can say is that I have now another favorite film director.
170;James Wan who seems to be a very young and fresh director brings amazing twists to this movie.
171;All I can say is I can hardly wait till I see his next master piece.
172;I was completely surprised by the movie.
173;The entire movie is done in a awesome camera work and cutscenes.
174;It is loaded with fresh and shocking ideas.
175;"I rate it right up there with Takashi Miike's ""Audition""."
176;lol) i was this at the movies and thought it was a great suspense thriller.
177;it will keep you captivated and on the edge of your seat till the end.
178;Hannibal Lecter is one of the best villians of all time, and while Jigsaw is good he still falls short of that title.
179;Elwes has that certain charm that Keanu Reeves has.
180;Saw is one of those movies that sucks you in, lets you get comfortable then smacks you right between the eyes.
181;SAW actually held my interest throughout, and genuinely shocked me at the end.
182;I sure do, and SAW made me feel that same wonderful mix of dread and amazement!
183;Just watch it and enjoy it.
184;`Saw' is a delightful movie to review, as it is such a mix of both good and poor qualities that it is a challenge to weigh them against one another to see what comes out ahead.
185;the first and most important positive for a horror film is the visceral reaction of the viewer.
186;So my score on this point is positive.
187;a second important positive for a horror film is the inventiveness of the threat.
188;`Halloween' scores big on this point with its creative minimalism of a psychopathic stalker with a blank, white mask.
189;My favorite example from A list movies is the nature of the threat in `Alien'.
190;The object lesson here is to be sure to hire a great graphic artist when you design your monsters.
191;There is a strong similarity between the fate of the victims in `Saw' and the way in which the murders are done in `Seven'.
192;I must also say that most of the perils created by the perp win points for originality.
193;the biggest question for the audience is for how long does the filmmaker maintain the suspense for the viewer?
194;The cops also introduce scenes from past perp scenes that fill out the way in that our perp works and thinks.
195;the movie does not live up to its hype, but it is worth a good chill.
196;for the horror fan, though, I'm sure this film will be coveted and hailed as a great film of 2004.
197;I am normally very good at predicting the ending of a movie.
198;This one had me shocked and surprised at the end.
199;This film is loaded with suspense and intensity.
200;If you haven't seen this, I highly recommend it.
201;Watched SAW again after a few years and the twists, turns and shocks still yet me.
202;SAW has to be watched closely as every line is important to the plot as little bits of the JIGSAW puzzle fall into place in some of the biggest twists I've seen in a film.
203;so the film is great and the sets are disgusting.
204;The song is pretty awful but the video is cool.
205;There is also a short documentary which is pretty good.
206;Funny as that is the most memorable thing about the whole film, that opening scene.
207;It's all in the game!
208;This is an interesting point that I wish had been given more attention.
209;sAW is a gripping, suspenseful and unpredictable thriller while it's running.
210;I'm willing to overlook it in this case because I was thoroughly entertained for the duration.
211;It is fairly interesting and often funny.
212;one rated and one unrated.
213;The rated one is actually better.
214;I'm being completely honest in everything I say here.
215;I've seen some exceptionally wonderful films in that genre, including One Hour Photo.
216;All the SAW movies are suspenseful and gory.
217;After seeing his partner be murdered, quite brilliantly I might add, he becomes obsessed with finding who the killer is even after being discharged.
218;That's all I will say about his character.
219;The plot is about as good as you get in this day.
220;But this movie is executed very well.
221;It keeps you guessing throughout, even when you think you have everything figured out.
222;The deaths featured in the film are gruesome and extremely raw, a nice visual compared to other movies' deaths.
223;This movie also contains one of the best endings to a psychological/horror movie I have seen, you're jaw will be on the floor.
224;Overall this movie is very enjoyable and doesn't stoop to the cheap scares as you might expect.
225;There's not enough movies with that aspect to it anymore, so for that alone, this movie is worth it.
226;Worthy acting and a great plot only makes this movie better.
227;For most of the film the terror and dread is psychological in nature and proceeds from an intelligent storyline and a thought.
228;While his actions are indeed horrific and grotesque his reasoning comes across as rational, his goals subtle and his attention to detail flawless.
229;"A great many people, it would appear, hold the film ""Saw"" in high regard."
230;the concept of two people struggling to solve the puzzle of why they were abducted and squared away together with the threat of death looming over their heads could, and should, have been handled with far greater care and intelligence.
231;Key points in the film offer golden opportunities for Glover's character to end Jigsaw's murderous campaign.
232;Saw does have a good concept, like I said.
233;"Saw is by far the best of the 3 ""Saw"" movies."
234;It has suspense, was very unpredictable, and had creative murder sequences.
235;I expected to be entertained, frightened, and disturbed by this film.
236;That makes one of us, at least.
237;For a really good mystery the viewer should be given the chance of figuring out the mystery as the story developes.
238;If you want an excellent mystery/plot.
239;Saw did have some decent gore/bloody scenes worth checking out.
240;i was truly surprised that this movie was a more creative kind of horror than what the previews seem to show us.
241;It's an interesting and nicely created horror film.
242;perfect thank you very much.
243;all good with order, shipping, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. perfect thank you very much.
244;all good with order, shipping, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.
245;If you do the task sucessfully, you earn your life.
246;The reason behind these awful games is to teach the meaning and value of life.
247;The saws aren't used and too weak to cut their shackles off their feet but has the ability to cut flesh.
248;His 'fight for survival' games are nail bitting and smart.
249;Blood, and guts are kept to their medium.
250;There are no pathetic and over.
251;saw is a very smart Horror movie.
252;James wan is (evily) inventive with jigsaw's death games.
253;He makes us experience the horror but also the emotion towards this.
254;but in summary, its a great film.
255;"one"" horror/thriller film premise should find much pleasure in ""Saw."""
256;"go, ""Saw"" is a disturbing game of master and servant as ""the Jigsaw Killer"" rounds."
257;This is an extraordinarily unique movie and should be treated as a morbid look at the human condition in times of stress and life/death.
258;As well, the creepy games (like the one Mr. Suicide played above) that the victims must play in order to live are creative and compelling.
259;"fans of Rockstar Games' ""Manhunt"" should enjoy ""Saw"" immensely, by the way."
260;This is one of those movies that is truly thought out.
261;And this is also one of those movies that will throw you a loop at the end.
262;i went into the theater with low expectations and came out with a smile on my face!
263;I always seem to disagree with the great concensus when it comes to movies.
264;If everybody hates it, I usually love it.
265;I thought Saw was a very good movie.
266;I admit, it could've been done better, and at times, it kinda ran on, but overall, I really liked it.
267;Saw is really the scariest movie of the year.
268;i personally think it's really smart and original, and the special effects are awesome!
269;But, actually, I do have one complain about it: I think it's very strong, and some scenes it has are very strong and I think they could disturb some people's minds.
270;Frankly I prefer Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers to this one.
271;The best thing about Saw is its premise.
272;one positive about the movie is the competent direction of James Wan, who shows that he knows a thing or two about atmospherics.
273;But plot wise I'd compare it closer to `Usual Suspects.'
274;Key words, and objects that end up taking shape in some way.
275;the plot is also told via flashbacks by Lawrence.
276;this is the first hour of `Saw' and it's great.
277;Chilling, well acted, and most importantly keeps you on the edge of your seat dying to know what will happen next.
278;"I just saw ""SAW"", the brilliant psychological horror film from director James Wan."
279;"They are a piece in the ""Jigsaw"" puzzle."
280;Saw succeeds on almost every level.
281;It is gruesome, tense, and atmospherically terrifying.
282;This is straight suspense, and everything you think is something IS something.
283;played out, I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed it.
284;the plot twists are numerous, and for once, they are significantly shocking.
285;"for a foray into the truly terrifying and morbidly uncomforting world of film, ""Saw"" is a must."
286;This movie will keep you out of your SKIN for a few years.
287;"And the brilliant ""Saw"" only furthers this point."
288;Sleep tight, and hope you wake up where you went to sleep the next morning.
289;It is polution to your mind to watch this.
290;One of the best endings ever.
291;A haunting thriler with many twists and turns, as well as a rich character study about the nature of sin, redemption, voyeurism and the inhumanity that we all are guilty of just by going through our everyday lives mindlessly.
292;The movie starts out kinda good (first 1/2 hour).
293;its not even worth 1 star.
294;but I am going to give it a star, not as a horror movie but a comedic attempt at a horror movie, some of the scenes are friggin hillarious in retrospect, recommended for a good laugh.
295;This was a great performence, shocking, thrilling, touture, enjoyment i really enjoyed it.
296;I liked all the saws but part3 was not that good but theothers were, so this was a great movie.
297;Saw is a good movie.
298;It's suspenseful, gory, and keeps your attention.
299;Be that as it may, it no doubt asserts itself as a rather memorable movie nonetheless.
300;while not great by any stretch, Saw is most definitely worth a look for those who enjoy Seven and the like.
301;I will say that this movie was brilliant.
302;Aside from subpar acting performances, this movie was excellent.
303;"It's a look inside the mind of a psychopathic killer who believes they've got it all figured out and is trying to prove a point through these ""situations"" he is putting people in, who, in turn are to attempt the save their own lives by doing something quite desperate and abnormal."
304;The story really keeps you thinking, and you stay on the edge throughout the movie.
305;He makes you believe that you've got it all figured out (on a few occasions), and everything is coming together just like you predicted, and BAM, the ending throws it all right back in your face.
306;"All I could do at the end of this movie was smile and say ""Bravo"" and give it a good clap."
307;There was something else I thought was strange but effective.
308;Give it a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
309;Very well done, minus the casting.
310;It has excellent acting, and the soundtrack is perfect for the style and tone of the whole movie.
311;"It seems there is a serial killer on the loose, but this killer does not technically do any killing himself
312;director James Wan has infused the film with a lot of style, using washed.
313;out colors and quick edits to give it a gritty look and keep the suspense factor high.
314;He also succeeds in using psychological suspense rather than monsters and one.
315;It is ample, I will tell you that.
316;Very deserving of a franchise.
317;It's sort of my new """"gem""""."""
318;Really great film all a round.
319;Easily one of my favorites of last year.
320;Saw definitely delivers on all the horror/suspense levels.
321;, but still easy to follow and still an excellent film.
322;This is the best of the Saw movies by a long chalk.
323;It's gripping and twisted, with some great shocks in it and a very good hold on the viewer.
324;It's gory and it's got some very good surprises in it, as well as setting the audience up for one surprise after another.
325;but, overall, the strengths of the story far outweigh the weaknesses, and it's a really nice addition to the thriller genre.
326;In this bone chilling, nerve wracking, and nail biting thriller, two men awake in a disgusting and rotting public bathroom unaware of why they are there.
327;This movie brings a new name to horror, and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout!
328;But in the end it's a pretty satisfying film if you let it.
329;The unrated adds some extra footage but I honestly couldn't figure out where the new stuff was.
330;"But all the clues and hidden things are clever but like I said, some are kind of like ""well he figured that out pretty quickly""."
331;like the other big Sundance film Blair Witch Project, it's a film that seemed refreshing and well.
332;This by far is the BEST movie I had seen in recent years.
333;This one will keep you on the edge of your seat.
334;Its A Great Movie With A Twisted Ending!!!
335;the movie opens, oddly enough, in my bathroom, or, at least a very good facsimile.
336;I was a little disappointed that Glover and Potter's roles weren't more substantial, but the upside was the story moved at a brisk pace.
337;The movie had a really strong opening, and kept me interested throughout, although it did sort of peter out as it went along.
338;Not really, but it was tense, unsettling, and definitely creepy.
339;In the end, looking at the film for what it is, an inexpensive (under 2 mil, I think), quickly shot (18 days), glossy initial outing, I'd say it turned out very well, and is worth checking out for a few thrills.
340;the anamorphic widescreen print looks great, with matching audio.
341;"This was wonderfully original (with the one esception of Se7en, which also was wonderfully original, and therefore makes this one wonderfully original as wee) The acting wasn't bad, and the score was excellent (thanks to the brilliance of NIN's Charlie Clouser) and the ""reverse beartrap"", while over."
342;All in all, it was a pretty good movie, at least spend the $3 to rebt it.
343;It's a really freaky movie!
344;It's all about what all you'd do to spare your life.
345;This is definately one of those movies you'll have to watch a few times to fully understand what exactly is going on.
346;This movie will take you on a ride and leaves a great opening for a sequel I am very exciting about seeing.
347;If you are a fan or Horror movies, then this is for you.
348;It's more of a thriller type of movie that keeps you glued to the screen the whole time.
349;One of my favorite Horror movies of all time with a twist you will never forget!
350;For that alone, it deserves credit.
351;"This film has no lack of possibilities as to who could be the ""Jigsaw Killer,"" and it really does keep you guessing until the end."
352;as for the ending, it's definitely interesting.
353;Overall, this is a good film, one that I'd recommend even to those who aren't always enamored of horror.
354;this is truely one of my new very favorite films!
355;I absolutely adore scary movies.
356;I enjoy the psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the absolute end.
357;well, you think you do.
358;the ending is definitely not what you expect and it leaves you wanting more.
359;You will be kept guessing until the absolute very last moment.
360;If you enjoy a psychological thrill ride, you will enjoy this.
361;I loved Cary Elwes in this movie.
362;"Plus, it has the cute Cary Elwes of ""The Princess Bride"" one of my favorite movies."
363;It's very, very plot driven, with a story that will have you on the edge of you seat, screaming at the screen and droping your jaw at the ending.
364;This movie is realy very psychological, and I think any one who likes a good mystery will get a kick out of it.
365;lastly I have to mention the ending.
366;This is the type of movie that will leave you disturbed long after you watch it.
367;so by now EVERYONE knows the premise.
368;that's all I'm going to tell you.
369;It is truly an origional film with genuine scares and real backbone.
370;this is for you my friends.
371;wire, timing devices, the safe, the candles, etc.
372;And some of the material was so unique, like the contraption he strapped to the one woman's head, that they would have to be able to trace the origins.
373;I found it hard to believe he was actually concerned with his situation.
374;The freaky little mechanical doll was also a nice touch.
375;and the ending, well, let's just say.
376;i put this move on par with se7en.
377;it is a sick twisted and wonderful trip.
378;truly an awesome piece of cinema.
379;i think screenwriter Leigh Whannel (who plays adam, one of the trapped men) does a amazing job especially at the end.
380;Cary Elwes also chimes in a great performance especially at the end.
381;the cast is amazing and supports the story well and director James Wan has written a great psycodrama of a movie.
382;Cube was entertaining at best.
383;i loved it so mich i bought it.
384;Simply put, Saw is the best horror movie I've seen in years.
385;I want something new, something fresh, something bold, something ruthless in its execution, something that engages my intellect while assaulting my senses.
386;Saw fits the bill perfectly.
387;as Saw moves toward its gory denouement, it unleashes a number of great surprises, and the ending is well.
388;i. e., as surprising as the final revelations are, everything comes together in a heartbeat to make perfect sense.
389;"Our imaginative dark lord of sadism provides the two with some hidden clues and ""tools"" that do much to keep things really interesting."
390;budget film has far surpassed the best horror films Hollywood has to offer, proving once more that a strong and intelligent plot, not gore in and of itself, is the secret for succeeding in this darkest of genres.
391;Saw is truly a horror film for the ages, the first true horror masterpiece of the 21st century.
392;On the one hand, the premise is very cool.
393;It's a marvelous setup and the surprising conclusion is right on target and thrilling.
394;"He appears to be ""teaching"" his victims a moral lesson, but what that lesson is in his mind is completely obtuse."
395;Both SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS also have clever plot devices, deranged madmen, and the like.
396;The result is a much more engaging, interesting, and ultimately satisfying thriller.
397;It's definitely worth a look and will thrill anyone who loves this genre.
398;I haven't had the time yet to see the two sequels but the original SAW is really excellent.
399;Good actors, which is pretty rare in this kind of production, a smart screenplay that should please amateurs of whodunit and serial killers movies as well as hard.
400;by now, everyone knows the legendary set.
401;Saw is a brilliant little piece of terror, perfectly economical, remarkably efficient at terrorizing its audience.
402;I have never seen a film so entirely capable and competent at conjuring up a mood of isolation, of wicked machination, of brutal death, solely by its use of light and dark.
403;"For ""Saw"" is only slightly a serial killer movie: it tips its hat to ""Se7en"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"", but its dark, wicked, brutal art is born from far more truly from the monster movie."
404;director James Wan has pulled off what, by my lights, is the perfect horror movie: compactly edited, brutally effective, happy to spill blood in the service of its message, consumingly efficient and economic.
405;If there is a scarier device in cinema than a puppet rolled out on a tricycle to gibber in the dark, I have yet to see it.
406;the acting throughout is solid and compelling.
407;Elwes and Whannel carry their roles like champs, right down to the point where those rusty hacksaws become one.
408;way tickets to the bright land of Normalcy.
409;Danny Glover (Detective Tapp)pounds out the most engaging, riveting performance of his career, as a defrocked detective who can't let go.
410;This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
411;The ending was definitley surprising and I loved it.
412;The first was great and from what I've seen of the second it will be no less.
413;I was genuinely suprized at the end,that don't happen to me much.
414;Thats one of the main things I liked about this movie also it has some creative ideas on the whole genre.
415;That's why Seven and Identity are a couple of my more favorite movies.
416;i think this is a movie that will appeal to many people.
417;If you like horror, or if gore doesn't bother you, this movie has a great premise and some decent acting.
418;So, if you're like me and you enjoy movies that play with your mind and not your eyes, stay away from this movie.
419;If you're the kind of person that likes your mind and eyes being played with, you'll probably enjoy the movie.
420;"About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to ""Seven""."
421;Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is superb direction by James Wan.
422;Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well.
423;this movie has an original story to it.
424;and to top it all of it has the best and most suprising ending to it unlike most horror films.
425;Late starting to watch this series as I don't watch many horror movies, but this one was a fantastic movie to watch around Halloween.
426;So good it just cries out for a remake.
427;a**'d movie, my friend!SAW actually starts out promising enough.
428;I was so shocked and absorbed the first time I saw this film.
429;I actually jumped at a few times.
430;The characters and story were really good all the way through the spellbinding ending.
431;The actors are great in their roles especially Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, and newcomer Leigh Whannell (he also wrote the screenplay).
432;Saw is a tour de force and gives a new edge on a thriller.
433;SAW takes you on a wild andbrutally insane roller coaster extra.
434;vaganza that will keep you wonderingfrom beginning to end .
435;grade: Somewhere between a B+ and an A.
436;I thought this movie was genius!
437;This movie is very well packaged it has gore suspense and you will never ever ever figure out who the killer is.
438;This movie is brilliant and I can't wait until the second one comes out.
439;This is definitely a need to own movie for all of you Horror fans like me!
440;See saw, knock on the door.
441;After a good few minutes of normal psycho.
442;hysteria, they found a tape in their pockets.
443;Saw is, by far, one of the bloodiest films I've seen in a long time.
444;As a horror movie, this was amazing.
445;I kind of see this movie as a two.
446;i was giving this as a gift and the case looks like something was sat on it.
447;This was an awesome movie!
448;Bloody and creepy describes it best.
449;That was worth the price of admission alone.
450;At times there was good suspense and some scenes were scary .
451;When actors are getting older they must have a decent job.
452;"It is simple: look at what ""Lethal Weapon"" was."
453;Mel Gibson has really improved his roles.
454;this movie is gory, disturbing, and just plain fun.
455;Lots of plot twists that will make you keep guessing!
456;Here's hoping it will be watchable!!
457;This movie is so worth seeing and even owning.
458;The acting wasnt fantastic, but it kept you interested and was well done with the material, and the plot twists were awsome.
459;I was on the edge of my seat through at least 90 percent of the movie.
460;"So out of 5 stars I give ""SAW"" 5 stars, it is defiantly worth it!!!!"
461;From an admittedly gruesome but purely artistic viewpoint, this first Saw movie is the only 5 star and by far the best film of the series.
462;fetched and unlikely, but a good movie can ask you to believe the unbelievable, if it's well made.
463;But if that fantasy just so happens to include a little carnage and gratuitous violence to the point of inducing just the tiniest bit of innocent nausea, then grab a barf bag, smile and enjoy it!
464;Instead, I'll focus on what makes this a brilliant movie.
465;There is an actual premise to this movie, and an actual psychology as well.
466;But to imagine a nearly surrealistic vengeance in such an unlikely form of vigilanteism still holds a fascination for the average viewer with a typically human blood lust.
467;There are blatant real emotions, self.
468;preservation and testing of the human spirit in the extreme.
469;This movie stands alone as a work of art.
470;Parts 2.4 are good movies and a fun viewing experience, but this first movie keeps the human traps simple, more believable and less complex.
471;This is a great movie!
472;An inspired, gruesome work of grotesque art!
473;The acting here is solid, lead by a cast of pros including Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, and Monica Potter.
474;That little girl often shows up every other actor in the movie, and the cast is very strong besides.
475;Man this movie is the best movie ive seen so far.
476;its scary, its thrilling, its funny, its just plain awesome.
477;Personally, I can't say I am in love with this film because of the gritty nature, but it is still scary entertainment to an extent nonetheless.
478;It's certainly scary at times and packed with grit, but it also has a side of it that makes you think.
479;Kind of a mystery to be solved, and when the answer is revealed in the heightened climax, its quite rewarding cause no one could have ever seen it coming.
480;The story uses flashbacks and pieces them together like a puzzle up til the very end, and just when you thought you knew what the puzzle is going to look like, it turns out to be a whole other picture.
481;The traps in Saw also carry originality, putting people in near impossible situations to escape, but not impossible.
482;The cast is an interesting mix for a horror film.
483;Cary Elwes is also an interesting addition when I think back to his roles in Princess Bride and Men in Tights.
484;you see the actor's face and that's the role he was born for.
485;This is a great story with many twists and options to play with as a scriptwriter.
486;Will you make a drastic decision to save your life?
487;Saw starts out with a great premise but ends with the believable factor.
488;Hopefully the sequel will be better.
489;But worth viewing to find out who is the killer!
490;I thought this was a very good movie.
491;That is actually what kind of diminsihed the film's fun factor for me.
492;The whole theme about appreciating life, the cat and mouse intrigue were fine .
493;Some fine scary moments and supsense are guaranteed however.
494;Still, it can be a fun ride for thriller people.
495;Aside from all of the negative reviews, this movie is a stylish, suspense/thriller with a gory edge and a twisty turny plot which you wouldn't be able to guess, until it's revealed in the end.
496;Saw, starring Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover, and Cary Elwes is an intense roller coaster with twists and turns and hairpin curves.
497;the movie transcends beyond a classic horror/slasher flick to become a psychological suspense thriller.
498;It's a terrific movie that will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat!
499;This is the first of a very cool movie series!
500;This movie will keep you on your toes!
501;it got the hair on my arms to stand up.
502;It got my heart to beat faster.
503;A horror movie that stuns, shocks, captivates, and lures you to see its end.
504;This is a great story with some good and bad acting, but overall a good thrill.
505;I'm actually surprised they made part two.
506;"I love when movies like ""Saw"" are released simply because it gives a twist on todays film indistry."
507;This was director James Wan's debut and I must say I am right proud of this young man.
508;The movie is superb in every way except its acting.
509;But all in all you should find yourself guessing, sweating, breathing heavier, and wide eyed from first frame to the masterpiece of a twist.
510;"The best twist since ""The Sixth Sense"" no lie."
511;Saw is a great film and if only its acting was imrpoved this would limp away with an easy **** 4 stars.
512;Heck I'll be honest even when I went to the website [.]
513;Nevertheless, an entertaining movie, definitely worth the watch.
514;The one that is focused on here involved a saw, a gun, poison, and other such things.
515;She has to go across the room, and cut open a man's stomach to get a key that is inside him, to unlock the headgear, otherwise it'll open her month forever, and she only has sixty seconds to do it all.
516;As Lawrence and Adam try to figure out what is going on, they have to maintain the safety of his family, and also themselves.
517;Saw is a very disturbing movie, and it came out the perfect time.
518;"It is a much better Halloween treat than ""The Grudge,"" and this movie wasn't full of jump scenes."
519;It was full of human reaction to fear, and it was intense from the beginning to the end.
520;This is a very good movie, and I liked it.
521;Each alive man finds a cassette in their pocket and they listen to the message the killer left them.
522;He has about 8 hours to make his decision.
523;True horror film movie fanatics will be able to figure things out.
524;BUT at the end there is a twist, that even I did not expect.
525;the acting was alright, but come on this is a suspense thriller/horror flick.
526;How many of them really have great acting?
527;I believe horror flicks are great to see in theaters, it adds to the suspense.
528;Do I recommend this movie?
529;this is a psychological thriller and it's very good.
530;A cop stays a cop.
531;This movie was such a pleasant surprise!
532;I thought it was great as it put an new twist on the psycho killer/horror genre.
533;other than the killer has an imagination and the director of the film has an amazing way with visuals.
534;Whoever did the production design did an excellent job .
535;to ensure your own survival and/or that of your loved ones was something to ponder.
536;There are some great twists in the film and, for such a low.
537;it IS a good one!!
538;That would take a genius though.
539;Watch it daily and your life will suddenly take on previously unseen meaning.
540;I felt the acting was quite good also.
541;The premise of waking up and finding yourself chained up with no memory of how you got there kind of reminded me of Cube, which is another great film if you haven't seen it.
542;But I was truly stunned when the villain was finally revealed.
543;2004's SAW was and still is one of the best thrillers I've seen in quite a while.
544;time director, James Wan, along with first.
545;time writer, Leigh Whannel, have concocted a smart, stylish, edgy, and boldly twisted movie about a serial killer whose goal is to place people in life or death situations in order to gain an appreciation for life.
546;wan and Whannel crank up the suspense with only a couple scares, but they are surprising and well.
547;One can tell that these two men really believe in their debut.
548;some of the best scenes are the flashbacks of the killer's victims.
549;Well, though the movie is well.
550;made, original, and somewhat shocking, the acting, especially by its lead, Cary Elwes, is a bit campy and unbelieveable.
551;overall, this is a solid debut with plenty of jolts to keep your glued to your seat for just over an hour and a half.
552;It's disturbing, inventive, and for once, THE FINAL TWIST PAYS OFF BIG TIME!!!
553;time viewers will not be disappointed and will find it surprisingly simple.
554;It's a great one nonetheless, and in my opinion, worth checking out.
555;I look forward to their upcoming projects because of their style and bold approach to the genre.
556;This movie achieves success in both areas, and is actually a really good film that is not nearly as graphic as the trailers and the adverts might lead you to believe.
557;Without completely running the storyline I will say that Saw definitely has some unique twists and clever fright scenes.
558;Where this movie really succeeds is in the visual atmosphere.
559;Definitely a movie that I would watch in the dark.
560;despite any shortcomings that some may discuss, Saw is an effective and compelling thriller that should satisfy most of it's audience.
561;The premise of the story, coupled with the notable plot twists, save this movie from being just another serial killer rehash, and I would recommend it based on that alone.
562;I saw this movie a few years ago, and I remember it very well.
563;This is actually a very impressive thriller.
564;It contains lots of high tension, severe gore, and clever plot twists.
565;The actors have done splendid jobs, and the writing is crisp and not too complex.
566;Music is also fantastic, and the cinematography is to die for.
567;Seeing the posters for pt 2 everyday going to work got me intrigued.
568;This is an incredible film.
569;Intense visualization, good acting, good amount of gore in consideration of how much is censored now a days and finally something to make you think as well.
570;Jigsaw is definitely a killer worth the ranks of Jason, Freddy and Leatherface!
571;At the end of the movie, every single clue comes alive and We understand everything, which is why this has creativity, it is simple, the acting is great IMO, DR. Gordon is one of the best actors.
572;this is one of my top favorites for sure along with the A nightmare on Elm Street Series, and The Omen Series.
573;i was very impressed by how tight this film was and how the story unfolded, and the twists and turns.
574;I knew a bit about what the movie was about and found it to be very tense the entire flick.
575;But the story flowed smoothly, the editing was really well done.
576;The perfomances as a whole take away something from the proceedings as well.
577;Part of what the men are given to help them figure out how to escape are saws(get it?)
578;I heard this was a good film through some friends and considering it was the week of halloween I thought celebrate with a good scary movie.
579;This really played into the mind I figured out almost right away who the guy was but I really liked it any way.
580;In fact the point of the movie is to make you appreciate your life.
581;"Two men, Leigh Whannell and James Wan, obviously had a lot of time on their hands when creating the now breakthrough film that redefined what Horror really is
582;now, for a plot as simple as that, the creativity has room to grow and even to pulsate with ingenious gimmicks and clever plot twists.
583;Along the way, the film educates you on the one holding them hostage and his method of killing.
584;And, for a first try, debut film, these two filmakers really raise the bar higher than ever anticipated.
585;i highly reccomend this film if you are a hardcore horror/thriller fan but also want the thinking that goes along with it, as with the Movie Seven.
586;I positivly love this movie.
587;Put 2 and 2 together and you get thrills and chills the whole movie long!
588;All of this leads up to a incredible scary ending with a huge twist.You just have to ask yourself one question. """""""
589;Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell over acted so much that it seemed funny.
590;"production and I can only hope the casting director will step up and get some really good actors so we can all enjoy the ""Jigsaw Killer's"" next little game!"
591;This movie isn't as good as some past mind @%*% movies, but it definately is worth a look at.
592;"One of the 5 best horror films I've seen, ""Saw"" ranks with such classics as ""The Exorcist,"" ""Jaws,"" and ""Alien."""
593;The technique ensures that the viewer is always part of the action by setting up a tension that continues seamlessly to the final scene.
594;Whannel demonstrates his writing expertise by offering his viewers a story line that carries them on an emotive experience to keep them vacillating between fear and hope.
595;whannel's writing always maintains the mystery of his plot.
596;Wan supports the story through flashbacks and artful cinematography, making revelations that give the audience hope that they are on the verge of solving this entangled mystery.
597;The soundtrack is unobtrusive, yet it functions as an unconscious energy that keeps the viewer focused.
598;Together these two classic myths hint at Whannel's philosophical message about life.
599;But the collaboration of Wan and Whannel produced a 21st century horror classic that offers excellent writing, directing, cinematography, editing, and acting.
600;"It is a ""must experience."""
601;I will say that, aside from carey elwes and that other guy's performances (the photographer), this movie is really good and is actually pretty scary.
602;One of the best endings in a long time, too, maybe since the Sixth Sense, and it was nice to see Danny Glover in a creepy role for a change.
603;This another extraordinary film that did not due too well during its theatrical release, but I highly recommend.
604;I love films that stretch the imagination and develop new and exotic ways to tell an age old story, and this film does just that.
605;I have to say that this movie is superb and very refreshing when it comes to the horror genre.
606;The story and actors are so well done, you will be glued to the screen the entire time.
607;carey Elwes, Danny Glover and every other person does an excellent job in their roles and you feel for every single character and understand where they are coming from, even the Jigsaw Killer.
608;Yes, there is a twist in the film and I have to tell you, I never saw it coming.
609;Tobin Bell, the one who plays the villian of the film, said that the twist alone is the reason he likes the movie.
610;One of the more inventive, original, and creative (albeit gory) horror movies in years.
611;The thrilling suspense is also incredible.
612;I give it an A.
613;It's got frightful, intriguing ideas and interesting scenes and a strong, expressionistic (if derivative) visual style.
614;It may not all add up cleanly at the end, but the scenes are good enough that that doesn't really matter.
615;I like it a lot) Naturally, this sort of film is even more convoluted and unlikely that you typical thriller, and I suspect it's just a reflection of sloppy writing rather than same grand scheme, but it reveals the general aesthetic of both these types of films: scenes and ideas first, plot second.
616;As I said before, it is massively indebted to David Fincher's work, but that's a very good style.
617;The intense griminess and stylization of visuals also sets it apart from most thrillers, as it is taken to such a point that the world no longer seems even remotely real.
618;as I keep saying, this film has great scenes, even if they doesn't always make all that much sense.
619;Most notably, the whole setup is just great, I think.
620;Convoluted and highly, highly unlikely, but great.
621;And, the climax, while I cant go into specifics, is really very intense and grisly.
622;A very effective closing the the film.
623;despite what anyway may tell you, the acting in this film is perfectly serviceable.
624;Virtually everything else works quite well.
625;Yes, it is quite often gruesome, graphic, and disturbing, but it is all accredited to a very clever and darkly interesting premise.
626;writer Whannell and director James Wan, both newcomers, showcase a great confidence towards filmmaking, as Whannell's writing is very fluid and engrossing (I'm not saying he's David Mamet, but for someone not much older than college age he's very talented) and Wan's direction points toward a long future in filmmaking.
627;I can't tell you if the sequels are able to have a nice psychological thriller along with the blood and guts, but this one has it and more.
628;It promises to deliver tense moments and it does.
629;And this is somewhat in that vein .
630;a couple of guys who don't know each other wake up in a disgusting bathroom (I think it's the one that Ewan McGregor went toilet diving in Trainspotting.)
631;the acting is well above par for such a film.
632;The challenge of making a convincing film is greatest for horror than for any other genre.
633;"All of the cult classics, from ""The Hills Have Eyes"" to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Last house on the Left,"" the motif never veers too far from its basic premise: group of friends goes on adventurous excursion, enjoys a fleeting taste of freedom,innocence and exhiliration, and is then led terribly astray by unforeseen circumstances."
634;"Despite the success that motif has occasionally delivered over the years, ""Saw"" relies on a far more complicated and meticulous story brimming with fascinating details and psychological inquiry."
635;The film really does speak for itself.
636;Saw hardly belongs in that category, and was well worth the 6 bucks I coughed up to see it.
637;It was a great movie, though!
638;Obviously it's about this psycho and he has this puppet thingy.
639;Let me start out with a simple task for you.
640;It delivers in more ways than than you would imagine and will make even the most experienced horror veterans jump.
641;The Ring didn't scare me, nor do most movies, but this really got to me.
642;This will present a challenge for anybody who thinks they no whodunit and believe me, you will find yourself so immersed in your own suspicions, the ending will hit you like a brick wall.
643;I have seen a lot of stupid movies and i can be a pretty harsh critic, but I will recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good thrill.
644;And it succeeds, on many levels.
645;It now seems the good doctor and Adam are the latest players in the sicko's trail and how all this works out is a cat and mouse chase and pulse.
646;if you love SEVEN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL, and other grisly shows, you'll love this little movie.
647;And that is all you can ask from this genre!
648;I on the other hand thought that Saw had a great plot and a very stunning end.
649;This movie is very entertaining though and will keep you riveted the entire time.
650;"And these guys are getting the chance to make ""Saw 2?"""
651;This movie is absolutely pure genius!
652;The killer is brilliant and creative.
653;I'm a throwback when it comes to horror films.
654;Great spooky images (the clown), suspense throughout, twists and turns, creepy musical score which adds to the setting and one of the most unbelivable, unexpected endings ever.
655;A refreshing change and a diamond in the rough of newer horror films.
656;A fantastic film that should be added to any horror fans collection!
657;This is probably the best one of the series.
658;it's a very gory and realistic movie in terms of visuals.
659;It is a 100 minute film and just when your brain starts wondering what is going to happen next it hits with you two or three shocker moments.
660;I must add that the music in the film adds to the tension and strange feeling of admirable awe it arose in me.
661;What really matters is the unique storyline and the sickness behind a brain that wants to teach you a lesson by playing with your life.
662;This was without a doubt the best suspence movie since Seven.
663;It was filled with twists and turns that kept everyone guessing.
664;6/5 and I think I found a new favorite movie.
665;this is definitly one of the best suspense/horror films i have seen in a long time.
666;this is a great movie and i recommend for everyone to watch it, put it on for your friends,invite your family.
667;this movie is definitly going down in history as one of the best thought out films ever.
668;the gore is beautifully done.
669;Right up til' the end with the twist.
670;I'd definitely give it 5 stars and see it again.
671;A great thriller in every sense of the word!
672;I think the man is great.
673;the ideas in the movie were interesting.
674;A good, frightening movie is a movie that sticks with you after you've watched and makes you run over and over the details.
675;And that is exactly what Saw did.
676;SAW is one of the best movies of that genre that I've seen in a long time.
677;But most importantly, it makes you think and wonder about how things came about.
678;all your questions might not be answered but hey, it's a highly entertaining movie, with a super cool ending, in my opinion!
679;Saw is a horror movie released last year that certainly delivers.
680;It certainly has its faults as does every movie but it is a genius horror movie compared to the rest of them.
681;first off, most of what happens in the movie is effective.
682;the movie packs chills a plenty and some scenes will make you grossed out.
683;"For a horror movie, it's in the top 5 I've ever seen
684;the ending has a huge twist that was geniously conceived and worth the watch alone.
685;this movie is in my opinion better than all of the Hannibal movies.
686;Because this movie is very entertaining.
687;It is obvious that it was a low budget movie but this plot is genius.
688;The whole time, you're on the edge of your seat.
689;The ending is to me the best I've ever seen.
690;Look how genius it is.
691;Sure the Silence of the Lambs has better acting but really.
692;this movie is splendid and really entertaining.
693;I loved it and now own it because it's a one of kind movie regarded by most as your average horror flick but it's not.
694;it becomes an excellent movie.
695;a smart thriller with great thrills and twists that is worthy to add to your collection.
696;Because what you will find here if you look a little closer is a geniously thought out movie that is trully one of a kind.
697;Another reviewer made that statement, and gets the tone right in his review.
698;It wants to have the shock, and existential morality, and plot twists of """"Se7en,"""" but manages at best an ersatz echo of that masterpiece."""
699;What a difference one film can make that would eventually spawn a popular and successful franchise known as 'Saw'.
700;The film led you to believe who the killer was as the film went on until a huge twist hits you at the end.
701;The ending will always be remembered and the film overall is a gem.
702;Definitly a recommendation to any movie watcher of any genre.
703;Yes, there are some very graphic scenes captured on film here, however the story is one of the most original.
704;If you liked Cube and the originality and level of tone this is right up your alley.
705;The filmmakers assembled an excellent cast that completely sell the idea.
706;This is a good psychological horror film with some very graphic elements.
707;Capturing all of the beautiful yet dirty and grimey set design.
708;lionsgate has been one of the original supporters and most reliable makers of Blu Ray discs to date.
709;Their BR discs are consistently some of the finest available for picture and sound.
710;"Neither movie is ""pure"" horror, but are rather thriller."
711;it truly is a sick and shocking film, but I thought it very original and 'non' Hollywood which was very refreshing.
712;Of the 4 that went to see it with me, all thought it fantastic, 2 have been genuinely affected by it since.
713;The plot is nothing special, nor is the acting, but I have to say I enjoyed it.
714;This movie was a real mind trip to me!
715;I love these kinds of movies.
716;With all the CG **** out there now, this movie is a real treat!
717;It kept me interested, and I like the way it all unfolded.
718;I thought it was good.
719;I like these kind of movies and would recommend it to people who like mystery and stuffs.
720;The plotline and creative camera.
721;The subject matter is meant for mature minds.
722;This is the most impressive horror movie in a long time.
723;So this movie is really good (considering i went to see it with little hopes it would be this good).
724;love it or hate it, Saw is a major achievement for the fledgling writer/director pairing of Whannell and Wan.
725;i thought that would either be a really incredible plot twist or a SMASHING surprise ending.
726;There is a plot twist and a surprise ending, but it's only mildy entertaining.
727;What I did like about this movie was the incredibly twisted and wierd mind of this serial killer.
728;"It truly entertains for the ""Seven"" lovers in us."
729;There ARE better movies for those of us that enjoy this kind of thing, but it's worth giving Saw a watch if even for the sh.
730;This is in no way a bad film but I prefer Cube to this one as the Canadian thriller, based on the Cartesian/Kantian concept, has much more to offer both ethically as well as artistically.
731;This is a really cool movie.
732;"It's not just horror or just suspense
733;You know they dont deserve a good mark, but he/she is so darn fun and enjoyable, that you cheat yourself a bit.
734;this film has very good writing for the most part.
735;Expect some funny dialogue and interesting special effects, along with decent acting and slightly better direction.
736;But, the ending will make up for it.
737;overall, it's worth watching at least once.
738;this is a great horror flick despite what people's expectations are.
739;i go to see these movies for their shock value and that is why i give this movie five stars.
740;out clever surprise, but rather some guy just pulled out of the writer's buttocks .
741;This movie was not bad but it wasnet good either it's just there.
742;The film did have some disterbing and scary moments and the ending was pretty good.
743;i do love blood&guts so.
744;I mean a film that is pretty much responsible for a whole horror sub.
745;genre, has to have something going for it, right?
746;I was very pleasantly surprised!
747;Great acting, an intelligent script, great pacing and direction, and it was more than just a torture porn flick, it had redeeming qualities and characters.
748;It was actually closer to films like """"Silence of the Lambs"""" and """"Seven, and was the best film of that ilk since those great movies!"""
749;Though I'm not inspired to check out it's sequels, as most sequels get progressively worse, this is a film I'll watch many more times, and recommend!A cutting edge film!
750;When he awakens, he finds himself submerged into a water.
751;A third man has been killed and is lying on the floor.
752;"They must also find an ""X"" that marks the spot."
753;I was upset I payed full price to see this movie.
754;I love movies and usually really enjoy, and give credit to potential, but this had none in my eyes.
755;Thanks to Scary Movie IV, I decided to go ahead and check it out and I absolutely love this film.
756;"Nevertheless it is a very intelligent film and the ending will honestly make you say ""WOW""."
757;This movie is absolutely incredible.
758;I loved this movie so much that I went out about an hour after I watched this movie and bought it.
759;This movie will keep you guessing throught the movie.
760;Poking deeply inside human cruelty and suspense alone is not enough for me to rate this movie highly.
761;I think this movie is very interesting in two ways.
762;"secondly, everyone can be the ""jigsaw""."
763;Anything that i think might be damaging to your enjoyment of the movie is marked with the regular ###sThis film messes with your mind.
764;The more you learn the more you want to learn.
765;I found myself wringing my hands more than once.
766;###The mystery is actually quite simple.
767;But its SO simple that it ends up being quite complex.
768;I bought this uncut version with special features and it does not dissapiont.
769;It shows how saw came to be and how it was made and a look into the movie you wouldn't get with just watching it, it makes you appreciate the movie more.
770;i recommend to all old enough to enjoy this!
771;those he deems unappreciative of life .
772;into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.
773;I have just watched this movie for the first time and it is, as well, the first time I have watched a blu.
774;Saw is a Seven clone but without the heart, soul or intensity of the original psychological thriller.
775;saw has a great premise and spooky villian, that kept me watching all the way.
776;Saw promises a lot and almost makes good on it.
777;Saw got made because of the cringe.
778;inducing scenarios it offers, namely the various and unique machines and games this Nameless labotomy patient comes up with.
779;"tighter ending is very effective until they throw in one minor detail from the beginning that again categorizes as just repetitive, then you get that moment that'll make you disappointedly say, ""Ah, c'mon."
780;But it adds to the movie.
781;But what they added was cool.
782;I really like the movie SAW.
783;I liked the theater version.
784;So, seeing a version with a little extra was a bonus.
785;First off, Saw was brilliantly well done.
786;"For his first acting gig, Leigh Whannell actually did a good job, and he had some really funny lines to boot: ""All I know is that I fell asleep in my s**thole apartment, and I woke up in an actual s**thole""."
787;All you know is that something sadistic is taking place on screen, and you can do nothing but let the pieces slowly but surely fall into place.
788;I saw this movie with a friend of mine the other night and I have to admit I was really looking forward to it.
789;I was told that it was a bit gory but it had a good plot and the ending was good as well.
790;There is nothing happy or satisfying in this movie.
791;If you are looking for a good thriller, do not see saw!
792;Danny Glover puts in a good performance as the crazed and monomanical cop.
793;i give three stars, meaning above average, because it has entertainment value and some elements of cinematic art.
794;Every other day brought new photos, new links to trailers, new behind the scenes stories, and new conjectures all pointing to the incredible potential of this movie.
795;"They furthermore whispered words like ""giallo"" and ""Argento"" to describe the stylistic aspects of the movie."
796;Needless to say I wanted to see this picture in the worst way after reading such high praise: I love films larded with gory carnage, love gialli, and think Dario Argento is one of the great horror masters of the modern age.
797;"most of what we learn in ""Saw"" comes from flashbacks from Adam and Gordon."
798;We also discover that Gordon has a lot of family problems with his daughter and wife.
799;He helped me, claims Amanda, and it's disturbing to realize you understand exactly what she means.
800;"jigsaw's philosophy is one of only a large number of massively disturbing elements in ""Saw,"" but it's one of the more interesting ones."
801;"Nevertheless, ""Saw"" is definitely worth a watch
802;Will Lawrence kill Adam?This movie is very good.
803;The plot is brilliantly conceived, and the twists and turns are definitely the highlight of the film.
804;A lot of good background information is provided in the flashbacks expreienced by Dr. Gordon.
805;The ending of the film was totally unexpected, and it will leave you spellbound.
806;I highly recommend this movie.
807;The plot is extremely well conceived and the story is teriffic.
808;and was quite pleasantly surprised.
809;By no means a flawless film (typical aspects of Wan's directorial style I find offputting now and again), I would nonetheless say it is a very well done suspense.
810;(Of course, no one is likely to be surprised now, given the focus on Jigsaw or John Kramer in much of the rest of the series"
811;"the performances, given the nature of the film, are generally either quite creditable, or simply very good, depending
812;screen in an active capacity for a very short time, Tobin Bell does make a memorable impression.
813;This has been my all time favorite movie ever since it came out.
814;This was a good movie, but the second one totally kicks this ones ass.
815;There's a man with a gun and a tape recorder in the middle of the room, who appeared to be shot in the head.
816;If you like sick gory movies, this is a winner!
817;This is one of the most original ideas of seen in any movie recently.
818;The ending surprised me greatly.
819;My only complaint is that there's a lot of dialogue but though all that to see the violent scenes makes it worth your while.
820;some of the symbolism is unforgettable: the really deranged puppet the killer has popping up at crucial moments, and the Samurai.
821;this is a great awesome movie!!
822;is really a great thing, with lots of psychological games, you will love it!!
823;this is a great horror thriller.
824;it is one of the best horror flicks out there
825;this movie is pretty good if youi liked se7en.
826;all in all a pretty good flick worth your money
827;Ever since this movie came out, I have heard people talking about how good it is so I finally decided to watch it!
828;I am a big fan of this show/movie.
829;Then as it gets closer to the end I thought """"ok I get it now, that's why""""."""
830;The movie is entertaining through.
831;It starts out as a good mystery/horror film and becomes just laughably bad entertaining at the end.
832;Still it is a lot better than most recent horror films that came out recently.
833;and that is the scariest part of them all.
834;overall this is a movie i will cherish for the rest of my life.
835;They keep coming and I keep enjoying.
836;this should be made perfectly clear right from the start.
837;Keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end!!!
838;If your a fan of thriller/horror movies you will love it
839;The twists, the plot itself, the setting, the suspense, everything seemed to have been mapped out perfectly.
840;They kept the movie contemporary, but still managed to also keep it moving at a relatively easy pace, so you're able to keep up with what's going on while the suspence builds up on you.
841;That was a great credit on the director's part.
842;Saw is one of the best damn horror movies I have seen in a very long time.
843;Any true horror fan should enjoy it!
844;"The integrity of the cast and the filmmaking in the latter is far beyond ""Saw's"" range, aside from the fact that ""Seven"" came out some 10 years ago."
845;Now I finally understand the praise by critics and fans this film is getting!
846;well you get the idea!
847;this grim story is one that will pull you in and has a great twist at the end,just don't think about it to much!
848;I do recommend seeing it on the big screen, and if you take a date with you you can expect lots of arm squeezing and head ducking.
849;Come to think of it, that also might be worth another star.
850;Which is actually a pretty interesting idea, and this movie had tons of potential.
851;This is a decent movie to just sit around and watch with your friends, but dont expect anything oscar worthy.
852;This is fresh air in dying lungs.
853;"I do enjoy this one slightly more than ""Saw 2"" simply because I really enjoyed the plot, two guys chained to the bathroom."
854;There is the birth of the saw franchise.
855;Leigh Whannel (Writer, Adam) and James Wan (Writer, Director) did a wonderful job, writing a horror movie that wore their influences on their sleeve yet showed their own present imagination.
856;The great select of which the scenes were shot at alongside the haunting musical composing of Charlie C. really help add to the darkness of this film.
857;Even though, the plot has been discussed and picked at over again, I will do the same.
858;Throughout this film, we watch as Adam and Dr. Lawrence slowly stumble upon the sad truth as to watch has been done to them (and what could happen to them if they don't use their time wisely) and what could happen to their loved ones as well.
859;It is truly intense watching Dr. Lawrence slow spiral down the staircase of insanity as he finds of this outcome involving the murder of his wife and child.
860;In the end, it all comes down to one final gripping scene in which this all began.
861;this movie, means alot to me and is one of my all time favorites due to its message.
862;Jigsaw is a refreshing villian in a sense because he really isn't one.
863;this sums up the Saw franchise very well.
864;The direction by James Wan is very good as well as the script he wrote which is quite well written, this movie is an edge of your seat thrill ride that isn't for the faint of heart but for those brave enough to enjoy this movie.
865;There's plenty of twists and turns throughout this movie that includes one scary looking puppet that the killer uses to terrorize his victims, there's also a nice twist at the end of this movie.
866;Saw is the most disturbingly entertaining film of the year.
867;The films suspence will have you on the edge of your seat.
868;This film is totally unpredictable and will satisy you by the end of the film.
869;If you love horror and mystery this is the film to go see.
870;Greatest thriller movie ever made.
871;The movie made you think after which is always good.
872;good movie, good directing, mediocore acting, and a interesting screenplay
873;I just cant belive the guy who said, what about this, how does that guy didnt do,,, come on ITS A MOVIE and a very good one.
874;scaryyyyyy, good plot, nice ending.
875;it has a decent flow, except for the parts where the camera gets hyperactive and crappy rock music blares for no real reason.
876;watch it, then you will see that i'm right.
877;a voice on an intercom system tells the men what to do.
878;puzzler, that sets people up to try and get them to appreciate their lives.
879;it's pretty typical, with a hint of originality every once in a while.
880;anyway, there is a pretty funny commentary between the two guys that wrote the movie (i don't remember their names, James Wan and somebody Leigh or something).
881;if you're into slasher movies and don't really care about plot holes or acting, then you will enjoy this movie and the extra features on the disc, mainly the commentary, which is mainly funny 'cause the two guys behind the movie just poke fun at their own creation the whole time.
882;saw is a decent attempt at something new, and it succeeds for the most part.
883;Jigsaw is a diabolical and ingenious menace.
884;But each of the two men have found a cassette with the words Play Me on them.
885;There are rules to be followed.
886;In the end the story delivers with a series of twists at the end that just leave you stunned.
887;I have to say that it was a pleasure to see an intelligent horror film again (they are so rare).
888;The acting, action, and settings were top notch.
889;Several moments made me jump (also a rare thing).
890;If you like your horror raw and intelligent then this is one for you.
891;The story is brilliant, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire length of the film.
892;This is definitely a must see.
893;This was probably the best movie I saw last year.
894;rivers there's a message on the movie: enjoy life what it last.
895;Saw is a pretty grotesque story yet had an intriguing story.
896;As someone who HATES horror movies I was very happy to find this as being much more of a psychological, though still gory, movie.
897;"(as a completely random side note, I have always loved Cary Elwes, especially in ""The Princess Bride"" so it was interesting seeing him doing a movie like this."
898;thats a very important part of a horror movie and trust me this movies had plenty of oportunities to show some.
899;There are some horror films that are really good, meaning they have a solid story, genuine thrills, and leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
900;"Examples of good horror films are ""Final Destination"", the `Scream' trilogy, and the classic ""Halloween""."
901;His latest victims are a successful doctor (Cary Elwes) and a young photographer (Leigh Whannell, who also wrote the screenplay).
902;"now, some of you may be wondering where I came up with the comparison of ""Saw"" and ""Se7en"", well here it is."
903;Both villains are patient, smart, and incredibly deranged in their view of the world, and feel completely justified in the pain they inflict upon their victims.
904;Generally the cast of horror films consists of some of the newest actors Hollywood has to offer, and generally will focus heavily on talk of sex and feature plenty of nudity from its attractive leading ladies, thus ensuring plenty of teenagers (especially guys) will give the movie a generous box office return and maybe even repeat business.
905;Most of the cast were very effective in their roles, even screenwriter Leigh Whannell as the other man trapped with Cary Elwes, was surprisingly good as an actor.
906;"For an actor who has been around as long as he has, it's kind of a surprise that he's never managed to elevate his craft from anything more than that of an average actor who has a tendency to overact in his dramatic parts, but excels when it comes to comedy which is probably why ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" and ""The Princess Bride"" are the two biggest movies of his career."
907;The decision to give Cary top.
908;Saw is without a doubt a very creepy horror film that delivers plenty of chills, but also gives audiences a solid story that will keep them guessing what will happen next.
909;Saw is available in both rated R and unrated editions both contain violence and language.
910;Great suspense and great plot= a great movie.
911;cause most people do that especially with popular movies or movies that are going to be a sequel or remake so keep this in mind next time.
912;as for my review on the movie, its one of the most original horror films ive seen, great mixure of seven and silence of the lambs with a great twist.
913;This is the perfect example of Hollywood's inability to no longer generate an original thought.
914;Guess I just wanted a little escapism.
915;This movie has a great plot but as it was one of the first released titles on Blu.
916;There haven't been a lot of good, scary movies recently except I thought this one was very scary and intriguing.
917;I liked the plotline even though the actors could use a few more classes.
918;The concept of this film was incredible .
919;it's psychologically and physiologically thrilling .
920;The story is very good and there's lots of suspense(i dont know how you could fall asleep watching it because it at least has a good story, even if it's not that gory).
921;It is quite entertaining and demented, and James Wan(the director)did a good job on his first movie.
922;See it and watch it with an open mind and dont put it down because its not that gory, because i've seen pleanty of gory movies that suck and thats because it didn't have a good plot(example:Candyman)Thank you and enjoy the movie!
923;An interesting premise and a very well put trailer would lead you to believe that this movie follows in the footsteps of Se7en.
924;Okay you got the surprise, now what's the purpose?
925;This is the best of the saw series.
926;The story was the best, the acting was the best, the rest is history.
927;While watching the film I really thought that `saw is life.'
928;A few of the reviews pretty much say it all.
929;It was a decent horror movie.
930;HOWEVER:This movie is worth seeing once, because the ending is AMAZING.
931;I'm a fan of SAW.
932;Those are the best kind of horror movies.
933;Saw is an amazing horror flick and Jigsaw (Bell) is definitley a new horror hero.
934;This film really has a cool idea about a killer who doesn't actually kill his victims.
935;He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves.
936;performances are very good, some over the top, but very good.
937;The ending really makes this film one of the best films of 2004.
938;It is scary in the sense that it could be something that could actually occur in life, so that's a scary way to look at it.
939;The movie is intense and the suspense drives the movie until the very end.
940;A very good movie if you want to be on the edge of your seat.
941;There are so many twists and turns in this movie.
942;It's good, really really good.
943;definitely the most traumatizing and sickest movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
944;The charecters were abit sketchy at times but other than that, it is, a smart horror film which kept you guessing till the end pulling you in with stranger than fiction twists.
945;over all an enjoyable ride.
946;Intrinsic motivation stems from within a person while the extrinsic source is influence generated by someone or something else.
947;The room has intense lighting once the lights are turned on, which tosses no shadows of either character.
948;In essence, it is a visual analogy for how their persona will be scrutinized by both parties, as the light will reveal everything.
949;It is also revealed that Dr. Gordon is aware of who the person is that has chained them in the unfamiliar room.
950;The great extent to which the Jigsaw killer has planned his bizarre schemes will display a man with enormous amount motivation to seek some form of enlightenment in an outmost horrific manner.
951;A mind to generate such horrors illustrates deep insights into psychology and human behavior, but it also displays the eccentricity of a creative mind.
952;the film had a good beginning theme, however, after about an hour and ten minutes the film seemed to begin slowly spiral downwards.
953;Nonetheless, Saw offers a truly ghastly film experience, which is built on good script and good mise.
954;The camera work elevates the film, as it brings moments to the audience that will awaken feelings of revulsion and dismay.
955;Many times a cop will have a gun pointed at the killer, but WON'T SHOOT!
956;but I was awed by the film's brilliance.
957;Solid acting, creative cinematography, and the most disturbing and mind.
958;i was so impressed, I saw each sequel on its opening day.
959;Think of the savagery and bloodiness of Seven with the atmosphere and puzzlement of The Game.
960;paced, has some great visiual (often disturbing) imagery, and has an awesome ending you won't see coming for a thousand miles.
961;Saw is an brilliant suspense thriller!
962;"It is one of the best suspense thrillers since ""Seven"" and ""The Silence Of The Lambs""!"
963;budgeted, as its production budget cost $1 million to make the movie and it is one of the best.
964;This is one of the best independent films in recent history and of all time.
965;"It is better than ""The Blair Witch Project""."
966;Danny Glover (well known as Roger Murtagh in the Lethal Weapon movies) is superb as Tapp.
967;The directing by James Wan is excellent.
968;The story by Wan and Whannell is brilliant and the screenplay by Whannell is brilliant, as well.
969;It is inventive and well thoughtout.
970;The music by Charlie Clouser (a producer for the rock group Nine Inch Nails) is excellent.
971;The casting by Amy Lippens is excellent.
972;The cinematography by David A. Armstrong is brilliant.
973;The film editing by Kevin Greutert is excellent.
974;The costume design by Jennifer L. Soulages is excellent.
975;The production design by Julie Berghoff is brilliant.
976;The art direction by Nanet Harty is brilliant.
977;It is a great movie to watch on Halloween.
978;"I considered seeing ""Saw"" in the theater."
979;"compared to the brilliant ""Seven""."
980;"enforced later by ""Open Water,"" but it was also the studio that brought us the extraordinary ""Frailty"" which led me to believe that those films may have been just mis."
981;Saw began to restore my faith from its opening scene.
982;If you're looking for a horror or scary movie to watch this definitely isn't the movie for you, but if you need a good laugh it's perfect.
983;Afterall, I laughed my head off because some of that stuff was so cheesy.
984;I wonder who's bright idea that was.
985;"jiggsaw"" shows that you must have a near death experience to love life and charish it the way it should be."
986;its good and smartly written for the meaning behind it, because i'm tired of some of these remakes originality in hollywood writting must be at an all time lowI just wanna say you have 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it.
987;The acting between the two guys in the bathroom was pretty cheesy, but other than that, I liked it so much I watched it twice!
988;This film is a creepfest on par with Silence of the Lambs.
989;The writers [and killer] burrow into your mind.
990;What are you truly capable of if your loved ones are in danger?
991;now THAT movie was great!Extremely suspenseful, great plot, excellent acting, and scary.
992;"Inside is a key and a small cassette tape with the words ""Play Me."""
993;Saw is a film that works more in the world of horror films than it does in the real world, but that is certainly part for the genre at this point.
994;I confess that I was totally riveted to the screen for the entire running time of the film, as was my son.
995;In doing so, he forces a viewer's imagination to work overtime, which serves to create more suspense than a visual statement of the obvious.
996;the plot is diabolically clever.
997;what follows is a mesmerizing cat and mouse game, replete with a number of twists and turns, that is sure to keep the viewer enthralled.
998;Moreover, the plot is so creative and riveting, that some of its flaws become virtually insignificant in the overall scheme of things.
999;The screenwriter, Leigh Whannell, who also plays the part of Adam, deserves kudos for his complex and clever screenplay.
1000;Mr. Whannell should concentrate on screenplay writing, as it is there that his true gift lies.
1001;Notwithstanding this relatively minor criticism, I love this film!
1002;"the films gives us clues to the identity of Jigsaw, directing attention to the orderly called Mr. Hindel aka ""Zepp""."
1003;The film is a Hitchcockian mystery to figure out 'who is doing this.
1004;I am usually quite pleased and impressed with the differences.
1005;Smartly done and highly recommended.
1006;I saw SAW II and the original SAW is the one that started it all.
1007;Interesting villain with interesting motives, and the twist at the end had me gasping in the theater.
1008;for what they spent on this, it is an excellent movie.
1009;the ending was the best part.
1010;when you go and see this, just set aside criticisms for the acting and you will really enjoy this one.
1011;"Most of the ""scary"" parts will just make you laugh, because you do not develop even the slightest connection to any of the characters whatsoever."
1012;The one redeeming factor of this movie is the ending, which is the only part I enjoyed.
1013;"i don't really look for horror movies to really have good ""acting."""
1014;There are two kinds of moviegoers: fans of horror films and those who aren't fans of horror films.
1015;if you fit into the Horror Films>Gory Horror Films category, this movie is perfect for you.
1016;"Mike: ""Hurry and Program in the Numbers."
1017;i found this movie creepy and exciting.
1018;It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1019;It's intrigating and smart and it has such a surprising end.
1020;If you like suspense you are going to love it.
1021;"i was pleasantly surprised to discover that Saw is actually not a thinly veiled takeoff of ""Se7en"" at all!"
1022;after the initial genre confusion wore off, I found it a very enjoyable film indeed.
1023;But it's more than that.
1024;cary Elwes plays an extremely convincing role as a self.
1025;man with tiny pretty eyes.
1026;Stay for the wacky dismemberment sequence.
1027;VI , are SEVEN and, of course, Silence Of The Lambs !!
1028;What you're of mind comes up with this????
1029;In between them is the body of a man that shot himself in the head.
1030;The two victims figure out that an ingenious serial killer known as the jigsaw killer placed them there.
1031;This movie is worth watching.
1032;See if you can figure out who the killer is.
1033;This movie is a great mind games horror movie.You have to have creativity to understand this movie.
1034;i got to say slasher horror movies are old,to me this was a good change of pace.
1035;I just finished watching Saw and thought it was a great movie.
1036;First of all, it is a breath of fresh air, having THE BEST TWIST I have ever seen in any movie EVER!
1037;The death/gore scenes are sickly brilliant!
1038;I am yet to see 2, but this one is very hard to top.
1039;Best horror movie ever made if you ask me.
1040;It actually has a carefully orchestrated plot.
1041;It even builds up on a mental level and not just on a visual one.
1042;Bought this as a Christmas gift.
1043;I personally do not like any of the Saw movies, but my son loved it!
1044;What can i say Saw is a brilliant film, an like many brilliant films it is also low budget.
1045;now don't let that put you off, because it is extremely entertaining.
1046;The movie does not look excellent, but it does look very good.
1047;Looked very good in the trailers.
1048;I really liked the premise of this movie and understand why it spawned a sequel, but what about that terrible acting!?!
1049;Saw is one of the early blu.
1050;ray releases, so it's a single.
1051;It uses a high bit.
1052;eS track is nice, it's still lossy audio.
1053;So, as a true fan of terror on film, I had to judge for myself.
1054;i found the plot to be quite creative and intriguing.
1055;Cary Elwes surprised me in this role, showing a far darker side than he's ever before revealed on.
1056;the movie is suspenseful and interesting, with a good and somewhat startling ending.
1057;Wow, movies today are getting more repulsive and disgusting by the minute.
1058;Danny Glover and the rest of the cast should be ashamed of themselves.
1059;I had high hopes for this film and feel so wronged after finally having seen it.
1060;The premise is very intriguing: two strangers wake up in a wickedly dirty bathroom, their feet chained to metal poles, or the wall (does it really matter, just know they were bound).
1061;hounds are in for a treat after Elwes puts the saws provided the two near the beginning to good use near the end.
1062;The reason why I gave it three stars rather than two is because the plot is actually quite interesting and unique.
1063;With a plot this good you would have thought better actors, and better writers would have endeavored in this project.
1064;Do you like characters, interesting dialogue, and a solid plot?
1065;But, of all of the horror movies I have ever seen, Saw has to be the best piece of work ever created.
1066;Lions Gate Films has a knack for horror movie (as they have produce many, like House of 1000 corpses), and they have landed another great one with Saw.
1067;It is extremely well made and everything about it is flawless.
1068;to start off, Saw has to be the most intriguing story of any movie ever made.
1069;The story is simply a work of pure genius.
1070;so, but it is acceptable.
1071;What is kind of cool is that the co. producer actually aacted in the movie.
1072;It catches you attention by means of a clever and intelligent first act, then goes to unlimited plot twists and clever editing that makes your brain gets numb and you will feel that you are watching a great movie, that you are being entertained.
1073;cut, snappy title sequence a la David Fincher.
1074;"The great title sequence of ""Saw"" is about the extent of the creative, adventurous juices on view in this film."
1075;And the actual director of this film, James Wan (what an appropriate name!)
1076;Decent acting and a decent story as well, here lately it has been none of the above mentioned in horror movies.
1077;Definately worth checking out and it has a good ending as well.
1078;Brilliantly clever and orchestrated with a vengeance, SAW is one of the most disturbing psychological horror films of recent times.
1079;Cary Elwes gives an unusual performance, one that is at times wooden and unbelievable and at other times, so erratic and tense, he becomes frighteningly realistic.
1080;This was defiantly the best of the SAW franchise, but they lacked on traps, the creativity wasn't ver great, as the SAWs go on, they get more and more creative.
1081;This is a must see for any horror movie fan.
1082;The first movie is the best, there is very little blood.
1083;It's mostly a psychological thriller.
1084;, so my wife and I got the chance to see it.
1085;In one hand is a gun, in the other a tape recorder.
1086;Eventually, our two protagonists discover they have a tape in their pocket, and a lot more in common than they think.
1087;Jigsaw is a genius on the level of a Batman villain, a master of puppeteering, trap making, and disguise.
1088;Finding out how our protagonists answer those questions is half the fun.
1089;And Jigsaw is a diabolical genius with a lot of time on his hands.
1090;still, Saw managed to surprise me with its ending.
1091;There's enough gruesome traps and awful choices that one of them is bound to strike a nerve with every viewer, enough to make your skin crawl.
1092;In that respect, Saw is a resounding success.
1093;Saw is an intense, twisted movie.
1094;"It is reminiscent of ""Seven"" in both mood and atmosphere, and leaves you with about the same feeling when it is all over."
1095;"For me, that is good, because I believe ""Seven"" to be an excellent movie."
1096;Director James Wan ratchets up the tension with each passing moment until the final scene.
1097;"Saw is a great Halloween movie, and if you are looking for a good scary movie at this time of the year, ""Saw"" is your best bet."
1098;Highly recommended for horror fans.
1099;So I'll just say, this an interesting movie because every.
1100;But it was the best minutes out of the whole experience.
1101;That scene of superbly done, the music was just right and the ending was what got me.
1102;Dina Meyer and Shawnee Smith also star in Saw 2 as the same characters.
1103;overall production is slick and dark with great overtones of meance and horror, which is an achivement when one thinks that this is a very low budget flick with some b to d grade actors (Glover and Ewles).
1104;I guessed before the ending of Seven what would happen and i was right.
1105;Therefore , it makes sense to me that he was able to do what he did.
1106;the film is advertised as a thriller and it certainly has those elements but clearly it does fit into the world of horror more and this suits the overall film.
1107;overall, a very good horror/thriller that deserves more regonision than it gets and i look forward to seeing SAW 2 and finding out more about the man who likes to play games.
1108;"[with due respect to ""7""]."
1109;This is the movie that got me into horror films.
1110;It's clever, its crazy, and its so twisted.
1111;The one that started it all, began the story of the jigsaw killer.
1112;Love this movie along with the other 6.
1113;The scariest part of the movie and the saw movies are, as messed up as the traps are in it.
1114;Really makes you think and piece it all together!
1115;I convinced a friend to see it, and it becomes about the who is doing what rather than the blood and gore.
1116;SAW is one of those movies it will take you repeated viewings to dissect certain parts and understand the plot and the importance of the characters, and boy are you in for one hell of a surprise ending when you see it for the first time.
1117;"sAW tells the tale of a serial murderer known as the ""jigsaw killer"" who decides to kidnap two men, one is a doctor who is married to a beautiful wife and has children with her, while the other man seems very insignificant to us, not bearing any importance or meaning to us in the movie, except that he committed some kind of heinous act according to the the killer."
1118;It worked quite well to jolt my chill factor.
1119;You are going to be even more repulsed by this smart horror film.
1120;sAW spins a web of suspense, scares, and brains into a complex and jolting thriller that most certainly will prepare you for what's to come with it's follower, SAW II.
1121;This was a great movie.
1122;If you liked Seven, I highly recommend it.
1123;The ending is so cool and I would definitely watch it again!
1124;This first edition is still the scariest.
1125;A new twist in the horror/thriller type of movies.
1126;Well done with the suspense levels.
1127;If you like bloody shows with body parts cut off you will love this movie.
1128;The Jigsaw killers final line in the film will be mine as well.
1129;A compelling sereal killer, some graphic violence, that creepy laughing clown .
1130;"Saw clearly draws its inspiration from ""Seven,"" with a little bit of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""The Cell"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" thrown in for good measure."
1131;"note to Hollywood directors: A ""twist"" is only satisfying if it makes logical sense within the context of the picture."
1132;two stars for some graphic violence, a rarity in mainstream horror films these days.
1133;There are also a few jumping moments in the movie.
1134;It is a great story, lots of suprises, some things you just cant believe!
1135;Great movie, great story, recommended it to everyone I know.
1136;obviously there is a fascination.
1137;because the stories have spilled onto prime time 1.
1138;Ever since SIXTH SENSE, majority of thrillers try so hard to hit us with a twist, and it disappoints everytime.
1139;", the way he waved to the camera ""I can see you""."
1140;I see all these 5stars everywhere.
1141;SAW is the most interesting movie ive ever had the honor to view.
1142;Though the acting is not the greatest,the overall theme and various messeges of the movie make it all worth while.
1143;In order to enjoy it,you have to try to get inside the jigsaw killer's twisted mind.
1144;He tests his victims to see what they will do to stay alive (to prove the value of life).
1145;There is an art to the jigsaw killers actions.
1146;low production value, a great film can be made.
1147;see the movie for myself.
1148;The film had plenty of suspense, chills, and thrills around every unexpected twist and turn.
1149;I found the idea of the movie fresh.
1150;I welcomed each intense moment.
1151;"In this case I recommend ""Saw"" to those who like well paced horror."
1152;People, I agree it's not as good as Seven or Silence of the Lambs like they are comparing it to, but it is still a great film in it's own right.
1153;I found it very interesting and it wasn't as gruesome as some are making it out to be.
1154;If you like thrillers than this is one you'll like.
1155;I liked this movie, I am a big horror film buff.
1156;This wasnt TOO scary, but just enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.
1157;Full of mystery, and plenty of suspence.
1158;This is a good thing and it is really more in the same vein as Se7en and Halloween etc.
1159;A good entry in the horror genre and much better than I expected.
1160;If you must see a Saw then this is the Saw to see.
1161;Saw has got to be one ov the best films i have seen for a long long time.
1162;its definatly the best horror ive ever seen.
1163;It is clever, probably too clever for its own good.
1164;one mark of a good movie is when you forget you're watching a movie: with all the stylized direction and overly clever plotting, it's hard to get that absorbed in this film.
1165;It also owes a lot to other movies, especially Seven, and you might be better off seeing those movies.
1166;This movie is one of the best [Maybe the best] horror film from 2004.
1167;This is a wonderful horror film that i would reccomend to all horror fans.
1168;This movie certainly has to be the best horror film that's been released in the 2000's so far.
1169;And, To top things off, This movie even has a clever ending that you'll never see coming.
1170;The plot is excellent, The acting is good, and The movie is actually more than just a whole bunch of murder scenes.
1171;Danny Glover [Showing up here as a former cop who lost his partner who's still in pursuit of the jigsaw killer out of vengeance] Turns in a good performance in this movie.
1172;Have a nice day, Be blessed.
1173;Try out some of the best, most disturbing work anywhere .
1174;A well thought out little horror story with a great look for the budget and timeframe in which it was shot.
1175;the whole film as a package is well done.
1176;The concept was good and in better hands .
1177;it couldve been an okay film .
1178;I was told by one of my friends that this film was ''the best movie ever''.
1179;Now , because my friend is one of the most intelligent people i know , i thought to myself ''wow , this must be really good.''
1180;From there it goes quite well , suspense and mystery build up reasonably , and the viewer sits there in awe wondering about how the men will get out of the situation they are in , and who is the person responsible.
1181;This ''twist''is actually the dumbest twist i have seen im a movie for as long as i can remember.
1182;The best psychological thriller I have seen, this movie will leave you in shock by the end.
1183;Smart and cleverly written by Aussie's Leigh Wannell and James Wan, and directed by the latter, this movie breaks down all the boundaries of on screen violence.
1184;I don't care for the othe saw movies but this one will be a true classic
1185;I saw this movie at the theater and was VERY impressed with the storyline.
1186;The original Saw draws inspiration from older slasher and exploitation films with some great ideas of it's own.
1187;If there's anything bad to say about Saw, it's that the acting is very wooden, there's plenty of leaps in logic, and the first is definitely the best.
1188;I love the Saw series, and I noticed that this was a really great price on the UMD format of the film.
1189;Overall I am satisfied with the product and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an intense, gruesome movie experience with a shocking ending!
1190;Danny Glover, Cary Elws and Monica Potter star in this low budget, but spectacular and exceptionally clever film.
1191;but I highly recommend seeing it.
1192;This one will haunt you for a while.
1193;oh, and please hold on for the ending.
1194;It'll take your breath away!!!
1195;A need for any Saw fan, seeing as it gives even more insight into the series than just listening to commentaries.
1196;When I was watching the movie I figured that it was like the rest of them until the ending came about.
1197;The film is more of a pyschological thriller vs a horror movie.
1198;It will keep you interested.
1199;It will always have you there guessing the next move.
1200;A lot of twists and turns.
1201;to make a film more horrifying and gripping than it actually is.
1202;Horror films, by definition, involve the supernatural.
1203;He was always an average actor at best, and pretty much destroys any credibility he ever had here.
1204;As far as the story goes, well.
1205;"winning,"" you really need to see more movies made before 2000."
1206;pPS: be aware that a lot of reviews give away key scenes and/or the ending.
1207;Very enjoyable, and I did not find it mean spirited.
1208;the story is a straight up psychological thriller, and very well written.
1209;The film had HUGE hangups during production, and it's those restrictions that made it what it is.
1210;i can easily draw the comparison between the first Saw film, and the video game Alan Wake.
1211;What makes it work is how it's pulled off, plus the stories and situations for both are incredibly compelling.
1212;it did absolutely NOTHING for me.
1213;The only redeeming things about the movie are the premise, which is great, and the ending, which had a twist.
1214;I honestly cant recommend this.
1215;AND I was SO happy when Danny Glover got massacred in this movie.
1216;I actually stood up and clapped.
1217;Half an hour in, I thought it had potential.
1218;I really liked this movie.
1219;"I won't repeat all the comments already posted, but this film reminded me of a cross between ""Seven"" and Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" (if you haven't seen Cube, I recommend that as well."
1220;A tightly spun story unfolds nicely through flashbacks and present tense with some solid acting in particular by Cary Elwes.
1221;The ending for some might fall a little flat seeming a little forced, but the first 1 hr and 24 minutes is really good stuff, very twisted and original.
1222;"Still the best ""new"" horror flick I have seen in awhile."
1223;By the end of the movie, you feel like you have been through a war, and that you have watched one of the best horror films made in the last few years.
1224;Saw, which is rated R, is a great horror/suspense movie that takes one part Blair Witch Project, one part Silence of the Lambs and one part Se7en to make a movie that will stay in your head for days to come.
1225;The doctor fellow knows who this killer is, because he used to be a suspect in the case.
1226;Instead of working out a great mystery over how this all came to be, we're just TOLD it (but with twists, see, because twists a good horror movie make).
1227;Now that it's important for the audience to know!
1228;So it's definitely not what I would call the most tightly wound thriller, but the premise is a very good one.
1229;so ultimately, fun to watch, not the greatest slice of horror pie ever.
1230;This is a great addition to your collection.
1231;If you love horror, and twists, you'll love SAW!!!
1232;I love the gore and the puzzle ideas.
1233;I think that the ending was well thought out and wonderful.
1234;Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be.
1235;and, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there.
1236;This movie is sure to please those both into psychological horror and horror just for the fun of it.
1237;On top of that there is some great acting that is rarely found in scary movies.
1238;intense fear on a cute guys face.
1239;I would recommend it to a select audience but enforce the fact that it's a good nighttime movie.
1240;This is a very good movie.
1241;The days of happy endings are over.
1242;The scenes where we saw previous victims was intense.
1243;Other than that great movie.
1244;It is rated R for a reason.
1245;I believe anything could be better than this 'film', even cutting myself to pieces and filming it would be more fun than this crap!Danny Glover stars in this.
1246;Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be.
1247;People, mostly kids and young adults, are paying good money to enjoy watching inhuman acts.
1248;and, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there.
1249;Oh yeah, and the $18 million opening weekend on a film that only cost about one million doesn't hurt either.
1250;Credit an imaginative screenplay with plenty of reversals at the end.
1251;Now I know why the production company is called Twisted Pictures, the movie twists and twists and twists.
1252;A lot of people have called these plot developments implausible, I prefer creative.
1253;With the success of SAW I bet we see the return of the antagonist.
1254;And from there, they must piece together the events that have led up to their capture, as well as find a way out of their predicament before six o' clock.
1255;And there's a lot of visual fluffing, in terms of flashy camerawork and overwrought flashback sequences.
1256;Director James Wan's success in establishing the initial hopelessness and melancholia of the captives' situation is admirable, given that it's so simple.
1257;pieces are similarly original .
1258;but the imagery that Wan uses is very unsettling in places, and very effective because of this.
1259;"all in all, ""Saw"" is highly deserving of praise for being a truly original and very effective movie."
1260;made, it's tense, and it's very compelling.
1261;For those who rated this movie a 1 star, don't believe them, I wonder why they watch this movie if they are into a Love Story genre movies, duh!
1262;I watched it last nite and I was quite impressed.
1263;Director James Wan's youthful zeal and excitement is beautifully executed, but nothing can compare to David Fincher's meticulous style.
1264;I enjoyed it and was entertained a lot.
1265;I'll give them one star for originality, and one star for good cosmetic effects, the rest just isn't there.
1266;This film is far from being one of the scariest movies (ever).
1267;by which time it has evolved into an excellent movie.
1268;"Introducing experienced actresses like Dana Meyer (""Star Ship Troopers"", ""Bats"") and Shawnee Smith (""The Blob"") certainly helped with the acting (Shawnee is the girl in the trailer reel who survives)!"
1269;Ultimately, this psychopath is so brilliant that he makes Hannibal look infantile!
1270;"If you liked ""Silence of the Lambs"", then this is a MUST see movie."
1271;This is definitely one of those movies which you probably need to see to more than once to pick up on everything.
1272;the movie misdirects on many occasions so that it can surprise you later.
1273;They give you quick glimpses of the killer, and just when you think you were clever enough to spot his face and figure out who he is, you get a surprise!
1274;Quite an intriguing movie to see if you're up for being disturbed afterwards.
1275;I believe this film had promise.
1276;This movie will keep you guessing right till the very end.
1277;Oh, and each man has a hacksaw.
1278;It carried a lurid fascination.
1279;And the resolution of the film, while a bit pat, was surprising and twisty.
1280;but do we?So, the pluses are there: it's a compelling story (although we feel a little unclean watching it), has some surprises and has an over.
1281;top art direction and cinematography that is admirable in its fearlessness.
1282;And for the most part, that's good enough.
1283;Parts of it feel scotch.
1284;If you like stuff like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SE7EN and that ilk, you'll probably be okay with this film.
1285;SAW is a deliciously psychotic crime thriller that keeps you guessing till the very end.
1286;The production values are high and the acting is competantly well above the vast majority of similar creepshows.
1287;But I really enjoyed this movie: I don't want to get picky.
1288;as a mystery, it's great.
1289;A good mystery must very carefully hide the true answers, all the while dropping sufficient clues to allow the viewer to slove the puzzle.
1290;Saw succeeds perfectly and the misdirection is inspiring.
1291;so, see this film and enjoy.
1292;"Try not to read any spoilers
1293;If you want to see something really funny, watch it with someone squeamish.
1294;That's amusing to me because SAW made me H U N G R Y !!
1295;Still this film is so highly enjoyable, especially for fans of the movie Se7ven.
1296;sAW is a great film, not so great acting, great twist(oh my oh my who saw that coming)though it's a bit flawed and I'm not going to explain why, just go on forums and you'll see.
1297;it's a really great film.4.0 out of 5 stars
1298;Loved the ending in this movie.
1299;What makes a good actor is the variety of parts he/she can play, geez.
1300;Back to Saw, Good movie, great ending, intelligent, good acting (exclude Glover).
1301;See Saw as it's own entity, and you will have a better chance of liking it.
1302;This 2004 movie has a very unique premise: Jigsaw, the film's """"killer"""", doesn't actually kill his victims"
1303;"I thought that made this much more enjoyable than your standard ""slash `em up"" fare."
1304;"the actual killing scenes also brought this up a few notches from your traditional ""modern"" horror movie."
1305;Each scenario was ingenuous and very suspenseful.
1306;If anything, it added realism and made each of the scenes raw and disturbing in a surprisingly entertaining way.
1307;It's good to know they really know what to do with those halloween body parts.
1308;"Then last night, I stayed the night with my friend and she owned it and said ""Let's watch it."""
1309;"My friend screamed throughout the whole movie and I just stared at it like ""Wow."
1310;But if you're interesed in shows like CSI, Third Watch, and mystery movies, go ahead and be my guest.
1311;"There are a few original ideas like ""the head vice"" butfor the most part the movie just takes bits and pieces fromother movies of the genre and puts them together."
1312;Obviously the ending proves there will be a sequel so do not worry.
1313;Cube is much scarier and better made, using a similar idea.
1314;"The cover, however, is really cool, a great novelty with the red oil ""blood"" and water and floating saw blade."
1315;Still fun to shake it back and forth and make it look like you are sawing the hand.
1316;to me this movie looked great in the previews and I always enjoy horror movies that critics give bad ratings to.
1317;Halloween sets the standard in horror, as far as I'm concerned, and this is in no way on par with that movie, but it kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat.
1318;It's a simple plot filled with a lot of elaborate killings scenes.
1319;He, as well as every character in this huge blunder, is completely unbelievable, and the production is as good as a middle school talent show.
1320;Well I have to say that jigsaw is one of the most intriguing criminals I've seen.
1321;"As compared to like a scream film or something this was just ""How much blood and torture can we get away with"" I still think it is worth watching more than once but loosed entertainment value (IN MY EYES) as you watch it more and more."
1322;I hope you enjoy my comment and comment on my status :) Have a good time.
1323;It doesn't succeed on any level, but is a decent horror/thriller.
1324;"offs, ""Saw"" delivers some good scenes of scares and holds up as a decent horror flick, despite Cary Elwe's god."
1325;"This movie is classified as a ""horror"" movie but it is very very intense as well."
1326;There is no one running up stairs instead of out of the front door type of situations, only those who keep you on the edge of your seat.
1327;i was very impressed with the plot, considering most horror movies forget to add those in the mix of blood shed and screams.
1328;The movie will definitely leave you guessing and your heart racing.
1329;overall this is one of the best horror movies I have seen.
1330;I believe it opens up a whole new world of opportunity for movies that can get to their viewer mentally.
1331;This movie is an adrenaline pumping, graphic and shocking take on the Suspense/Horror/Thriller Combo.
1332;This is one of the scariest films I have ever seen.
1333;The realistic visuals take you further into the story adding a depth to it that I can't even recall having seen before.
1334;The cast does a wonderful job with this story and each one brought their character vividly to life.
1335;The lines between reality and fiction are crossed in the style of movie it is and how it was shot I felt my pulse pounding and as if I were there with the characters.
1336;I saw this movie and began telling all my family and friends to see it.
1337;if you are in the least bit squeemish DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE!This is the one time what they describe is absolutely delivered.
1338;With some of the PG.13 tripe coming out as horror nowadays, SAW is a refreshing step back into the good old days where horror meant blood, and blood meant horror.
1339;Each man is given a tape to play, which provides him with a nice dilemma to ponder during his captivity.
1340;because SAW also brings to film an excellent `Whodunnit?'
1341;Suffice to say that Cary Elwes and Danny Glover give excellent performances (Elwes surprising me since I have only seen him in comedy roles), the photography is good, the killing methods tasty, the blood not really overdone but still dosed out well, and the plot sustainable.
1342;lets face it fans, we don't go to horror movies to learn how to do decoupage, we go to get scared and grossed out.
1343;aficionados of the genre are going to love SAW's mixture of gore, insanity, ingenious traps, and filth, while non.
1344;"In terms of its ability to scare and disturb, ""Saw"" is an A+ film."
1345;It's extremely raw and gritty, full of suspense, and contains some seriously disturbing subject matter and several now.
1346;infamous scenes of intense terror.
1347;This is one of the most original movies I've ever seen and since it ranks as one of my favorite movies, I decided to let others know.
1348;I'm a big fan of horror/thrillers and I really enjoyed this movie.
1349;I would recommend watching this if you're into suspense thrillers.
1350;lol I hope you like it as much as I did and let me know if this was helpful!
1351;The movie is great, the picture is awesome.
1352;This is the best directorial debut since QT's Resevoir Dogs (because it set the standard for stylish movies).
1353;James Wan did a great job with a great script, and I hope to see many more films from him, esspecially in this genre, I think he would also make a good action film because of his fast paced no holds bar visions.
1354;The story is original and creepy, but somehow realistic, and provides many shocking moments and memorable scenes, and the twist ending(which i wont ruin for you) was just amazingly shocking, and dare i say, it is just as good of a twist as anything from M. Night (the master of twist endings) if not better.
1355;This is a very well crafted horror suspense drama, from the story to music to the performances to the cinematography to the.
1356;This resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of horror productions I watched each year.
1357;"I am happy to say that ""Saw"" was reminiscent of the good old times."
1358;the previous cases show us a very creative and twisted individual, who does not really kill his victims, but makes them kill themselves.
1359;If you like horror films though, I guarantee that you will be entertained through the duration of this movie and that your nerves are going to be seriously tested.
1360;Everything else on this movie is right on target.
1361;Because Saw offers one heck of a great time, that's why.
1362;But what the film delivers, it delivers it great.
1363;In fact, stop thinking and just enjoy the ride for what it is.
1364;grimmy, atmospheric, dark and disturbing, Saw is a horror movie you'll want to watch with your hands covering your eyes.
1365;A great source of entertainment, if nothing more.
1366;The acting is good, until the doctor starts yelling out his wifes name too loud, then it gets hilarious.
1367;The murderer, though I will not give it away, was witty.
1368;The film, overall is getting three stars from me because the storyline was excellent, but I did not care if the main characters were to die or not.
1369;This is the first and as far as im concerned the best of the Saw movies.
1370;This movie is very original and the ways the writter has Jigsaw torture these people is cool and very disturbing.
1371;This was recommended by my brother due to the fact he knows how I love great horror films.
1372;The storyline was very captivating and everything seems to fall into place as the storyline continues.
1373;saw is definently a good movie that keeps you thinking.
1374;i am about to watch saw II and then saw III, and i am very excited to do so, i know i'm kind of late on watching the first 2, i wish i would've watched them a long time ago.
1375;i would definently recommend these films.4 stars.
1376;This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer.
1377;"The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller
1378;At first, Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance"
1379;I was left in tears of laughter at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie.
1380;Along the way, there are some truly memorable scenes (Adam's hunt for the murderer in the dark using his camera's flash) and more than one or two haunting images (a young woman who rips through a man's stomach to find the key needed to save her).
1381;two constant themes with most films of this type are the intelligence of the villain and evil often being able to outwit good.
1382;Both properties are well emphasized here.
1383;though the acting is nothing spectacular and the movie was significantly underfunded, Saw entrances the viewer with a sweet, manaical storyline, an intricate cast of characters, and plot twist after unforgettable plot twist.
1384;All in all, it ranks as one of the best films 2004 had to offer, resulting as a sinister combination of Seven and Identity.
1385;Some of the stuff he/she comes up with is just amazing.
1386;the storyline was very unique,and actually very realistic.
1387;cary Elwes does a great job in this film.
1388;danny Glover also shines in his role as Detective Tapp.
1389;"but this movie will chill you to the bone, and will make you think twice about ever doing something that is considered ""not acceptable"" in today's society."
1390;Anyway, it filled part of my gore meter, so I was happy with it.
1391;For a film that was obviously made on a reletively low budget it mostly works well though.
1392;OK there are a few inconsistencies in the plot but I thought it was pretty well acted and the twist at the end is well done.
1393;There are some genuinely creepy, not to mention grisly, moments scattered throughout the film.
1394;'Saw' feels just like that, artificious, clever.
1395;That gives me the goosebumps!'
1396;It's delivered in a way that makes you go 'Ok, that was clever, big deal', but it's a type of cleverness that says 'I did that so that you can't say it's a bad movie'.
1397;But there's no real atmosphere, it's just a 'clever' story that in the end I'd pass up.
1398;"I bought into the whole ""As innovative as Silence of the Lambs!!!!!"
1399;I like horror, I like suspense.
1400;this is one of those films that you will either love it or hate it.
1401;this is a good movie.
1402;Most of us now know the whole story behind this movie so I won't go into the details but I will say that I truly enjoyed this movie.
1403;Great movie for horror fans.
1404;With a great storyline of teaching people the value of life thru the eyes of Jigsaw, a very deranged man, Saw really delivers.
1405;The grisly violence adds to the success of this movie.
1406;Cool scenes with an ending leaving you to wonder if there will be a sequel.
1407;Saw II is also a great film which I reviewed.
1408;Both are chained by the ankle and in a believable state of confusion.
1409;"The ingenuity of the Jigsaw ""serial"" killer is remarkable."
1410;The film has wit and humor as well.
1411;"The most memorable line for me was Leigh Whannell's ""This is the most fun I've had without lubricant."""
1412;The gruesome scenes are rather intense, so those that have weak stomachs, watch out.
1413;"What I like is that this film is stepping in the right direction, away from teen horror flicks and the ""I'm a ghost and didn't know it"" flicks that seem to dominate the genre."
1414;One of this films strengths is that most of it plays out in a minimal environment, much like Reservoir Dogs, which places the focus of the suspense and horror on the character's actions, and helps keep the jump scares to a minimum.
1415;I also think that most of the devices and situations are believable if not original.
1416;One is calmer than the other.
1417;Saw is brilliant, simply put.
1418;And to think, it was made in 18 days!
1419;This movie may not be as terrifying as, say, The Exorcist (the best horror movie EVER), but it's still awesome to watch, as you never lose interest and it really makes you appreciate life more.
1420;Like good taste said, all those emos out there need to watch this.
1421;There's plenty of realistic gore to keep your appetite of cinema blood satisfied (even though the guts of the guy Amanda was cutting through to get the key to her head lock were COMPLETELY cheesy), and at the same time, it leaves you with a powerful moral.
1422;It may not change your mind, but it's bound to entertain you somehow.
1423;p. s. Check out Saw 2 as well.
1424;saw fared well at the box office.
1425;It also proved to be an entertaining modern day horror film that many people disregarded as being part of Hollywood's latest trend and fetish with trashy horror flicks.
1426;"Well, maybe it is because I'm a dumb horror fan who is used to the so called ""bad acting,"" but I really liked this film!Don't listen to those neanderthal whiners, the acting is fine, and it was not as gory as I expected, but did have some great bloody scenes, as it should!"
1427;i'd catagorize this more as a psychological thriller.
1428;In each of the mens' pockets is a micro tape with instructions on it.
1429;this is fun and creepy, in the end it fizzles out with the reason why, but other than that solid horror.
1430;"After countless raves from nearly every one of my horror film loving friends, I decided one day it was time for me to watch ""Saw,"" an indie slasher film premiering at the Sundance Film Festival as one of the ""Midnight Movies"" that is widely considered one of the greatest horror films of its generation."
1431;As the story unfolds, it suddenly explodes into a brilliantly twisted psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll after the shock ending and even for some time after that.
1432;Jigsaw is perfectly cast in his role.
1433;Very fortunately, the strong storyline and sheer terrifying simple atmosphere holds the film together.
1434;a very enjoyable movie watching experience, and it will scare the living daylights out of you if you watch it alone on a big screen with surround sound.
1435;Very good and much, much more and above and ultimately smarter and more brilliant the average super.
1436;I enjoy films ala Event Horizon or Hellraiser (I and II) much more.
1437;this movie does very well keeping you guessing.
1438;For that it kept my attention from stem to stern.
1439;the style of the movie .
1440;They did it well for what they were trying to go for.
1441;overall, its a decent movie.
1442;For that it wins points too.
1443;One of the best new horror sagas to launch in the last fifteen years .
1444;and maybe one of the best horror sagas of all time .
1445;jigsaw is ingenious and ruthless, preying on his victims's paranoias, their guilts, suspicions about one another (in cases where more than one person occupies the same trap) and fears about their loved ones on the outside.
1446;The angle of Jigsaw preying on those who he considers flawed and unappreciative of life, in order to teach them the value of being alive, is well.
1447;An excellent beginning for a series that's, so far, providing one of the year's top movies each October.
1448;I thought the story itself was really good and really interesting, however, I thought the acting was lacking.
1449;A lot of the five star reviews talk about the low budget and twist ending so let's address that first.
1450;take a shot for every time the boom mic appears).
1451;This movie is perhaps the best in the series.
1452;It has a lot of mystery and suspense.
1453;I personally like Danny Glover and he does a great job.
1454;The entire movie your trying to figure out who jigsaw is and that adds to the movie's greatness.
1455;"There are a lot of characters interacting around this ""game"" and that adds to the overall feel of desperation of this movie."
1456;This movie is a classic.
1457;This is a classic worth treasuring.
1458;While bloody, the film is also a psychological thriller as it examines the human need to survive, and what ethical boundaries one will cross in order to do so.
1459;Reminiscent of Battle Royale, the movie is filled with twists and turns until the final scene.
1460;There are some good ideas here but, as a whole, the movie doesn't quite hold together.
1461;It makes the movie Seven (a much better movie) seem downright wholesome, taking grimey ambiance to new lows.
1462;It is inventive and is generally entertaining.
1463;It was worth the wait.
1464;friendly for those who are too squeamish.
1465;You'll have a lot of fun trying to figure out the game in this movie, and when the ending comes you'll be quite surprised.
1466;I is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
1467;anyway the movies pretty cool i guess.
1468;the film succeeds with flying colours in its mission then, as noone will easily resist trying to find out who the evil game.
1469;The storyline is in danger of tipping over any single minute but this is a job ultimately well done.
1470;Aside of one single plot mistake (albeit sizey) that i spotted right at the very end, the rest of the film is actually rock.
1471;this is then the best asset of the film.
1472;"It's not just a mere ""whodunnit"" flick but also a very stylistic dark film that will surely enter the pantheon of great thrillers in recent time."
1473;the atmosphere keeps being in heavy competition with the excellent plot and in the end noone really cares who wins that contest.
1474;"The dialogue is up to par with the rest of the film and overall ""Saw"" wins the bet with itself in highly convincing fashion."
1475;If you were fascinated by the Usual Suspects and the Cube be sure to see this film.
1476;It will be right up your alley.
1477;This was an enjoyable addition to the horror genre.
1478;The guessing game the viewer must play with to regard to who the real jigsaw killer is keeps you guessing until the end.
1479;The story is very simple and gets straight to the point.
1480;One of the victims can kiss their loved ones goodbye.
1481;i mentioned the complicated traps.
1482;I originally bought the whole series for our son because he said Saw was a great movie.
1483;"More like a ""moral of the story"" plot."
1484;Usually the original film is well.
1485;raiing, fast paced, involving, and, blood.
1486;On one hand, this movie is incredibly raw and visceral.
1487;Part of the reason I liked this movie was because of the pacing.
1488;I found the movie to be expertly paced, with mounting tension and a lot of dread.
1489;There is a thread that holds everyone together and I found it incredibly fascinating.
1490;If you've seen Se7en, you'll understand a portion of what the movie has to offer.
1491;It's actually very surreal like Se7en and I think that movie is the closest I can compare to Saw.
1492;so, we have great pacing, good actors, an interesting (if ultimately unplausable in some spoiler aspects which I won't mention) story, good gore and some nice suspence.
1493;my other complaint with the climatic moment involving the title stems from a very sudden change in the character.
1494;But that is just a preference as a plot buff.
1495;It's in your face and visceral.
1496;An intense and horrifying movie, to say the least.
1497;The plot twists are very interesting and keep the audience on the edge of their seats.
1498;There were some cheesy lines, and the acting wasn't the best I've seen, but overall I would definitely recommend that you see Saw.
1499;You see a preview in the theatre one week, the next week you see it on TV a few times and two weeks later it's playing.
1500;Sure this won't be the greatest movie you'll see all year and it probably won't stand out in your mind as much as many others you'll see this year will (other than the gritty violence and the tense scenes), but it still stands a well thought, well directed film.
1501;instead of being a switch between two men stuck in a room and the events occuring with the other characters outside of it, the movie mixes it up some (and I believe this is one of it's major strong points).
1502;In between sequences of what's occuring in the present we see flashbacks of what the character's lives were like before and previous encounters of the Jigsaw Killer's madness.
1503;if you're going for a grizzly psycological thriller, by far your best bet is Seven.
1504;With a great ending and an intelligent and well though out plot, Saw definitely is one to catch in theatres.
1505;For a flick that will probably require multiple viewings to grasp everything there is to offer, Saw definitely ranks high up there.
1506;There are a few good shots in the film though.
1507;The twisty ending is okay, too.
1508;carey Elwes gets the wussiest performance of the year as the shackled doctor.
1509;Monica Potter is window dressing at best with a decent fight scene at the end.
1510;"I just got back from seeing ""Saw"" and I have to tell you, it's the best scary movie of the year and probably in some years!"
1511;"But let me tell you, ""Saw"" definitely did."
1512;The music, the way it was filmed, the mystery behind it.
1513;it was just so good, in my opinion.
1514;I advise that everyone go see it.
1515;There is (of course) a big twist at the end and it's definitely something you wouldn't expect.
1516;The 6 people that I ended up seeing it with all screamed throughout the movie as well as half of the rest of the theater.
1517;Saw is more of a real.
1518;life thriller as opposed to a ghost story.
1519;Step away from the computer and go see it, now!
1520;SAW really brings back the true HORROR in horror movies.
1521;This is a real good bloody, gruesome story that could frighten anyone.
1522;This is a film made by amateurs, and it shows.
1523;This film attempts to be clever, to make you think.
1524;"It is films/""art"" like this that help to create a less intelligent society."
1525;This is a superb horror film.
1526;Spawning multiple sequels, the original is still the best.
1527;"most ""award"" films are more drama films."
1528;This is a well thought out film.
1529;Seven, attempting to create a new kind of psychopathic serial killer and for the most part it succeeds.
1530;"The novice director Wan uses some excellent, hip cinematography to liven up the film and create some tense atmosphere, but ""Saw"" is never incredibly scary, but does keep you guessing until the very last frame."
1531;"A nice attempt for modern horror film standards, but films such as ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" did it much, much better."
1532;Saw is a better movie than most people give it credit for, mostly, I believe, because most people judge it as a horror movie.
1533;"I decided, after watching ""SAW 3"" this weekend, to give this movie another look."
1534;And that's just the actors.
1535;But the movie's concept is relatively slick .
1536;"(Incidentally, I feel ""Saw 2"" to be the best of the three films, and ""Saw 3"" a shade better than the original if only by benefit of better budget and better acting.)"
1537;elwes and Whannell give fine performances as the two men driven to the edge of sanity by their ordeal and one wishes that more time was spent building the tension between the two, rather than with so many flashback scenes.
1538;an effective thriller, more for the mood and settings than for the actual plot, but a well done effort.
1539;I got this to watch with my girlfriend to combat her chick.
1540;One of my favorite horror movies.
1541;The suspense builds throughout the movie and the death scenes are fairly chilling.
1542;I noticed some reviewers complained about Cary Elwes' over the top performance.
1543;which is the best serial killer horror movie of all time, in my opinion).
1544;The original Saw opens up with an interesting premise.
1545;First, because the flashbacks allow us to see Jigsaw's, the mysterious villain, more elaborate traps.
1546;there's a lot of nitpicking you could do on the first two.
1547;Let me repeat that: he works at a hospital.
1548;Jigsaw is actually a cancer patient we see for a total of three seconds during the movie.
1549;I should have guessed, it was right in front of me the whole time.
1550;If you really want to see a well done horror film that actually uses one set, go check out Cube.
1551;Saw is a great movie, all the sequels can be skipped.
1552;def video even in bright scenes.
1553;"He is testing their will to live trough his ""games"" which are traps that often necessitate the victims to lose a body part or to go to extremes."
1554;"saw became a phenomenon and in my opinion is one the best horror movie of the 2000s decade
1555;Whatever people may think about some of the sequels, the original one remains a great film and I think it's one of the best horror movies made.
1556;While I agree with that Assessment, I feel that Saw takes it up a notch and is even better than Seven.
1557;one Of The Strongest Points in this Film is that it isnt a Star Driven Movie, the biggest names in this Film are Danny Glover and Cary Elwes but the main Star of the Film is The Excellent Screenplay and the Mood that the Director sets.
1558;I dont want to go into details about the film because I dont want to give anything away but this Film is Well Worth Seeing!
1559;One Of The Best Thriller Films in years!
1560;Prepare yourself for a gut.
1561;wrenching trip into the heart of terror with SAW, Lions Gate Films' gripping horror film starring Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter and Leigh Whannell.
1562;director James Wan expertly spins this intricate tale, creating a chilling landscape of dread where nothing is quite as it seems.
1563;seat ride bristling with emotional intensity, SAW will keep you guessing until the very end.
1564;I enjoyed the movie and if you did too, I would recommend reading books by Richard Laymon.
1565;I was really surprised by this movie.
1566;I waited to see it until part 3 came out.
1567;I watched all three movies in one night and I was hooked!
1568;I'll just tell you if you're into thrillers, horror, or mysteries, watch SAW!
1569;Director James Wan and writer (and star) Leigh Whannel met each other at Australia, where they developed their friendship.
1570;now, the premise is intriguing.
1571;They cannot untie the chain, and the room is perfectly sealed.
1572;It is good, just good.
1573;I saw """"saw"""" the other noght and I loved it, it starts off just rite, the guys wakes up he's in a room chained up with another guy with a dead body in the room.4.7/5.0"""
1574;The dead guy holds a tape player and a handgun and each of the men has a tape in their back pocket.
1575;The idea of a gamemaster who doesn't actually kill anyone himself but lets them do what he wants them to, is an interesting concept.
1576;Danny Glover is a pleasure to watch on film and it was nice to see Cary Elwes again, even if his performance was terrible.
1577;overall, even though SAW is pretty much an average horror flick, it has enough sparks of originality to make it one cut above the rest.
1578;Definitely one of the smartest and best thriller in history.
1579;this movie proves that a good story and good script is far more importantthan a good budget (only $1 million).
1580;all the suspense, gruesome, witty elements are in the highest standard inmovie standard.
1581;"Cary Elwes what happened to great lines like ""hey great gift dad"""
1582;I think that every character in the movie is unique and interesting in their own way.
1583;This is the point, and I for one think that this is a great message to send the audience.
1584;"This movie definetly has a hint of ""Seven"" in it, but that's ok because that is another one of the greats in suspensful cinema."
1585;Saw is the first of this amazing franchise in horror and it's a goody.
1586;It's fresh, smart and keeps you guessing.
1587;"With a unique storyline complete with twists, surprises, puzzles and intense horror, ""Saw"" is movie that keeps you watching."
1588;Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell did a great job with this film.
1589;In the middle of the room lies the body of a man, a gun clutched in one hand and a tape player in the other.
1590;There's Paul, the suicidal man who comes face to face with razor wire.
1591;According to Jigsaw, he is giving Jeff's life a purpose.
1592;I for one, actually liked the acting, especially from Cary Elwes as the drama builds.
1593;I thought he did a great job displaying the intense pain, desperation, anger and feeling of helplessness.
1594;I really got into the emotion he brings to the film.
1595;He has a calmness, yet you feel his helplessness as well.
1596;He does a great job with some thrilling scenes in the film.
1597;Saw is a great horror movie will leave you questioning things every minute.
1598;The special effects are pretty good for a low.
1599;"It's intense, disturbing and horrific
1600;This is not a brilliant film, but it is good and it has made a ton of money.
1601;This little horror movie is full of tricks that'll grip you to your sofa.
1602;Behind the pictures and the clever.
1603;Saw is a refreshing change from the classic plot of the white face serial.
1604;This is by far the scarriest and most intense horror film that I've ever seen in my whole life.
1605;Watch this if you love horror films and have a tolerance for gore and violence.
1606;If you're looking for a good scare this is the movie you should see.
1607;Some instances of good camera work.
1608;it comes with 5 trailers and a music video.
1609;Now the movie is visually nice.
1610;all in all I give this movie 5 stars because the plot is brilliant.
1611;and the ending is soooooooooooooo unexpected that you'll find your self saying WOW once you see it.
1612;there's actual blood sealed inside the front, clear cover and it moves all around!!
1613;Hopefully the movie is as good (especially """"uncut"""") and creative as the package it came in."""
1614;octane character drama in the same vein as the wonderful CUBE.
1615;trap and the key in the dead man is brilliantly realised, I admit.)
1616;"It will probably catch most by surprise
1617;Watch it, instead, for something unique to rub elbows with all the carbon.
1618;Acting, for one, is definately at best B. grade (that's being nice, too).
1619;new and talk with friends about.
1620;if you manage to look past the gruesome violence of this movie, what lies beneath is actually a very intelligent crime film, like a really good episode of """"Law and Order"""" or """"NYPD Blue"""", just with harsher graphic content."""
1621;this movie also shows us the villain's ideals.
1622;a lot of the movie is also a flashback to the police.
1623;But what this movie lacks in the heavier gore of its sequels, it makes up for in its exciting suspense and smart film.
1624;but anyway, if you want a great horror movie, mixed in with some crime and thriller elements, give this a shot.
1625;Thanks for the time, and peace.
1626;SAW is a welcome relief to the serial killer film genre.
1627;It is both clever and interesting.
1628;There is a lot to take in, but that is a good thing.
1629;video film but impressed the right people and gained a cinema run world.
1630;you can't use that type of language here at Amazon but I'll just go with it.
1631;regarding the film itself, it's phenomenal, such a simple plot, but when in the hands of James Wan (Writer and Director) and Leigh Whannell ('Adam' and Writer).
1632;It's transformed into this thriller that will keep your eyes fixed to the screen, just waiting to discover what happens next.
1633;understand that such statements above are opinionated and if you disagree then so be it.
1634;I love movies that no nobody survive in them!
1635;If you think like me, this is your movie!
1636;The movieended up being one of the more unique horror movies I have seen in quite a while.
1637;I give it four stars.
1638;I checked it out and thought that it was really worth the watch.
1639;But overall good stuff, liked the filming and directing alot.
1640;One of those movies where you got to sit there and pay good attention.
1641;But there WAS blood, and thats what made it good.
1642;I have never seen a movie with a better end.
1643;Every now and then a horror movie emerges from the underground, made by a fine bunch of young people, who all share a genuin enthusiasm for the genre in general and for some new hot ideas in particular.
1644;"The result: ""The evil dead"", a funny, sparkling and nasty little horrorflick with some powerhouse inventive camerawork, created mainly out of budget limitations."
1645;cheeck, that you are more than happy to go along with.
1646;The young men are bound by physical chains and by a whole bunch of mental ones.
1647;paranoia, blood, gutted humor, plot twists, sawed of limbs, buddy.
1648;things, and mind bending puzzeling to go along, and all slick but juicyful put together with dazzeling camerawork, fast paced editing and chilly atmosphere, giving us the same feeling as the audience got when they saw the above mentionend grand daddy's in this genre.
1649;Saw brings life into the Horror movie genre.
1650;Saw is either my first or second favorite horror movie of all time.
1651;"Another thing that makes ""Saw"" a fantastic movie is the music."
1652;if you are a fan of Horror movies you will love this film !
