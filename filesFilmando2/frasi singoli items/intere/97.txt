I:9518;2;"The movie ""Zodiac"" is also a better movie."
I:9518;3;This is the original of all the five movies they made about crime and the Inspector Harry Callahan.
I:9518;4;He sends her teeth through the mail to verify that he has her.
I:9518;5;Eastwood was good in playing Harry tough.
I:9518;6;So let's just say this is a great movie.
I:9518;7;There is a reason everyone loves it.
I:9518;8;It's well written, well acted, and an all around great film.
I:9518;9;And some of our most memorable quotes come from this film.
I:9518;10;I know what you're thinking.
I:9518;11;A classic movie of a cop who stops at nothing to rid his city of thugs and criminals.
I:9518;12;If you like antihero cop stories or are a Clint Eastwood fan, you'll enjoy this movie!
I:9518;13;Some parts make my skin crawl but it is still great fun.
I:9518;14;order cop, there are flashes of a more complex human being just below that surface.
I:9518;15;The first thing that took me by surprise was the fact that the sound was so great.
I:9518;16;This is the best cop movie I have ever seen.
I:9518;17;No, it's clear that Callahan, with impeccably coiffed hair and those cool shades, is more concerned about his appearance than he is about keeping the peace.
I:9518;18;"This leads to a classic Eastwood line, spoken with an impish grin: ""."
I:9518;19;top nervousness to appear sinister.
I:9518;20;wise may be the liquor store scene.
I:9518;21;the central plot of DIRTY HARRY is simple yet effective.
I:9518;22;barrelled gun, triumph and we fade out after a wateryHIGH NOONmoment.
I:9518;23;over 40 years later DIRTY HARRY holds up magnificently.
I:9518;24;Few cop dramas have ever been as good as the one with Dirty Harry Callahan.
I:9518;25;"Played unforgettably by Clint Eastwood, the character remains one of the most memorable characters in screen history and the chord struck by his films still rings true to this day.1971's ""Dirty Harry"" is the first of five Dirty Harry films, and to this day is still considered the best of the series by just about everyone."
I:9518;26;This all leads to an explosive climax involving a school bus full of screaming children and a gripping chase through the backroads of San Francisco.
I:9518;27;Dirty Harry still remains the quintessential cop thriller to this day.
I:9518;28;Its message still rings true, and the character has long been proven to not just be a product of its time.
I:9518;29;"Andrew Robinson's character, Scorpio, turns in a performance like no other
I:9518;30;But the kudos must go the world.
I:9518;31;Clint Eastwood turns in an extraordinary performance as the cool and remorseless Calahan.
I:9518;32;Thirty years on DIRTY HARRY still ranks as one of THE coolest movies of all time.
I:9518;33;in the viewer is completely hooked and your heart will remain in your mouth throughout.
I:9518;34;Clint gives his most famous performance as trigger happy San Francisco cop Harry Callahan who is on the trail of a coldblooded sniper, known to the police only by his codename: Scorpio.
I:9518;35;This is unquestionably the best of the series stylish, slick, funny, tough violent.
I:9518;36;faced Clint takes on a raving lunatic in this excellent police thriller.
I:9518;37;All in all, a very good video despite very vague (though still worrying) tyrannical undertones to Harry's all.
I:9518;38;excellent music by fellow countryman, Lalo Schifrin.
I:9518;39;What can I possibly add to the volumes of praise that this classic has so richly earned over the years?

I:9518;41;but he also shoots first and then asks questions.

I:9518;43;When everyone was taking sides in 1971, both the actor and the director were smart enough to see the ambiguities and leave them unanswered.
I:9518;44;"It has aged well
I:9518;45;There are 3 reasons why this film works:1.
I:9518;46;There is effective use of S. f. locales(one of the best scenes takes place right on the field of Keezar Stadium).
I:9518;47;there is rapid fire editing and excellent cinematography that, at times, seems almost filmed in a documentary style(giving this picture more of a sense of realism such as in the contemporary COPS T. v. shows).
I:9518;48;atmospheric music by Lalo Schifrin adds to the excitement.
I:9518;49;i love this movie as well as the entire collection.
I:9518;50;take action and deliver justice.
I:9518;51;one of the best crime movies of all time.
I:9518;52;a cop you love and a main criminal whose annoying personality make watching him get it at the end sooooooo much fun.
I:9518;53;One the most classic crime dramas.
I:9518;54;Dirty Harry marked both a pop culture and artistic high water mark for star Clint Eastwood (who finally had another persona in which to replace his man with no name) as well as director Don Siegel.
I:9518;55;An essential thriller best viewed in the widescreen format for full effect.
I:9518;56;it always has been on my top 10 lists.
I:9518;57;McQueen should have won an Oscar for that performance.
I:9518;58;"But ""Bullit"" was fascinating from start to finish."
I:9518;59;"Bullit is the real deal and deserves the moniker of ""iconic""."
I:9518;60;Like a superb wine, it just keeps getting better.
I:9518;61;Despite some controversy over police brutality and victims' rights, this is a riveting police action thriller.
I:9518;62;Harry is an engaging character with wonderful one liners and a laconic calm in the face of mayhem.
I:9518;63;Scorpio is such a scumbag that we never seem to question Harry's unorthodox methods, and there are some wonderful scenes with him butting heads with his superiors.
I:9518;64;Followed by four worthy sequels.
I:9518;65;disc Special Collector's Edition), and figured I should see it.
I:9518;66;despite that, though, and despite the fact that I'm as liberal as liberal gets, I still liked the movie.
I:9518;67;I loved some of the choices the director made, seeing Clint Eastwood is always a thrill, and it was really fascinating to see Andrew Robinson in the days before he became Garak onStar Trek Deep Space Nine .
I:9518;68;A movie of triumph over the injustices in the world, and a perfect example of how our judicial system is not always a shining gem of life and light.
I:9518;69;This film provides a unique insight into a very interesting character.
I:9518;70;It just presents us with a man who, yes, takes the law into his own hands.
I:9518;71;made film, certainly the best of the Dirty Harry series.
I:9518;72;The soundtrack, written by Lalo Schifrin, is wonderfully haunting, and Don Siegel's direction is crisp and taut.
I:9518;73;Eastwood is great as the bitter, angst.
I:9518;74;This movie hits home on every level.
I:9518;75;I liked its live action style.
I:9518;76;i wanted to mention the awesome performance of Andy Robinson as Scorpio the serial killer.
I:9518;77;A credit to the company who released it.
I:9518;78;The extras are also terrific, especially a short documentary by the late Robert Urich who had a part in the second Dirty Harry film Magnum Force .
I:9518;79;now that's a sign of a great film.
I:9518;80;It's sharp and gritty, and the dialogue is tough enough to break your speakers.
I:9518;81;i know he has done somany great films,but this is the one I'll alwaysremember him for.
I:9518;82;But alas there's more, fromDon Siegal's superb direction and Lilo Shiffren'sterrific score to Andrew Robinson's performance andwhat a performance(where's the OSCAR).
I:9518;83;also I recommend from the manthese great titles PLAY MISTY FOR ME.
I:9518;84;this was a decent movie, im a big fan of Clint Eastwood so I liked it, though I can't say the same for the rest of the cast.
I:9518;85;What can I say its Clint Eastwood at his absolute finest and the last remnant of the hollowood cowboy,enough said
I:9518;86;"entertaining ""Dirty Harry"" cop series and it was a good one ."
I:9518;87;maybe the best of the series.
I:9518;88;"Speaking of punks, Andy Robinson, who played the villain, never got famous as Clint Eastwood (""Harry"") certainly became but he was tremendous in this film."
I:9518;89;He actually got support from his bosses in this movie.
I:9518;90;And it's always nice to enjoy theinteresting San Francisco skyline.
I:9518;91;Cop flicks usually bore me, but this is one of the best.
I:9518;92;There are so many outstanding scenes, that it is anything but predictable.
I:9518;93;Eastwood is great as the savvy but cynical cop, and Andy Robinson makes everything go as the villain.
I:9518;94;I'm now almost 42, and it's still one of my 100 favorite films number 17 to be exact.
I:9518;95;I feel it was proper to pay tribute to the City of San Francisco's finest at the beginning of the movie, and then it's down to business.
I:9518;96;I feel what made this a classic was the fact that it was the first one ever done, and it introduced movies to the homicidal maniac.
I:9518;97;"I know that this equals with the film ""The Hitchhiker"" as the most intense film ever."
I:9518;98;I also like the way it was filmed on location in San Francisco, and maybe one of these days I will actually take a trip there.
I:9518;99;"All around one of Clint's classics, and prepped him for his directorial debut in ""Play Misty For Me""."
I:9518;100;The first of five Dirty Harry movies was definitely the best in the series.
I:9518;101;one noteworthy sequence involves Harry introducing crooks to his weapon of choice.
I:9518;102;"He gives them this memorable spiel: ""I know what you're thinking."
I:9518;103;Another is Lalo Schifrin's music, which captures the mood of the lively action scenes down to the sobering notes at the film's denouement.
I:9518;104;And Andrew Robinson as Scorpio is pretty chilling in a mixture of cleverness and downright insanity.
I:9518;105;It's of little irony that Scorpio sports a belt buckle with a distorted peace sign.
I:9518;106;Director Don Siegel films the action in a gritty style and the story is a non.
I:9518;107;all we need is a benevolent facist to take care of us and we'll be alright.
I:9518;108;This film is a revenge fantasy that plays on our basest instincts.
I:9518;109;"but once you get beyond that, ""Dirty Harry"" is a timeless classic."
I:9518;110;Now that Eastwood is finally getting some respect from Hollywood with Oscar's and other award nominations, it's fun to go back and see his earlier films.
I:9518;111;Pick that up instead and enjoy an entire weekend of Harry Callahan.
I:9518;112;First Clint Eastwood(who was the best choice for this one) and Andrew Robinson are fantastic in it.
I:9518;113;The direction is very good but not great and it does have a very intense sequences(the opening and endings scenes are both great).
I:9518;114;"This is definatelty in the top five best cop movies ever and who can forget the ""six shots or only five"" line."
I:9518;115;He is a good cop that has been so hardened by his environment that has almost no remorse.
I:9518;116;"He knows the city is a jungle and its ""kill or be killed""."
I:9518;117;Andrew Robinson is just as good as the insane psychopath Scorpio.
I:9518;118;He is the one great ingredient the rest of the Dirty Harry movies lacked, a great bad guy.
I:9518;119;some people see the film as a call to fascism.
I:9518;120;It will definately make you want to talk about it.
I:9518;121;I'm not the kind of viewer that some people would identify as a fan of Dirty Harry (I'm a proud liberal who always votes Democratic and who owns no weapons) but I love this film without reservations.
I:9518;122;First, let's give it up for Don Siegel, one of the best US directors of the post.
I:9518;123;The man knew how to make a movie.
I:9518;124;rate craftsmanship that never calls too much attention to itself.
I:9518;125;Yes, he's a damn good actor and that's mainly because he doesn't ACT.
I:9518;126;Siegel also gets solid acting across the board from his veteran cast, and with the help of Andy Robinson, who's as over the top as Clint is restrained, gives us one of the best, most vile villains committed to celluloid.
I:9518;127;There are interesting psychological dimensions to the film and I found myself wondering if Scorpio represents everything Harry represses and fears in himself, taken to a hideous extreme.
I:9518;128;a. kind look for Siegel's classic, with his inky San Francisco nightscapes making the hunt for Scorpio as strangely beautiful as it is unnerving.
I:9518;129;Dismissing this movie as reactionary, right.
I:9518;130;P. s. the set is beautifully packaged with great extras at a reasonable price.
I:9518;131;this affords a nice opportunity to see the difference between the two formats.
I:9518;132;and those are his good points.
I:9518;133;But as with all Dirty Harry movies, he does it with style.
I:9518;134;This is escapist entertainment at it's very best.
I:9518;135;i wont recommend this at all.
I:9518;136;certainly not enough to light up my movie world.
I:9518;137;And it succeeds in doing just that.
I:9518;138;But the film goes deeper than that, and this is what I find most compellingly interesting about it.
I:9518;139;It is the first police drama of its time to raise pertinent questions/issues regarding its socially redeeming value , for example.
I:9518;140;mary Deacon, a fourteen year.
I:9518;141;A great film, and a compassionate one in its own right.
I:9518;142;Andrew Robinson plays the psychopath Charles `Scorpio' Davis, and is scaringly convincing in the role.
I:9518;143;An exciting film and very satisfying to see killers getting the punishment they deserve .
I:9518;144;Dirty Harry has a straight.
I:9518;145;"Dirty Harry has a couple of classic scenes at its beginning and end, in which Callahan gets to use his signature ""do you feel lucky"" speech while a suspect stares down the barrel of his .44 magnum handgun."
I:9518;146;Dirty Harry is highly recommended to Clint Eastwood fans.
I:9518;147;It's still a good gripping yarn though gratuitously bloody here and there.
I:9518;148;Dirty Harry Callahan is one of those iconic characters that stands apart from the crowd.
I:9518;149;"And he certainly lives up to the legend in Dirty Harry,"" a grimy cop thriller where morals are grey and justice isn't always served by the law."
I:9518;150;The serial killer is so enraged that he rapes and buries a young girl alive, and threatens the police with her death if they don't give in to his demands.
I:9518;151;harry is sent on a wild chase through San Francisco with a giant bag of money, and eventually is able to corner and stop the Scorpio killer (Andrew Robinson).
I:9518;152;and now he's determined to frame Harry as revenge.
I:9518;153;Dirty Harry actually has a very simple story, loosely based on the Zodiac killings in the 1970s.
I:9518;154;The really memorable part of the movie is the presentation .
I:9518;155;and a lot of that comes from Eastwood himself.
I:9518;156;His performance as Callahan is the stuff of cinematic legend .
I:9518;157;What matters most to him is saving innocent lives and stopping the killer, and sometimes he has to step outside the law to do so.
I:9518;158;"And it has a strong feeling of realism, even during the more ""Hollywood"" scenes ."
I:9518;159;It's especially scary because we've seen innocent people killed by this maniac, so we know he's perfectly capable of hurting the children.
I:9518;160;not only does it introduce us to the gritty anti.
I:9518;161;This picture is a standalone classic of American film making that has move in common with The Conversation and Taxi Driver than it does with Lethal Weapon.
I:9518;162;heroic portait of a cop I think it holds up better than French Connection.
I:9518;163;virtually invented the realistic serial killer genre.
I:9518;164;this is his best film and it's never looked this good, partly because it's never looked this dim.
I:9518;165;His work is completely thrilling and the portraits of both cop and killer he creates are filled with provactive ideas.
I:9518;166;At those moments it's clear from Clint's face that he knows he and the killer have much in common.
I:9518;167;He's completely believable and there's no ironic wit or psychological justification.
I:9518;168;His performance is still terrifying, it hasn't dated at all and it stands as one of the great screen performances of all time.
I:9518;169;(He gets a great assist from Lalo's sensational score.)
I:9518;170;No one is born to play a movie role .
I:9518;171;Possibly one of the most influential movies of all time.
I:9518;172;"While Clint Eastwood drew on earlier influences from westerns of the early 20th century, Dirty Harry is the classic ""American cowboy""."
I:9518;173;Though they tried and tried and tried, this is the best of the set.
I:9518;174;Great setting, using a positively magic city as backdrop (coincidence that this and Bullitt, the two best cop films of the era were both set in San Francisco?
I:9518;175;this film alone (even if Harrys 2,3,and 4 were never shown) made the persona of one of the most memorable characters in American film.
I:9518;176;dirty harry is one of my favority movie characters, right up there with don vito from the godfather II.
I:9518;177;Super music, a great performance by Eastwood, but an even better one by Andy Robinson as Scorpio!
I:9518;178;Scorpio was told the consequences of feeling lucky against the Magnum, but he just laughed and was blown into the stagnant pond!
I:9518;179;The cream always rises to the top and the fact that this film is still among many people's favourite detective flicks and from which many scenes and elements have been copied by other flicks over the years shows that this film is a classic to stand the test of time.
I:9518;180;"Even the overall mood of this film reminded me a little of ""Silence of the Lambs"" as well."
I:9518;181;"This was a perfect film that was very well directed and Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry was excellent casting
I:9518;182;This classic deserves a lot better than this and I'm hoping the newly released Blu.
I:9518;183;Dirty Harry is a fine movie and we both enjoyed it.
I:9518;184;I got a chuckle out of his tough.
I:9518;185;In any case, it was an interesting movie regarding the rise and demise of a serial killer and was nicely put together.
I:9518;186;I particularly enjoyed viewing mid.70s San Francisco.
I:9518;187;It was an excellent movie.
I:9518;188;I have liked this movie since I was a kid.
I:9518;189;information Diry Harry fans will enjoy.
I:9518;190;packed this movie definitely is.
I:9518;191;The plot certainly has many exciting twists and turns as the elusive villain (Andy Robinson) is able to dodge a conviction because Eastwood's anger gets the best of him.
I:9518;192;whereas Clint Eastwood was his usual striking self, Robinson fit the role of the villain like a hand in a glove.
I:9518;193;Dirty Harry is a an even better movie now in 2011,than when it came out in 1971.
I:9518;194;this is Clint Eastwood at his best!!
I:9518;195;Don Siegel's DIRTY HARRY has stood the test of time and remains a classic film based on the mores of a modern society tempered with logical judgment of how to dispense justice to those unlawful individuals in that society.
I:9518;196;While DIRTY HARRY is truely the hour of the .44 Magnum, the film is one of Hollywood's greatest thrillers and it birthed a character to be emulated but never equaled.
I:9518;197;DIRTY HARRY is a film of incredible suspense, with Donald Siegel's direction becoming a benchmark for the genre.
I:9518;198;The movie's legacy is well documented: Sinatra, McQueen, Newman and The Duke, turned it down.
I:9518;199;The Bruce Surtees photograhy is stunning.
I:9518;200;This is a great film, one of Clint's best and the best film in the Dirty Harry series.
I:9518;201;It's intelligent, exciting, and funny as hell.
I:9518;202;It's politically incorrect, and that's a damn good thing.
I:9518;203;Life is politically incorrect, and that's a damn good thing also.
I:9518;204;He likes to work alone.
I:9518;205;eastwood sets the tone and stage for his many resurrections.
I:9518;206;It holds up well over the years and reflects the sentiment at the time of being tough in general and especially with the criminal element.
I:9518;207;a lot of people like to see this kind of no nonsense guy which I think accounts for much of it's appeal.
I:9518;208;What can one say about the first and by far best of the Dirty Harry set of movies.
I:9518;209;From the original score to the camera work, right through to character development and of course Dirty Harry Callaghan himself Clint Eastwood, this movie has it all!
I:9518;210;A throughly enjoyable movie and one of the best in the police dramas ever made.
I:9518;211;Dirty Harry always gets his man!
I:9518;212;And Dirty Harry is even better when weighed against the zeitgeist of the early 70s.
I:9518;213;"Even John Wayne took note of Dirty Harry's success, and created the lesser, but still eminently watchable, ""McQ"" in response."
I:9518;214;Dirty Harry (1971), as an action film, is quite unique and definitely in the upper echelon of the genre.
I:9518;215;The reasons for its success, on a purely technical level, can be found in the direction, cinematography, and editing ( the latter maximizing the laser like focus of the plotline ).
I:9518;216;Director Don Siegel's excellent work is a model of how to maximize the potential of location shooting.
I:9518;217;lalo Schifrin's haunting musical score fits the film like a glove.
I:9518;218;"with regard to acting, Clint Eastwood ( with typically effective subtlety ) gives just enough hints of Inspector Harry Callahan's interior life (a widower, wearily independent detective, sympathetic to the ""common"" man ) to allow the viewer to fill in the rest of the details."
I:9518;219;"In a chilling and critically important scene ( an effective emblem of ironic ""displacement"" ) ""Scorpio"" wears a belt buckle modeled as a ""peace sign"" while smilingly looking over a playground full of the same kinds of children he has recently murdered."
I:9518;220;"since it is so often brought up, it is proper to spend a few moments on certain ""political"" objections raised about the film."
I:9518;221;"to conclude: ""Dirty Harry"" is a brilliant action film."
I:9518;222;If excitement is all one needs, the film delivers in spectacular fashion.
I:9518;223;"If one wishes to ""probe"" further, it also works as a ( humble ) meditation on our ""fallen"" world and ( necessarily ) imperfect human justice."
I:9518;224;It was a very much a movie of the time and place .
I:9518;225;this was the first major role for Clint Eastwood in American films (although he made many fans in his portrayals of the man with no name in Italian films) and he took full advantage of his opportinity with an very good performance in his role as Detective Harry Callahan.
I:9518;226;this a very good film that highlights issues still relavent today .
I:9518;227;studded cast, but employs veteran supporting actors like John Vernon and Harry Guardino who give solid performances.
I:9518;228;Clint Eastwood plays Callahan to the hilt and made quite an impression with his acting ability.
I:9518;229;this is a very good film and deserves to be a classic.
I:9518;230;Several people feel this film is politically incorrect in several ways, but keep in mind this film was made before politically correct was being used as a phrase.
I:9518;231;This film is not the best crime picture ever but I believe its one of the best.
I:9518;232;eastwood plays Detective Harry Callahan on the San Fransico Police Dept. He handles cases in a very violent way, which could be construed as unesesary but it is a classic Eastwood action film, and what is an action film without it's fair share of violence?To me the two best things about this movie is the cinematography and the ending.
I:9518;233;The camera in this film makes you feel like you are behind Dirty Harry the entire duration of the film.
I:9518;234;The ending is very well done but I won't give it away.
I:9518;235;The [$] price is well worth this Clint Eastwood masterpiece, if you can wade through Harry's body count without being offended.
I:9518;236;Now, the maverick detective is determined to nail the maniac himself.
I:9518;237;The film was certainly a right.
I:9518;238;clint Eastwood makes more politically correct films nowadays and, for so doing, is rewarded with glowing reviews and academy awards.
I:9518;239;But the film Dirty Harry makes a powerful statement and I think stands out as Clint Eastwood's greatest film.
I:9518;240;The classic original 1971 Dirty Harry on Blu Ray,great PQ,sound and extras!!!
I:9518;241;FYI,this is also included as part of The Dirty Harry Blu Ray box set!
I:9518;242;There is a case to be made that this show is a political statement.
I:9518;243;Give him 200,000 bucks and a plane ride to wherever he wants to go?
I:9518;244;This is a very solid intro into the Dirty Harry series, featuring The Scorpio Killer.
I:9518;245;"The film also establishes the Dirty Harry myth and, most importantly, provides the answer as to why he's called ""Dirty Harry."
I:9518;246;Throughout the film,we slowly come to understand Harry but not completely.
I:9518;247;"I like the line he uses in this film, ""Do you feel lucky?"
I:9518;248;There are many funny moments in this film.
I:9518;249;I first got it on tape way back in the early '80's on Beta.
I:9518;250;Now the newest edition is better than ever,being digitally processed,letterboxed,in Dolby Surround,so it looks and sounds terrific.
I:9518;251;now I can really appreciate Bruce Surtees' great cinematography.
I:9518;252;all under the late great Don Siegel's masterful direction.
I:9518;253;I love all the Dirty Harry movies but I feel this one is still the best.
I:9518;254;It illustrates the classic tension between the law and what someone will go to to save a life.
I:9518;255;This movie established an enduring character that has in so many ways entered our cultural lexicon with his quotes.
I:9518;256;Director Don Siegel's gritty realism works to reincarnate the classic John Wayne hero image.
I:9518;257;The sound seems great to me (admittedly I'm not a tech guy, so sorry about that), and I was able to notice things that I had never seen in the old standard.
I:9518;258;ray, I'd say this is good enough to recommend, and if you're new to the film what are you waiting for?!
I:9518;259;Dirty Harry What A Classic gritty movie, Great lines, Great Action and basically a social commentary on how the world has gone down the tubes.
I:9518;260;This movie is one of the best movies of all time.
I:9518;261;cO. uK REVIEWSThey say first is always best and never has that been more true than here.
I:9518;262;But thanks to a brilliant turn by ANDY ROBINSON as the lip.
I:9518;263;Not so much 'cake and and eat it' as knife and twist it.
I:9518;264;affirming just what the 'Dirty' prefix means as a bottom line definition.
I:9518;265;paced direction ensures that there's a very real sense of tension in the race to rescue a young girl (kidnapped and subsequently buried alive by Scorpio) and prevent her from dying by suffocation.
I:9518;266;A terrifically downbeat ending is a reminder that those who are supposed to protect and serve occasionally cross the line and that sometimes it simply has to be that way.
I:9518;267;Brings to the fore composer LALO SCHIFRIN's cool and very 70's score.
I:9518;268;a brilliant film, in it's best possible showcase.
I:9518;269;This is a movie classic.
I:9518;270;(Hey, I'd love to see a kid get away with that today!)
I:9518;271;"I loved the ""Dirty Harry"" series of films, but my favorite has always been the Don Siegel directed, 1971 original, ""Dirty Harry""."
I:9518;272;When Harry can no longer make sense of the laws he's suppose to uphold, he relies on his own code and takes matters into his own hands.
I:9518;273;I think one of the things that elevates this film above the others in the series is just how good the villian is.
I:9518;274;Yes, Clint Eastwood created an iconic character.
I:9518;275;But for every 'ying' you gotta have that 'yang'.
I:9518;276;Actor, Andy Robinson, in an underrated performance, has masterfully created one of the great villians of the cinema.
I:9518;277;(Thank goodness, Harry shows up on that bridge!)
I:9518;278;This film features Don Siegel's wonderful direction, which is cinematically both taunt and suspenseful.
I:9518;279;The action scenes are brilliantly set up and even after over thirty years of repeated viewings still hold up.
I:9518;280;Classic action at its best!
I:9518;281;The picture looks amazing and the sound is crystal clear for a film from 1971.
I:9518;282;Despite this, I'm still happy with this freshly scrubbed new edition.
I:9518;283;I love the broken glass, graphic style slip case and really enjoyed revisiting this classic action film from my childhood.
I:9518;284;Just a good, classic Clint Eastwood movie.
I:9518;285;"This new addition of ""Dirty Harry"" comes out with the other four movies."
I:9518;286;second, the movie is clever.
I:9518;287;Andy Robinson is great as Scorpio.
I:9518;288;The one liners from Eastwood are delivered wonderfully.
I:9518;289;instead, watch it for the witty dialogue, great scene staging, and Eastwood as a tough cop who is out to protect the innocent .
I:9518;290;It is a wild film of a tough cop, tracking down a serial killer.
I:9518;291;Clint Eastwood fans will like it the most.
I:9518;292;lt is one that my husband likes to watch over and over again.
I:9518;293;Both films cemented the careers of their stars .
I:9518;294;Dirty Harry is a suspense picture, building to the final climaxes steadily.
I:9518;295;Eastwood makes the picture one you'll want in your collection.
I:9518;296;It's worth checking out again!
I:9518;297;Eastwood is perfectly cast as the cop, rogue by some standards, who has only one goal: stop a madman.
I:9518;298;"Great movie
I:9518;299;I remember i liked it before and i still like it after watching it again.
I:9518;300;Who i think is a great composer.
I:9518;301;The music was also good in the Center speaker.
I:9518;302;but i was happy the times they was used.
I:9518;303;For many of us living in that era, it appeared that the justice system was geared to protecting criminals more than their victims.
I:9518;304;when we meet Harry at the beginning of the movie, we are privy to an incident that predates the present story.
I:9518;305;I personally liked Harry from that point and I suspect so did most audience members.
I:9518;306;harry and his partner continue to pursue the Scorpio Killer, convincingly played by veteran actor Andrew Robinson.
I:9518;307;with the benefit of four decades of movie.
I:9518;308;"making, we can see that ""Dirty Harry"" was a new class of police officer who led the way for legions of police officers frustrated with a cumbersome justice system that adheres to the rules so completely that it forgets to get justice."
I:9518;309;The extras, which are very good, make this observation in detail.
I:9518;310;"two extras I particularly liked were ""Dirty Harry's Way"" and ""Dirty Harry: The Original."""
I:9518;311;Dirty Harry remains a highly original ground breaking movie that made way for dozens of others.
I:9518;312;I have watched this movie many times and hopefully will watch it many more times.
I:9518;313;"It is one of the great movies, making a number of ""best of"" lists."
I:9518;314;Eastwod does some good acting as does the villain who is crazy as sh.
I:9518;315;t. Overall this is a incredible cop/actionmovie for any fans of Eastwood or action films.
I:9518;316;Even for its time it still looks good compared to other movies its age.
I:9518;317;The plot was realistic and great
I:9518;318;I've always liked the Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry series of movies, saw them when they first came out and can still watch them all these years later and get a kick out of them!
I:9518;319;Worth it simply for Eastwood's iconic performance and Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack.
I:9518;320;These scenes between Harry and Scorpio are chilling in their brutality.
I:9518;321;There are two scenes of note that relate to this conflict.
I:9518;322;the movie ends with a message that crime and its Dirty Harry type supression is more important than law and its proper and sometimes inefficient use of that suppression.
I:9518;323;I've had big fun over the years with that and still like to watch the movie too.
I:9518;324;Great lines (even though it's not the most powerful handgun in the world and wasn't then either.)
I:9518;325;it's still a lot of fun to shoot.
I:9518;326;While enforcing the law he constantly keeps having runins with the people in charge.
I:9518;327;Harry's big struggle with the killer goes to the final.
I:9518;328;The movie has outstanding actors and the action is nonstop.
I:9518;329;Watch this video to see an all time classic.
I:9518;330;This was a great film all.
I:9518;331;Filled with suspense, action and mystery.
I:9518;332;Clint Eastwood is amazing in his tough cop role.
I:9518;333;it's just a simple story .
I:9518;334;This has to be Clint Eastwood's second best movie.
I:9518;335;The plot flows perfectly with the story.
I:9518;336;If you like cop movies with an interesting plot, this is the one for you.
I:9518;337;eastwood's performance as Harry Callahan is unfettered by conventional techniques and he dominates this movie, along with a psychotically perfect Andrew Robinson as the demented Scorpio Killer.
I:9518;338;The first in the five Harry movies, this is one of the best of its kind.
I:9518;339;Dirty Harry was and remains a landmark in American film, the best.
I:9518;340;director Don Siegel and his cinematographers use the subtleties of circa.1971 San Francisco to extract powerfully effective stylization as well as gritty, realistic tension in the flow of the plot, such as when Harry and Chico stake out the church of a threatened priest and a gunfight erupts with Scorpio.
I:9518;341;and the resourceful punk even gets himself beaten up to try and frame Harry.
I:9518;342;'Dirty Harry' is a classic movie that has stood the test of time.
I:9518;343;liners alone make this movie a classic.
I:9518;344;Harry Callaghan (a grand Irish name!)
I:9518;345;He's basically a good, intelligent cop, but with no time for the niceties of procedure.
I:9518;346;Well you'll have to watch the film.
I:9518;347;The story line is gripping, and it'll keep you interested all the way.
I:9518;348;There are plenty of twists and turns, lots of action, drama, and tragedy.
I:9518;349;but what is really good about this film is the cinematography.
I:9518;350;When you see this film, you'll see the genesis of all the 70's cop shows that this style spawned .
I:9518;351;It can't all be sweetness and light, and this film shows you some of the other side.
I:9518;352;Truly, a classic of its time!
I:9518;353;Inspector Harry Callahan is a character created primarily by Clint Eastwood in what may be an extension of his man.
I:9518;354;Director Don Siegel in actuality creates 2 additional characters that are always in place in the series.
I:9518;355;This was truly Clint Eastwood's finest moments.
I:9518;356;His personality in this one is unique from all other LA cop movies.
I:9518;357;Lines like do you feel lucky punk ?
I:9518;358;In the future I always counted the number of shots he took although the only time it matter was in the Dead Pool when the guy was threatening him and he said Your out of bullets .
I:9518;359;The 70's were a fun time!
I:9518;360;It also gave us a very important icon Dirty Harry!
I:9518;361;One of the best pictures of it's kind.
I:9518;362;Clint is money baby as Harry, also Andy Robinson is to be commended for the terrific and convincing job he did as the Scorpion Killer!
I:9518;363;Japanese baby boomer will definitely appreciate Warner's great effort.
I:9518;364;This is one of the best presentation of American movie in '70s.
I:9518;365;First and foremost, the picture has been nicely remastered, as has the film's audio track.
I:9518;366;Some of the special features here aren't really anything new, but there are quite enough here to hold your attention.
I:9518;367;Most notably is the new Long Shadow of Dirty Harry documentary, which offers quite a bit of depth and retrospection on the film's history and impact over the past three decades plus.
I:9518;368;Other features, including various interviews, two small featurettes, a trailer gallery for all five Dirty Harry films, an insightful commentary from Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel, and an old tribute/biography to Eastwood round out the solid features here.
I:9518;369;"Such is the assertion made boldly and impertinently by Detective Harry Callahan to the San Francisco D. a in ""Dirty Harry"", perhaps the greatest urban cop thriller ever made."
I:9518;370;such austere ambiguity can be ascribed only to the filmmaker, the inimitable Don Siegel, as taut and mature a director as Hollywood has ever produced.
I:9518;371;"mcCarthyist, or if ""Coogan's Bluff"" is an indictment of New York hippiedom, the opposing sides lose sight of what is so truly great in each movie."
I:9518;372;My favorite Clint Eastwood movie is the one where he goes back to the past to rescue doc and he's in the old west!
I:9518;373;It's not good for politics if things like this go on in real life, but it sure makes a great movie.
I:9518;374;With beautiful and picturesque San Francisco as a background, the movie focuses on the tracking of a psychopath, the Scorpio killer who has everyone in the city suspecting their grocer, the taxi driver, and the washing machine repair man.
I:9518;375;He's so god at portraying a character to whom the end justifies the means .
I:9518;376;If you've already seen it, see it again.
I:9518;377;It's just as good second .
I:9518;378;This is probably the best of the Dirty Harry films and Eastwood gives a memorable performance as Harry.
I:9518;379;The whole serie (5 movies including this one) is only showing an honest cop doing his best to do his job in the most efficient way, since he even rids community from the risk of recidivism.
I:9518;380;Dirty Harry is the film that introduced the titular character to the world.
I:9518;381;The film is not just a shoot 'em action movie, it is a tense thriller.
I:9518;382;One night scene in front of a large monument in which Harry thinks he has Scorpio cornered is extremely intense and thrilling and eerily shot.
I:9518;383;Mr. Eastwood is his stoic best as Calahan and he adds the right amount of sarcasm to the character.
I:9518;384;Dirty Harry broke massive box office records and it was well deserved in 1971.
I:9518;385;But for the make believe world of cinema Harry is the classic anti.
I:9518;386;Robinson is just great in this role and it is no doubt his most memorable performance.
I:9518;387;both great 70's character actors, and Reni Santoni as Harry's Mexican partner is the perfect match.
I:9518;388;Without a doubt Dirty Harry is the perfect baddass cop movie.
I:9518;389;The best of the Dirty Harry movies and the most realistic.
I:9518;390;The best and most realistic Calahan movie by far .
I:9518;391;Clint Eastwood has, over the years, quite cleverly hidden a speech impediment that hampered his early forays into acting.
I:9518;392;On any level, large or small, the desire to see justice done in universal.
I:9518;393;most memorable characters of his long and varied career, the iconoclastic veteran San Francisco detective, Harry Callahan.
I:9518;394;"in his many years on the job, Callahan has seen it all up close and suffered personal loss, as well
I:9518;395;and he is determined that the latter shall prevail at any cost.
I:9518;396;The attitude, the nuance and the eye for detail he brings to this role makes Callahan unique and memorable.
I:9518;397;And it's a satisfaction you will carry with you out of the theater, or beyond the confines of your own living room.
I:9518;398;There's a depth to Eastwood's portrayal that gives you some clues as to what it is that really makes Callahan tick, but at the same time he only lets you in so far, so that by the end there is still a bit of mystery behind the man.
I:9518;399;hero for our times, which serves as an indication of just how strong this performance by Eastwood is.
I:9518;400;It is, without question, one of his best.
I:9518;401;"Backed with a terrific score by Lalo Schifrin, ""Dirty Harry"" is a hard."
I:9518;402;It's escapist fare, to be sure, but it hits so close to home that it is both disconcerting and ultimately fulfilling.
I:9518;403;Definitely one you're going to remember.
I:9518;404;And that's the magic of the movies.
I:9518;405;I was a teenager when I first saw this film, and I think it's one of those Classics that just keeps getting better every time you see it!
I:9518;406;The supporting cast of Reni Santoni and Harry Guardino also give first class performances.
I:9518;407;Third straight Clint Eastwood / Don Siegelfilm and the best of the lot (though PlayMisty For Me (***) is fine as well).
I:9518;408;Very fine, make that great effortall the way around here.
I:9518;409;Sure, times have changed, and men don't wear patches on the elbows of their sports jackets as a fashion statement, but Dirty Harry is still a powerful and exciting picture, as relevant today as it was in the early 70's.
I:9518;410;tightly directed by Don Siegel, with the gritty side of San Francisco as its backdrop, Dirty Harry is the story of a cop who lives for the hunt, and captures the changes in the American criminal justice system well ahead of its time.
I:9518;411;Clint Eastwood gives one of his signature performances, and Andrew Robinson plays one of the all.
I:9518;412;There's a nice montage of the five Harry movies, with In.
I:9518;413;vida as the musical backdrop.
I:9518;414;Power to the People, Right On!
I:9518;415;accepted theory on crime, as well as one of the best.
I:9518;416;A whole new slant on how to deal with a potential suicide.
I:9518;417;No doubt Harry Callahan is a memorable landmark of a character in cinema.
I:9518;418;liners are some of the best.
I:9518;419;Sure, Dirty Harry acted with the best intentions and we know he was right.
I:9518;420;After seeing each of the two films for the first time, I vividly recall joining those around me in the theatre as they rose and cheered.
I:9518;421;In some situations, it may take his 44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world.
I:9518;422;it is important to remember when seeing this film again, as I did recently, that it portrays elements of an urban society few of us ever experience.
I:9518;423;Its primary purpose is to tell a story.
I:9518;424;Its influence proved to be substantial.
I:9518;425;He always seems fearless, which is another voyeristic thrill about Eastwood in these rolls.
I:9518;426;"boiled, politically incorrect San Francisco cop ""DIRTY HARRY"" should connect with a vast new audience eager to (.)"
I:9518;427;Brilliantly directed by Don Siegel, the intense action follows Harry's hunt for a psycho serial sniper holding the city by the bay hostage.
I:9518;428;This film secured Clint Eastwood's iconic status.
I:9518;429;"All five Dirty harry films are available as a set and there's also a great new full length documentary, ""Clint Eastwood: Out of the Shadows"" available seperately."
I:9518;430;Politically out of the acceptable zone and a truly terrific film of visceral impact.
I:9518;431;Eastwood was born to play this role.
I:9518;432;Will make you laugh the entire time!
I:9518;433;Famous quotes that will put you on the floor!
I:9518;434;When looking for a good bad guy looses movie Clint Eastwood made Inspector Callahan a winner!
I:9518;435;The Dirty Harry movies are good entertainment and Dirty Harry himself is a cultural icon, but this older set has been superseded.
I:9518;436;Warner Home Video has announced the details of new releases of all five Dirty Harry movies with new special features.
I:9518;437;"discUltimate Collector's Edition, or separately in Special or Deluxe editions (""special"" being superior to ""deluxe"" here."
I:9518;438;disc Special Edition, the others will all be on single discs, but all will have special features).
I:9518;439;The first Dirty Harry movie I ever saw, and I loved it.
I:9518;440;Clint Eastwood was exactly the right choice for this movie and the succeeding Harry movies.
I:9518;441;This is one of those films that preys on the fears and emotions of its viewers, but does it rather well.
I:9518;442;Makes for a nice story and usually achieves its goal, though it simultaneously insults us as viewers.
I:9518;443;Nonetheless, I have a weakness for serial killer movies, especially when written well.
I:9518;444;This one is particularly memorable because it features Clint Eastwood in the title role, though Andy Robinson is at least as remarkable as the Scorpio Killer.
I:9518;445;He represents the biggest challenge to the killer, so the cat and mouse game ensues.
I:9518;446;up citizens with firearms are exactly what America needs to be great once again.
I:9518;447;Taut, suspensful direction by Siegel, who thoroughly understands Eastwood's onscreen character.
I:9518;448;line, the precursor to Go ahead, make my day .
I:9518;449;This first installment is the best of the all for the following reasons:1.
I:9518;450;The soundtrack is the best of the series, with exception of the end credits which in my opinion the best is Magnum Force.2.
I:9518;451;the direction was top knotch, thanks to Don Siegel.5.
I:9518;452;It has the best final climactic ending sequence, starting when Harry leaps onto the bus.6.
I:9518;453;it makes the best use of script to heighten affect.
I:9518;454;and it has the fastest (good) pacing.8.
I:9518;455;Ah Inspector Callahan, is that a gun in your jacket, or are you just happy to read my review of your movie?
I:9518;456;Oh yeah, and we really don't seem to mind that he does.
I:9518;457;it is great film making when you root for the cop to break the law, so you can have them strike back at those that have wronged society.
I:9518;458;The screenplay gives Eastwood the chance to deliver some classic lines.3.
I:9518;459;The rest of the cast are excellent.
I:9518;460;Eastwood's huge screen presence, and caustic delivery of his lines is unmatched in cinema history.
I:9518;461;I like the movie fine and I think Mr. eastwood is one of the greatest actors of all times.
I:9518;462;This movie is one of the best.
I:9518;463;The music in this movie is very good as well.
I:9518;464;I also enjoy the bank robbery scene when Harry yells out halt!
I:9518;465;This movie made me a huge fan of Clint Eastwood.
I:9518;466;It's the original and undisputed king of action movies!
I:9518;467;Dirty Harry is, plain and simple, an outstanding film that is far deeper than its reputation.
I:9518;468;bureaucritization of law enforcement, of its growing concern with appearance over protecting the public.
I:9518;469;And, of course, a great flick.
I:9518;470;We learn from the beginning of the film that his doctor, who he chats up with more warmth than his white bosses, is black.
I:9518;471;it is cues like these that reveal the true heart of the picture.
I:9518;472;Dirty Harry is an outstanding combination of good acting, expert directing, action and suspense.
I:9518;473;"XXXXX""To the city of San Francisco: I will enjoy killing one person every day until you pay me 100,000 dollars."
I:9518;474;"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning in personal column, ""San Francisco Chronicle"" and I will set up meeting."
I:9518;475;If I do not hear from you, it will be my next pleasure to kill a Catholic priest or a [black person].
I:9518;476;"Scorpio""The above comes from this absorbing crime thriller This film, which introduced ""Dirty Harry"" to the world, was one of the major movies that shot Clint Eastwood into super."
I:9518;477;"the first scenes of this movie are especially good, what I call ""signature Eastwood."
I:9518;478;Andy Robinson gives a mesmerizing performance as serial killer, Scorpio.
I:9518;479;the finale of this movie is unforgettable.
I:9518;480;the background music adds to each scene.
I:9518;481;there was considerable controversy when this movie was first released.
I:9518;482;I found all of them interesting.
I:9518;483;in conclusion, in my opinion, this was one of the best of the five Dirty Harry movies that was made.
I:9518;484;John Milius is the greatest screenwriter you never heard of, not to mention a terrific director.
I:9518;485;He describes the Dirty Harry Callahan character as God's lonely man.
I:9518;486;Milius is that rarest of rarities, a Hollywood conservative.
I:9518;487;The scene is worth watching in light of Abu Ghraib and the concept of the ticking time bomb theory of interrogation that the terror era has brought upon us.
I:9518;488;The music is creepy and the villain is fantastic.
I:9518;489;director Don Siegel did an excellent job including many scenic locations and giving the film a realSan Francisco feel.
I:9518;490;it was a success and set the style for a genre of action films.
I:9518;491;they are all great but the original is a downright American classic.
I:9518;492;Although I really enjoy watching the second and third movies in the series, Dirty Harry is still a lot of fun to watch again after several months.
I:9518;493;And, San Francisco is so much fun to see, just like the movie Bullitt.
I:9518;494;I was pleased with the product and the seller.
I:9518;495;I think this movie is best seen once a year, at least for me.
I:9518;496;even though all that is true, I still would recommend everyone see this movie at least once in their life for that classic line: do you feel lucky?
I:9518;497;that's the reason I make an exception and watch it once a year myself.
I:9518;498;Clint Eastwood in one of his signature roles, a great 70s film raw and gritty the blu ray looks marvelous a must have for any film fan

I:9518;502;It's a clever touch by the writers and Director Don Siegel to show the obsessive drive of the character.

I:9518;504;"This will set the table for Eastwood to deliver his famous, ""Do you feel lucky punk"" offer to Scoprio at the film's climax."
I:9518;505;nearly 40 years later Dirty Harry still holds up well.
I:9518;506;Eastwood is the model of cool.
I:9518;507;You need only listen for a few moments to know you're watching one of those memorable cop films.
I:9518;508;This is one of the most important films of the 1970s.
I:9518;509;extrasClint Eastwood's biographer, Richard Schickel provides an all.
I:9518;510;new commentary on the film.
I:9518;511;While Schickel can be dry and goes several minutes without speaking, he offers some insightful views on the film.
I:9518;512;Modern filmmakers and actors share their thoughts on the landmark film and how it has influenced their own work.
I:9518;513;This is the first, and by far the best.
I:9518;514;Dirty Harry is a legendary action film and a classic Eastwood flick, definitely among his greatest.
I:9518;515;Eastwood is Dirty Harry Callahan, a cop who always gets the job done .
I:9518;516;"directed with a dynamite script and a funky score
I:9518;517;well in all this excitement i've gone and lost track myself but this being one of clint eastwoods greatest movies you have to ask yourself why wouldn't you own this movie?
I:9518;518;Frist R rated movie I went to .
I:9518;519;Part of what makes the film such an effective thriller, is an extremely tight screenplay that has barely a wasted scene.
I:9518;520;Siegel and Eastwood had developed a special relationship, having previously collaborated on several films, notablyCoogan's Bluff(1968), and Dirty Harry would arguably be the high point of their achievements together.
I:9518;521;The plot has a few sticking points, but overall events play so smoothly, that the film seems longer than its 102 minute running time.
I:9518;522;Dirty Harry immediately draws you in, and takes you on a dark and twisted journey.
I:9518;523;The Major wants to pay the ransom, but Callahan has had enough, and takes matters into his own hands.
I:9518;524;It was certainly a well focused effort, as almost everything that happens is relevant to the central story.
I:9518;525;even those that regard Dirty Harry as a terrific cop film, can probably concede that while often riveting, there are many times when reality doesn't get in the way of great drama.
I:9518;526;The foiled bank robbery, and Harry's classic repartee with robber Albert Popwell, is pure cinematic gold.
I:9518;527;Chico displays remarkable aim with an extremely powerful flashlight, as does Scorpio in shooting out a neon sign.
I:9518;528;The inspired and chilling performance of newcomer Andy Robinson, is one of the key elements to the film's success.
I:9518;529;Fortunately after Eastwood had completed his film, the role was still available.
I:9518;530;Composer Lalo Shifrin (Mission Impossible, Enter The Dragon), who also worked with Siegel and Eastwood on Coogan's Bluff, makes a tremendous contribution to the atmosphere of the film, with his haunting and at times driving soundtrack.
I:9518;531;Along with various interviews and testimonials, it's a pretty comprehensive package for a classic film, that has affected the course of action films in the 70's and well beyond, and spawned four Dirty Harry sequels so far.
I:9518;532;ray] is a particularly economical deal.
I:9518;533;, dialog and plot are excellent .
I:9518;534;"i particularly enjoyed the play onthe so called ""hippy"", ""pop."
I:9518;535;the scene in the stadium is amazing.
I:9518;536;i love those kind of details.
I:9518;537;probably the most memorable ofall guns in movie history.
I:9518;538;it was one of the stars of the movie.You can't help but smile when Harrytakes a bite out of his foot.
I:9518;539;it is so nearly perfect, that I feelsomewhat guilty rating it with threestars, but I must do.
I:9518;540;i felt embarassed for Lalo Schifrin,whose musical score is amazing,having to include ahere's.
I:9518;541;Dirty Harry came out way back in 1971, 40 years ago, but it is still a great entertaining movie.
I:9518;542;Dirty Harry is by far the best of the series and I would give most of the credit to the antagonist of the film, the Scorpio killer (played chillingly well by Andy Robinson).
I:9518;543;This is because of Robinson's great acting but also due to the writing.
I:9518;544;Scorpio accuses Harry of trying to kill him and demands a lawyer and medical attention.
I:9518;545;The rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between Harry and the repulsive killer.
I:9518;546;Therefore in my opinion Dirty Harry from 1971 stands above the entire franchise and it stands as one of the great entertaining cop thrillers of all time.
I:9518;547;Perfectly acted and written a 5 star classic!
I:9518;548;Eastwood plays Harry Callahan with the appropriate cynicism and, as a result, the character is both honest and hilarious.
I:9518;549;The sequence that involves Callahan's new partner asking why they call him Dirty Harry provides the most memorable dialogue in the movie.
I:9518;550;I'd always heard about the awesome 70's action and the epic one.
I:9518;551;liners, but finally seeing it for myself was an excellent experience.
I:9518;552;Released in 1971 to luke warm reviews, Dirty Harry is without question one of the best urban police action films ever made, and is a classic piece of American Cinema that's as relevant today as it was then.
I:9518;553;beautifully filmed on location in San Francisco by Bruce Surtees, director Don Siegel's film captures the pulse and fears of the American public in a time of great social upheaval.
I:9518;554;The movie addresses those fears in a law enforcement shackled by Miranda theme, and draws the main characters in broad uncompromising strokes.
I:9518;555;The movie is also aided by an excellent musical score by Lalo Schifrin.
I:9518;556;The soundtrack is at times slow and ethereal, then accelerates, beautifully accentuating action sequences.
I:9518;557;But the film succeeds on several levels built around Eastwood's great performance as a frustrated cop who wants to put a murderer away.
I:9518;558;had invited John Milius, Hollywood's best.
I:9518;559;He even pays a man to beat him up and then puts the blame on Harry.
I:9518;560;he's so impossibly evil that even the most fuzzy.
I:9518;561;The film's message is simple .
I:9518;562;is only briefly touched on.
I:9518;563;I believe the best interests of society are served by occasionally letting the guilty go free.
I:9518;564;"considered only as a movie, ""Dirty Harry"" is worth four stars."
I:9518;565;It was a great idea taking the soft deliberate speaking, Western King, Clint Eastwood and placing him in society as San Francisco police inspector Harry Callahan.
I:9518;566;In a sense this movie is timeless as hostage situations still affect our urban areas but with this cutting edge cinematic view we become somewhat disconcerted by our own laws and policies.
I:9518;567;Villan Andrew Robinson is still working today as he did a great job making us hate him in 1971.
I:9518;568;I saw this movie as a kid and was hooked the moment Lalo Schifrin's incredibly cool theme kicked in.
I:9518;569;"This movie is an institution, and when I'm showing sites to people, I always associate them with Dirty Harry and when you see the smile come over their face, well as they say in the VISA commercials
I:9518;570;issue is an improvement by leaps bounds!
I:9518;571;I'm willing to pay a few more cents for a more durable covering for my discs, and I'm sure many others are as well.
I:9518;572;There's the other doc, a seven.
I:9518;573;Dirty Harry is a great film that will have you rushing to the movie store to get part 2!
I:9518;574;This film is Clint Eastwood at his best!
I:9518;575;The acting by Eastwood is phenomenal.
I:9518;576;He is the kind of guy that likes to work alone and finish the job right.
I:9518;577;if you are a fan of action, suspense films, or of Eastwood, you will very much enjoy this film.
