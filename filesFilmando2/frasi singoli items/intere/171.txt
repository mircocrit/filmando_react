I:12166;1;One of my favorite Russell Crowe movies.
I:12166;2;Really great true story of a depression time hero.
I:12166;3;Also a good love story and rather emotional.
I:12166;4;i loved it the first time i watched it at a friends house and so i grabbed it off amazon for very cheap.
I:12166;5;James Braddock had two great opponents in his lifetime, Max Bauer and the Great Depression.
I:12166;6;We see with what finesse he is able to confront both in this stylish and lovable movie.
I:12166;7;Braddock is a fine boxer, able to support himself and his family well.
I:12166;8;After working on the shipyard and his hand recovers, he gets to go back in the ring.
I:12166;9;Cinderella Man is a super movie.
I:12166;10;"It has the struggle and heart of the best boxing movies (like ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"") especially with a good story to go behind the scenes."
I:12166;11;Russell Crowe is brimming with toughness and decency as Braddock, and Renee Zellweger is nuanced as his nervous, but caring wife.
I:12166;12;Paul Giamatti is also in fine form as his manager.
I:12166;13;"Director Ron Howard has accomplished much by zeroing in on every detail
I:12166;14;deserved honor to Jim Braddock, a decent man who achieved so much after losing basically everything during the Great Depression.
I:12166;15;Awesome boxing sequences, and Oscar.
I:12166;16;worthy performances by Paul Giamatti and Russell Crowe, make this film a classic, one that is definitely worth seeing over and over again.
I:12166;17;, you will be inspired yet again by another great sports legend!
I:12166;18;I love this movie, has an amazing story.
I:12166;19;Keeps your attention and shows you what he went through to make sure his family can stay together and make it through the Great depression
I:12166;20;This movie brings me back to my childhood and watching it with my dad.
I:12166;21;One of the best films to watch with dad.
I:12166;22;Cinderella Man is an excellent piece of movie entertainment.
I:12166;23;It is a great story, made better by fact that it is almost true.
I:12166;24;It looks great, the music hits just the right mood and the performances are excellent.
I:12166;25;Craig Bierko does a good job of doing what he is asked to do, i. e. make Baer a boo hiss baddy.
I:12166;26;Baer still has living relatives who are having to watch a man they knew and loved and who died of a heartattack at a relatively young age, turned into a pantomime villian to suit the scriptwriters.
I:12166;27;It is far more interesting to watch a movie that gives you a clear and accurate description of real people and real events rather than a piece of hokum.
I:12166;28;Based on the true life story of Depression Era boxer, James Braddock, Cinderella starring Russell Crowe as Braddock is a heartfelt and stunning achievment in cinematic history.
I:12166;29;In the beginning, the couple and their three small children are happy, healthy, and rich but then the Great Depression strikes, their world is turned upside down.
I:12166;30;The only reason I can't give this film 5 stars is that Cinderella Man can be slow at times, some of the boxing scenes are kind of boring but if you are a guy, of course you'll love those scenes, but overall, the film is classy, enchanting, and inspiring.
I:12166;31;Crowe and Zellweger are perfection together.
I:12166;32;This is what good, solid filmmaking is all about.
I:12166;33;If you love boxing films you will flip over this picture.
I:12166;34;Heart and depth are perfect adjectives to describe what unfolds before you.
I:12166;35;Russell Crow should easily have won an acadamy award for his portrayal as Braddock.
I:12166;36;paul Giamitti is spot on as Braddocks trainer, showing us all what it takes to throw oneself into a role.
I:12166;37;The highs and lows of life, the force of passion, true love and brutal honesty make it work on all levels.
I:12166;38;And, of course being a boxing film it has action aplenty in the ring.
I:12166;39;"The ""chic flick"" elements give the movie an ability to be soft and tender, but the harsh blows of action will hold the male audiences eyes."
I:12166;40;Both sexes can appreciate this well done made in America story.
I:12166;41;Destined to be a true classic.
I:12166;42;Russell Crowe is magnificent as boxer Jim Braddock, in a multi.
I:12166;43;layered performance that shows he is perhaps the most versatile and brilliant actor alive.
I:12166;44;"life story is one of a comeback in 1934, from the pit of destitution during the great depression, and much more
I:12166;45;The supporting cast is also terrific, with Ren e Zellwegger wonderful as Mae Braddock, and Paul Giamatti outstanding as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould.
I:12166;46;masterfully directed by Ron Howard, this is a film with substance, a rarity considering Hollywood's recent output, and a joy to view repeatedly.
I:12166;47;The cinematography by Salvatore Totino is remarkable, capturing the look of the era with what looks like natural lighting, and the fight scenes are astounding.
I:12166;48;Adding to the beauty of this film is the score by Thomas Newman, and I especially like the music during the 15th round of the Braddock/Baer fight.
I:12166;49;"Of special interest are the ""Deleted Scenes,"" with the extraordinary ""splint scene,"" as well as archival footage of the Braddock/Baer fight, and other interviews, film clips and stills of the Braddock family and those relevant to the story."
I:12166;50;Cinderella Man is 144 minutes of superb filmmaking, with a performance by Crowe that is unforgettable, and a fabulous 2.
I:12166;51;Fantastic movie, one of Russell Crowe's absolute best performances.
I:12166;52;I can watch this movie over and over again.
I:12166;53;It's a human story more than a boxing story and my wife loves it as well.
I:12166;54;No.Yes its true the movie does use plenty of cliches, we get the swelling music at the movie's more sentimental moments, and the sometimes cheesy dialogue, but I went along with the movie and got choked up at all the right moments.
I:12166;55;"In this sense ""Cinderella Man"" belongs in the same class as Howard's other films such as ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" which reteams many of the same people besides Russell Crowe and Howard."
I:12166;56;But Braddock has to keep on going, despite what people may think of him because of his family.
I:12166;57;She says each time Jim takes a hit, it's like she's taken one too.
I:12166;58;Now how original is that line, I ask you?
I:12166;59;One of the boys actually steals some food for them.
I:12166;60;He goes up against the number two contender for the heavyweight title.
I:12166;61;Both movies tells us the story of the underdog.
I:12166;62;He bacame a symbol of the times.
I:12166;63;You probably want something more objective.
I:12166;64;Crowe is quite good in the movie.
I:12166;65;"He has played heroes before, people who have fought the odds against them in movies such as ""Gladiator"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Insider""."
I:12166;66;I also liked Howard's directing.
I:12166;67;"At its heart ""Cinderella Man"" is really just an old."
I:12166;68;fashion story about finding the American dream.
I:12166;69;This proves they try once in a while.
I:12166;70;line: Possibly one of the year's best film.
I:12166;71;Effective performance by Crowe and Zellweger, who pull on our heartstring for all they are worth.
I:12166;72;"The movie ranks up with Howard's best films including ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind""."
I:12166;73;I don't make a habit of posting reviews, but this movie is one of the best portrayals of the true American Spirit!
I:12166;74;Hard work, family, faith, honor.
I:12166;75;If you haven't seen it, please do.
I:12166;76;Frankly, the fight scenes in Cinderella Man are pretty darn good.
I:12166;77;viewers able to forgive this will find much to like.
I:12166;78;Braddock is a wonderfully decent man, his morality is inspiring.
I:12166;79;Ron Howard knows his onions and did a lovely job with sets, costumes, interiors, (and cars!)
I:12166;80;, the sense of history is exceptionally good.
I:12166;81;Paul Giamatti is outstanding, (forget Sideways but don't miss him in American Splendor).
I:12166;82;Most of all, instead of seeing it as a boxing movie think of it as a morality tale of surviving the Great Depression.
I:12166;83;It works far better on that level, and Braddock becomes a far more interesting, and credible protagonist.
I:12166;84;well acted but not one of howard's best though.
I:12166;85;If you liked rocky, this will make you cheer.
I:12166;86;I thought this was one of the best movies I have seen.
I:12166;87;Movies based on facts seem to hit my heart more.
I:12166;88;we should all have his courage and strength to make our lives wonderful!
I:12166;89;Just when I've lost all hope that American film makers have lost their touch a really good film comes along.
I:12166;90;more people cheered at this film showing than at the showing of the new Star Wars movie, and that says a lot in my book.
I:12166;91;everyone was in top form.
I:12166;92;Crowe will steal your heart as the down and out boxer on a comeback just to feed his family.
I:12166;93;Zellweger's great as the depression era wife trying to keep her family together.
I:12166;94;You can easily cry throughout this film, both sad and happy tears.
I:12166;95;all in all it was a great reality based movie full of American spirit and pride.
I:12166;96;I think this is definitely the best movie of 2005.
I:12166;97;The cast is amazing and the story was so moving.
I:12166;98;I love the era it takes place in too.
I:12166;99;Its a good story about good family values and morals and I guess that is what turns off Hollywood.
I:12166;100;Is really a 4.5 Very nice to see a movie about a real personthat was a hero to so many in New Jersey.
I:12166;101;Kudo to russellCrow for a good believable performance.
I:12166;102;anyway good movie for the holidays.
I:12166;103;Cinderella Man is, simply, a wonderful film.
I:12166;104;It is a tale of heroism in the face of adversity, a victory of stoicism and a truly heart warming story.
I:12166;105;It is far better than I expected and a credit to the direction of Ron Howard and the superb acting skills of Russell Crowe.
I:12166;106;the plot is based, as is said in Hollywood, on a true story.
I:12166;107;To everyone's surprise, including his, Braddock wins the fight.
I:12166;108;The rest, as is said, is history.
I:12166;109;i strongly recommend this film to all.
I:12166;110;It has real cred while, at the same time, it tugs at the heart strings.
I:12166;111;Russell Crowe is absolutely magnificent.
I:12166;112;Have no doubts, this is a great film!
I:12166;113;Russell Crowe completely devours his role in this impressive depression era biopic about boxer James Braddock.
I:12166;114;His steely dedication to his character comes across with every minor shift of his facial expressions and impresses upon the audience a sense of pain and oppression wrapped in the warmth and appreciation that only a true master of his craft would be able to deliver.
I:12166;115;Crowe has truly honed his craft over the past few years and has developed into arguably our finest working actor, and that's a fact I'm more than willing to argue!
I:12166;116;Here, in one of his finest performances since his work in `The Insider' Crowe is able to transcend the screen and create a character that the audience can feel for, embrace and comfort and most importantly a character that the audience wants to embrace and comfort.
I:12166;117;James Braddock is one of the most likable screen heroes in recent years.
I:12166;118;the film follows Braddock's fall from the top, a big home and a successful career till he finds himself living in destitution, relying on a prayer to get enough work throughout the week to feed his three children and keep his family warm.
I:12166;119;Standing by his side through it all is his loving and supporting wife Mae, played by Renee Zellweger with the same effortless dedication found in Crowe.
I:12166;120;Braddock struggles along trying to instill morals and faith in his children despite their horrible circumstances, and that's what makes this man so appealing.
I:12166;121;They would survive, and they would do that with their morality in tact.
I:12166;122;braddock finally gets his chance at redemption when he reteams with his former manager Joe Gould, played with fire and fervor by Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti who is just having a great breakthrough with his career lately.
I:12166;123;Although times are hard and Braddock is far from the shape he was in while in his prime he still manages to capture the hearts of those in the community and eventual scores a fight against Max Baer, a ruthless fighter known for killing in the ring.
I:12166;124;The final fight is so brilliantly directed and choreographed that I'm still baffled at Howard's exclusion from the official Oscar race.
I:12166;125;This is truly his finest film and his most effective performance behind the camera.
I:12166;126;the supporting cast is top notch as well.
I:12166;127;important Baer to Paddy Considine's troubled neighbor, all involved put in a good effort and elevate this film beyond the competition.
I:12166;128;One of my favorite supporting performances of the bunch must go to Bruce McGill who just stole his scenes with his infectious anger and selfishness.
I:12166;129;Paul Giamatti attacked his role with equal parts passion and integrity and comes off memorable and important, and Zellweger masters the entire look, feel and temperance of the era beautifully, but it's Crowe above all else who deserves the praise and recognition for his powerhouse performance.
I:12166;130;the uplifting and inspirational story of James Braddock will bring tears to your eyes and warm your heart as you watch this man put his family and his community before self.
I:12166;131;Scenes where he offers his daughter his breakfast will leave you choked up and scenes where he pleads for a helping hand with his hat in his hand are especially effective and will have you balling like a baby, at least I was.
I:12166;132;Howard and company beautifully capture the time, the place and the heart of this story and deliver one of the finest sports dramas in recent years.
I:12166;133;`Cinderella Man' proves to be a complete and utter joy from beginning to end and a most memorable movie watching experience.
I:12166;134;action is the true nature of the temple's soul, and the only motivation behind that action is pure love.
I:12166;135;this is true family values.
I:12166;136;i ordered it for him as a surprise.
I:12166;137;CINDERELLA MAN is pure fiction but as boxing films go, decent entertainment.
I:12166;138;Casting was perfect for this movie.
I:12166;139;I think this would actually be a great date night movie, because there is something in it for everybody!
I:12166;140;In my 34 years of existance, it was the first time I was proud to be from New Jersey.
I:12166;141;Thanks Mr. Howard and Mr. Crowe for bringing this hero to our attention!!!
I:12166;142;I do recommend this movie, especially for boxing fans.
I:12166;143;By chance and hard work from his similarly down and out manager, he was able to rise to the very height of his profession.
I:12166;144;The complete story is well told by Jeremy Schaap in his recently released book of the same name (the book and the movie were independently done).
I:12166;145;The two lead characters, Russell Crowe, and Paul Giamatti, were very believable in their roles.
I:12166;146;Ren e Zellweger played Braddock's wife.
I:12166;147;In sum, this is a good movie.
I:12166;148;Boxing is a perfect metaphor for life.
I:12166;149;It tells the real life story of James Braddock, a man of boundless bravery and big heart, who once rose from ashes like phoenix and proved to everyone and what's more importand .
I:12166;150;to himself, that everything's possible if you really want it.
I:12166;151;russel Crowe did an amazing job here, to my opinion this is his best part to date.
I:12166;152;A really wonderful movie for everybody, even for women who don't like boxing flicks mostly.
I:12166;153;What excellent words I read by other reviewers here!
I:12166;154;the cast is excellent and on.
I:12166;155;"This is one of my favorite Russell Crowe performances, matching his previous movie with director Ron Howard, ""A Beautiful Mind"", matching ""L. a. Confidential"", and matching ""The Insider""."
I:12166;156;Everything about this movie is beautiful and top.
I:12166;157;"This is Ron Howard's best movie yet, including regards to ""A Beautiful Mind"" which received the Best Picture Academy Award only a few years ago."
I:12166;158;"even if viewers in their natural variety of tastes do not consider ""Cinderella Man"" as the best picture of the year, it is certainly still among the top few."
I:12166;159;It is a complete boxing picture and much better than its previous year's Oscar winner.
I:12166;160;This film is so beautifully directed, so perfectly edited, and so well acted, it borders on majestic.
I:12166;161;Crowe's performance is stellar .
I:12166;162;the best I've seen yet.
I:12166;163;avowed pugilphobe, cheering and yelling with every scene), Crowe and the supporting cast's perfect performances, the excellent depiction of the Great Depression and Northern New Jersey (I spent a large portion of my childhood in Bergen County) and most of all, the amazing story of an everyman named Jim Braddock, who deserves to be remembered as an American legend.
I:12166;164;Everyone should see this movie!
I:12166;165;I love stories of victorious underdogs.
I:12166;166;Lots of history with the Great Depresssion.
I:12166;167;plus I love to share true stories with my boys.
I:12166;168;Our whole family loved this movie!
I:12166;169;Great gift for my boyfriend.
I:12166;170;Beyond Russell Crowe being one of the best actors in Hollywood, Cinderella Man speaks to the heart of everyone.
I:12166;171;Cinderella Man really shows what true grit and determination, as well as a faith in something much bigger than ourselves, can get us through the hardest of times.
I:12166;172;becoming a hero and inspiration to many who experienced the same trials and tribulations as himself.
I:12166;173;the performances of Russell and Renee are wonderful.
I:12166;174;It's a feel good experience families can watch together.
I:12166;175;Still the premise of the story is what makes it worthwhile.
I:12166;176;russell is transformed into Jim Braddock so well I didn't recognize him at first.
I:12166;177;it's now one of my favorite movies.
I:12166;178;The story is great, the acting is excellent and I highly recommend it.
I:12166;179;advised matches had cost him a championship shot.
I:12166;180;His vision of the Depression is the most accurate and heartbreaking since the documentaries of the '30s, and will come as a revelation to those whose only knowledge of the period is a paragraph in a history book.
I:12166;181;working, decent man with no higher vision than to provide his family a better life, and as magnificently portrayed by Crowe, he embodies qualities of honesty and dignity that many of us dream of, but seldom achieve.
I:12166;182;in for an Oscar for his performance, it's that good!Matching Crowe's portrayal are Ren e Zellweger, as his loyal wife, Mae, who perfectly channels a '30s 'style', as well as a gutsiness that is timeless, and the wonderful Paul Giamatti, as manager Joe Gould, who would sell everything he owned, rather than see Braddock give up.
I:12166;183;deserved Oscar, for this role.
I:12166;184;Cinderella Man is a film that will continue to be cherished long after the filmmakers are gone, a tale rooted in an earlier era, but still timeless.
I:12166;185;One of the best movies I have ever seen!
I:12166;186;CM will go down as one of those perfect films in movie history.
I:12166;187;Gives the viewer an idea of what it was really like during the great depression.
I:12166;188;I was especially moved by the Braddock family's devotion to each other.
I:12166;189;Cinderella Man is the Ron Howard directed movie about Jim Braddock, a depression era boxer who beat the odds to become the heavyweight champion of the world.
I:12166;190;the movie is its most powerful when portraying the hardships that Braddock must face looking for work.
I:12166;191;Braddock's manager, played by Paul Giammatti, gets Braddock another fight against a contender, so Braddock reenters the ring one last time on a days notice.
I:12166;192;The boxing is realistic and violent and one of the best scenes is after Braddock wins his comeback bout, he stands in the audience, watching Max Baer brutally pummel and taunt an opponent.
I:12166;193;This was a good movie, and emotionally uplifting.
I:12166;194;cinderella Man is a good movie that men and women will both enjoy.
I:12166;195;Being a true story, you won't see the expected twists and turns, but you'll definitely enjoy the film.
I:12166;196;This is one of the best movies of the year, no doubt about it.
I:12166;197;For this price I want Russell Crowe to autograph it and personally deliver it to my door.
I:12166;198;person loves this movie and this was a good price.
I:12166;199;And that makes all the difference.
I:12166;200;ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression.
I:12166;201;The camera work is phenomenal.
I:12166;202;"But when Braddock is later asked at a press conference why he is fighting at his age and after so many poor showings, all he has to say is ""milk"" to be supremely eloquent."
I:12166;203;"Analogous to Howard's film ""Apollo 13"", you may know the outcome, but there's wonderful suspense in the details."
I:12166;204;These were among the most exciting last twenty minutes I've seen on film.
I:12166;205;our audience was like a prize fight audience rather than a movie audience, cheering, booing, gasping, groaning during the fights.
I:12166;206;It is a great movie, an inspirational story, and its strength.
I:12166;207;My husband saw this a few years ago and I have to say we enjoyed it just as much the second time around.
I:12166;208;It's a really great movie .
I:12166;209;Beautifully directed by Opie Taylor himself, wonderfully acted(Paul Giamatti does amazing acting in this), and masterfully written, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen!
I:12166;210;Russell Crowe plays legendary boxer James J. Braddock in Ron Howard's well directed film based on the life of this astounding man.
I:12166;211;But Braddock and his wife Mae (played by Renee Zellweger) will do anything to keep their heads above water while remaining morally upstanding citizens.
I:12166;212;then a glimmer of hope arrives.
I:12166;213;His old manager Joe Gould (the awesomely intense Paul Giamoti) offers him one last fight with a heavyweight title contender.
I:12166;214;But Braddock wins, relaunching his career and eventually getting a shot at Max Baer, the champ who's blows have killed two men already.
I:12166;215;history tells us that Braddock wins this fight, to the surprise of the then boxing commission and to the joy of millions of downtrodden Americans.
I:12166;216;getting a myopic view of family life during this time was a powerful way to present such a rags to riches story.
I:12166;217;The costumes and sets were spot.
I:12166;218;on period perfect and completely immersed the viewer in the times.
I:12166;219;cutout cinema Mr. Howard chooses to shoot (you remember Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind, right?)
I:12166;220;Although I enjoy these heart.
I:12166;221;wrenching and uplifting movies, I do wish that Mr. Howard could break out of that mold and produce something beyond the mainstream.
I:12166;222;True stories of people overcoming the odds is a better story, since it shows that it can be done.
I:12166;223;Personally I thought this was a great film for both women and men.
I:12166;224;Russell Crowe is outstanding as Jim Braddock and Rene Zellwiger is at her best as his supporting wife.
I:12166;225;The film has a great mix of action and romance with some great cinema photography, making it easy to believe your looking back to that era.
I:12166;226;over all, the film has a great pace with very little if any in the way of lag time and I was brought into the career of this Sports Icon even though I knew or basically knew the ending.
I:12166;227;The acting across the board is outstanding and for me it is one of those films I can watch maybe once a year and am glad to have it in my library.
I:12166;228;Excellent movie for the family.
I:12166;229;I love the ease of ordering from Amazon.
I:12166;230;The service and price is the best.
I:12166;231;This true american story during a very tough time in our nation was truly inspiring.
I:12166;232;Well worth watching again every few years.
I:12166;233;As fairy tales tend to confirm the specialness of their underdog heroes, they are particularly popular among U. s. consumers, who believe in their own specialness.
I:12166;234;ron Howard's new movie fits all these bills.
I:12166;235;Mae goes to church to pray for her man, where she discovers the whole neighborhood turned out to share in her efforts.
I:12166;236;to its credit, the movie does manage some striking boxing scenes .
I:12166;237;deftly choreographed, smartly shot, eerily subjective.
I:12166;238;Surprisingly inventive, these images can be jarring enough to alleviate some of the sappy factor.
I:12166;239;Loved Cinderella man and I don 't even like Russell Crowe!
I:12166;240;up heavyweight boxer who returns to the ring against all the odds and wins the Heavyweight Boxing Title!This is a heart wrenching tale of personal integrity and unflinching determination during a time of hopelessness.
I:12166;241;Russell Crowe fully embodies the soul of the legendary fighter James Braddock, while director Ron Howard expertly captures the patheos and collective loss of a generation in search of one single ray of hope.
I:12166;242;"great performances abound
I:12166;243;Truly the perfect foil for Crowe.
I:12166;244;I have also changed careers and study everyday for an upcoming test.
I:12166;245;Down and out boxer beats the reigning champ in a surprising upset.
I:12166;246;Out of a boxing job, Braddock managed to get work on a loading dock.
I:12166;247;braddock is portrayed as sensitive and compassionate.
I:12166;248;In many ways he is the ideal family man .
I:12166;249;he knows and practices all the right values, a proto.
I:12166;250;He and his family's tribulations are portrayed realistically .
I:12166;251;At the same time, the family manages to stay connected and the kids seem to enjoy themselves playing with the other poor kids in their New Jersey tenement (There was one New Jersey smells line thrown in.
I:12166;252;Paul Giamatti: In my opinion, he's one of the best actors out there.
I:12166;253;poster boy of Best Actor.
I:12166;254;on the up side, this is a rare contemporary movie that portrays Catholic piety in a positive light: Braddock's supporters include a large contingent of Irish Catholics, who see in him a symbol of hope amidst the despair of the Depression.
I:12166;255;Russell Crow and Ron Howard caught more than the boxer, but the plight of the Great Depression and the need for hope and character.
I:12166;256;I must admit that I viewed this film with some trepidation.
I:12166;257;The film is watchable and has some great performances even though it is not anything special.
I:12166;258;Kudos do need to be given to Paul Giamatti in one of the best roles of his career.
I:12166;259;The screenplay by Akiva Goldsman is well written but also nothing fantastic (even though more deserving of praise than A Beautiful Mind).
I:12166;260;on the whole this is a good film well worth a watch, it just didn't strike me as wonderful.
I:12166;261;worth a look but you may have a slight feeling of deja vu.
I:12166;262;Cinderella Man is a very good movie about the true.
I:12166;263;But Braddock proved them wrong, winning fight after fight against men who were younger and winning the opportunity to fight Max Baer in Madison Square Garden in front of a huge crowd.
I:12166;264;In many parts of the film, Giamatti's emotion exceeds that of Crowe's and he keeps the movie interesting with his volatile nature.
I:12166;265;Renee Zellweger plays the role of Mae and she is quite good.
I:12166;266;She shows her support for husband Jim but she privately hopes that he will retire from this sport for good.
I:12166;267;She knows the reputation of Max Baer and she doesn't want to become a widow like the two other wives whose husbands died following a bout with the champ.
I:12166;268;She is concerned for Jim, for herself, and for the family.
I:12166;269;But like a good, supportive spouse, she comes through in the end and backs her husband on his big day.
I:12166;270;russell Crowe's Braddock character is very cool and collected considering what is taking place around him.
I:12166;271;He knows his wife wants him to quit and he knows she is right, to an extent.
I:12166;272;talking, he still remains cool, keeping his level of concentration on the upcoming fight.
I:12166;273;i liked all of the performers in this movie.
I:12166;274;Crowe is excellent in his role as Braddock who, according to things I have read about him, was very much like the man portrayed in the movie.
I:12166;275;Zellweger is great too, as always.
I:12166;276;Probably the greatest surprise is the excellent performance turned in by Paul Giamatti as Braddock's trainer.
I:12166;277;Giamatti is a veteran of the big screen and he has been in many memorable roles.
I:12166;278;But there is something unique about this one and his moving performance almost netted him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
I:12166;279;besides the performances, Cinderella Man has many other positive points and chief among these is the message to continue to pursue one's dreams in spite of the odds.
I:12166;280;But instead of taking what life had handed him, he got up, brushed himself off, and moved forward in pursuit of his goals.
I:12166;281;He also showed incredible courage.
I:12166;282;But Braddock goes ahead and agrees to the challenge.
I:12166;283;another great part of this movie is the directing, especially during the boxing match at the end of the movie.
I:12166;284;He also shows what the other guy must look like to a man who has just been bashed in the head dozens of times through the use of blurred vision and unclear images.
I:12166;285;You can just feel the tremendous forces of those fists as they bash against the opponent's faces and bodies.
I:12166;286;perfect during this and other parts of the film and it leaves a lasting impression in your mind.
I:12166;287;ron Howard keeps things all in the family in this movie.
I:12166;288;overall, this is a very good movie that is inspirational as well as entertaining.
I:12166;289;Crowe, Giamatti, Zellweger, and the others all come through under the guiding hand of Ron Howard to create a memorable movie about the sport of boxing and the challenges that come with it.
I:12166;290;"I don't rank it as my favorite boxing movie (that honor still belongs to ""Raging Bull""), but it still has enough positive qualities to earn it an easy recommendation."
I:12166;291;But I loved this movie.
I:12166;292;What made Rocky great was Stallone had a shoestring budget that required the best for the least and a knack for making a great story breath life.
I:12166;293;The superb acting, story, music, and sets make Cinderella Man come to life.
I:12166;294;If you liked Rocky or any other movies that have realistic people you should enjoy this one.
I:12166;295;Once again Crowe comes through with a splendid job of acting.
I:12166;296;The support cast has some notables that give the feeling of real people that lived through the depression.
I:12166;297;This movie is a well written love story.
I:12166;298;about the lovebetween a man and his family.
I:12166;299;It is a true story that shouldbring tears to your eyes.
I:12166;300;I recomend it highly to anyone.
I:12166;301;This would be a great gift for any boxing fan.
I:12166;302;This was a very classy movie.
I:12166;303;It was delightful to view it from beginning to end.
I:12166;304;Cinderella Man is the real life story of Jim Braddock, a depression era boxer who went from a washed up has been to the ultimate glory of becoming the heavyweight champion of the world.
I:12166;305;While the movie is a bit over dramatized leading up to the championship match, it's a superb and moving story.
I:12166;306;It is refreshing to see a movie with no villains, and representing a true success story.
I:12166;307;I hope that no one comes along with something disparaging about Braddock, who is portrayed as honest, steady, competent, and personable.
I:12166;308;The three main actors were excellent and gave credibility to the story.
I:12166;309;This movie isn't for an action movies fans, the history in this movie is one that all of us have to help us value what we are and have, no matter what problems we have, always we have to make an effort to be honest with ourselves and to carry on with our life, looking for the opportunities where they are, not waiting for them.
I:12166;310;The performance of Russell Crowe is one of the best in his career.
I:12166;311;All people will always have a second chance, take big breathe and enjoy this film.
I:12166;312;written, acted and directed, it will deserve any laurels it takes this coming award season.
I:12166;313;The movie is based on a real life.
I:12166;314;It is a mesmerizing story with indelible imagery of The Great Depression.
I:12166;315;ron Howard makes movies about real people and real events.
I:12166;316;apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind, for instance.
I:12166;317;the movie begins with the young Braddock, winning every fight, never being knocked out, providing a comfortable life for his wife and children.
I:12166;318;He was a family man, a virtuous man who loved and took care of his family.
I:12166;319;a chance to earn a few dollars he so sorely needed.
I:12166;320;He was tall and his longer reach and powerful right mercilessly took out his opponents.
I:12166;321;Braddock and his manager studied films of Baer's fights.
I:12166;322;Just a fantastic family movie!
I:12166;323;During the great depression, a washed.
I:12166;324;A real inspiration, based on a true story!
I:12166;325;The acting is great, making this not only the best boxing movie I've ever seen, but one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:12166;326;I highly recommend this movie!
I:12166;327;Incredible story and wonderful performances by Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti!
I:12166;328;I wept and cheered as this story unfolded.
I:12166;329;It was inspirational and a testament to what can be achieved in life!
I:12166;330;I give this 4 stars,simply because of originality.
I:12166;331;It is an 'underdog' movie.
I:12166;332;Very moving, very real, and a little emotional.
I:12166;333;They will see a very well done human interest story about the depression and what it did to so many Americans, and how , we as a nation overcame that to become even stronger.
I:12166;334;Ron Howard does an excellent job as usual.
I:12166;335;It's hard to believe that 'little Opie' has developed into such a fine director.
I:12166;336;What he has done is created the best film of the year, so far.
I:12166;337;This story takes place in 1930, and for all you history majors, thats during the great depression.
I:12166;338;He gets a chance at another fight because someone dropped out.
I:12166;339;He whoops up on his opponent and gets back into the boxing circle.
I:12166;340;He actually killed two men in the ring.
I:12166;341;We all know what he is capable of doing and man, does he do it good here.
I:12166;342;He creates a great image a depression era.
I:12166;343;I'm pretty sure that both will recieve Oscar nominations for their roles in this flick.
I:12166;344;He provides the comic relief in a film that definitely needs a little.
I:12166;345;Theres a really good storyline of survival during the depression and its one of those feel good movies that makes you proud to be an American.
I:12166;346;A biography about a boxer that takes place during the great depression.
I:12166;347;The boxing, thanks to the tutelage of Muhammad Ali's legendary trainer Angelo Dundee, comes across as both realistic and compelling.
I:12166;348;especially from Paul Giamatti as Braddock's fiery and passionate trainer, Joe Gould.
I:12166;349;FYI: Few people know that Baer, although he did clown around and take Braddock entirely too lightly, actually fought this fight with a bum right hand.
I:12166;350;"Nonetheless, Braddock earned the Heavyweight title fair and square
I:12166;351;This is the story of James J. Braddock, directed by Ron Howard, who in my opinion is one of the better directors out there, that can take a story like the Braddock story and make it shine for the big screen!!
I:12166;352;This is a story of perserverance, strength, and family.
I:12166;353;He used this love to make ends meet and put food on the table for his family.
I:12166;354;In the end, he became one of the best boxers of all time, defeating the likes of Joe Lewis, and the dreaded, and dangerous Max Baer (who himself has the title of killing two men in the ring).
I:12166;355;a great story about love, strength, and the will to succeed!!
I:12166;356;Watch this movie.you will love it!!
I:12166;357;And Boxing was one of the sports my dad would watch while I was growing up, and I could never figure out why he enjoyed it so much.
I:12166;358;But there is something about movies about boxing that makes them magic.
I:12166;359;And Cinderella Man, based on a true story, is a fine example.
I:12166;360;It grabs your heart and never lets go.
I:12166;361;They are among the other great boxing movies.
I:12166;362;This is one of those movies I stick in sometimes when life gets really hard and you need something inspirational to lift you up out of the muck and mire.
I:12166;363;"I love the classic lines in this movie and how they are perfect metaphors for the struggles we all are engaged in:""This time I know what I'm fighting for."
I:12166;364;As fathers and husbands we struggle in this life to provide for our families and see to it that they prosper and flourish despite the hard knocks this life sometimes brings.
I:12166;365;and you are the Champion of my heart James J. Braddock.
I:12166;366;Now you go out there and win.
I:12166;367;That'll keep you in the battle, running your race with perseverance.
I:12166;368;the movie has a lot of colorful language, a lot, but that's boxing.
I:12166;369;"But for those who are comfortable with a more ""rough around the edges"" kind of movie, this film is a true to life allegory for deliverance when you ""Never give in."
I:12166;370;This movie has it all!
I:12166;371;And it's a true story.
I:12166;372;I could go into detail but I don't want to give any of it away, it's that good!
I:12166;373;Well written, well executed by a stellar, perfectly chosen cast.
I:12166;374;A heart wrenching story with a triumphant ending!
I:12166;375;One of the best movies I saw so far.
I:12166;376;The producers did a very good job.
I:12166;377;But it did very well depict the famalies life during the Great Depression, so that spread the word that it was a very hard 10+years.
I:12166;378;Truly a wonderful story, Cinderella Man has something for everyone.
I:12166;379;When offered one last fight, he begins a personal journey to save his family.
I:12166;380;Russel Crowe does a magnificent job portraying Braddock.
I:12166;381;With brutal fight scenes and emotional tensions, Cinderella Man is a film masterpiece.
I:12166;382;An excellent film, it is well deserving of your money.
I:12166;383;I agree with most reviewers that this was a great movie.
I:12166;384;What makes it all the more incredible is that it is based on a true story, one that will remain inspirational for years to come.
I:12166;385;life account of a movie storyline that has been played, replayed, and over.
I:12166;386;Many of the intimate moments are touching, yet the pacing is not quite right and sometimes you look for longer explorations concerning Braddock's character outside of the boxing ring.
I:12166;387;The last fight, though it brought chills and made me cheer, was like watching any other boxing movie.
I:12166;388;will you enjoy this movie?
I:12166;389;This is one of the best movies out there, sports or not.
I:12166;390;there is a lot of language in the movie, especially during the boxing scenes.
I:12166;391;Russell Crowe is good, but Paul Giamatti is outstanding.
I:12166;392;One of those movies that make you more curious about the true story behind it.
I:12166;393;The whole family can enjoy this one.
I:12166;394;Was told by family members that it was a good movie.
I:12166;395;With our economy the way it is made me real blessed and thankful to appreciate what we DO have.
I:12166;396;Wonderful determination and love story.
I:12166;397;russell Crowe does an excellent job in this role and it is inspirng to see the devotion to his family and the dignified way he tries to provide for them.
I:12166;398;plus this movie is based on a true story which add to its beauty and value.

I:12166;400;It is perfect in so many ways .
I:12166;401;story, sets, costumes, directing, acting.
I:12166;402;It is definitely one of Russell Crowe's finest performances, and that's saying a lot considering his body of work.
I:12166;403;anyway, this may be the best boxing movie I've ever seen, and I've seen most of them.
I:12166;404;riches sports story about a very likable hero, heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock, played fantastically by Russell Crowe.
I:12166;405;"This is another ""Seabiscuit,"" meaning a true."
I:12166;406;life tale of longshot going up against extraordinary odds.
I:12166;407;more than the boxing, however, this is a great family story of a devoted husband and father and a loving, supporting wife and mother.
I:12166;408;That's the crux of this biography, more than the boxing angle.
I:12166;409;Renee Zellweger also shines as Braddock's wife.
I:12166;410;The two make an inspiring couple which is refreshing to see in this age of cynical film.
I:12166;411;the boxing scenes, supervised by real.
I:12166;412;life Hall Of Fame trainer Angelo Dundee, are lifelike and well.
I:12166;413;Crowe did a wonderful job of imitating Braddock's ring style.
I:12166;414;Visually, this is a wonderful treat for your eyes.
I:12166;415;Director Ron Howard really excelled in capturing the 1930s Depression era with some beautifully muted colors.
I:12166;416;The sets are fantastic and the clothing, cars, buildings, etc put you smack in the middle of the 1930s.
I:12166;417;This is an inspiring movie based upon the life of James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe).
I:12166;418;He has a had time even getting day labor work on the docks.
I:12166;419;The movie does show Baer and Braddock touching gloves after the fight, but in real life, they hugged.
I:12166;420;It is just that Baer's son is still alive as are people who cared about him and it is something that has to be acknowledged.
I:12166;421;Perfect and perfectly set up by what Ron Howard and the actors show us of the struggles during the hard years.
I:12166;422;There is some pretty exciting fight footage that can be too much for young children, but otherwise it is a fine movie and great for kids the right age to see for its good values and lessons about family and perseverance.
I:12166;423;there are fine extras on the disk about the casting and making of the movie as well as more information about Braddock and Gould.
I:12166;424;The principles in this movie are terrific, especially Crowe, Zellweger, and the fabulous Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manager and friend, Joe Gould.
I:12166;425;We read The Contender by Robert Lipsyte and this was an excellent, based on real events, film to go along with that fictional work!
I:12166;426;For a quarter century, director Ron Howard has shown consistent filmmaking prowess in a wide range of genres.
I:12166;427;based A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13) and recreates the boxing hero, James Braddock, whose life parallels the fortunes of Depression.
I:12166;428;It is one of Howard's best films.
I:12166;429;a talented boxer, Jim Braddock, ascends the ranks of boxing in the late 1920's and finds his career is jeopardized by a chance injury which cuts short any championship aspirations.
I:12166;430;"This is Braddock's second chance, and although he has everything to gain, he knows it is the biggest risk of his life
I:12166;431;what is basically a boxing movie is also a touching love story.
I:12166;432;"russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator) is such a chameleon of an actor
I:12166;433;Not only did Crowe severely trim down in weight and train to be a convincing fighter (he looks to be in incredible condition), he effortlessly inflects a New Jersey accent and inhabits a proud family man whose love for his wife and three children is matched only by his heart and desire in the boxing ring.
I:12166;434;Her shining moment comes during a fateful meeting with Max Baer at a posh restaurant where she more than holds her own.
I:12166;435;Particularly in the last fight, he gives Braddock advice and suggestions to the point you actually believe he knows what he is talking about.
I:12166;436;It is surely an Oscar caliber performance.
I:12166;437;kudos go to the production staff for vividly reconstructing the period as costumers and set decorators reimagine a dark period of history.
I:12166;438;The boxing scenes are well shot and edited in a refreshing way.
I:12166;439;It is so easy to fall into clich s, but these fights are staged with great care and realism.
I:12166;440;Editing transitions are done with good effect.
I:12166;441;While not quite as good as A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man is a well made film about an amazing comeback story with real life people that gets better as it goes along until its gutsy ending.
I:12166;442;Well cast, written and acted.
I:12166;443;Not only a touching love and family story, but an exciting boxing script with lots of action.
I:12166;444;No doubt Ron Howard is one of the finest directors in film today, his best works have included Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind.
I:12166;445;Thankfully, Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have created another excellent movie every bit as good as A Beautiful Mind.
I:12166;446;Cinderella Man relates a simple, sincere, true story about James Braddock, a humble, down and out boxer and dedicated family man who fights his way to a world championship during the Great Depression.
I:12166;447;Ron Howard is back, and he has a knockout movie in Cinderella Man.
I:12166;448;"I loved, loved this story
I:12166;449;Russell Crowe delivers the emotional and actual story with success.
I:12166;450;I was fortunate enough to watch this movie in a theater with a family friend who actually lived through the depression era.
I:12166;451;i not only enjoyed a great movie, but received a history lesson from a person who lived the movie.
I:12166;452;Remembering listening to this fight on the radio, and how it brought everyone together as a community.
I:12166;453;ray version which also has actual footage of the main event, it was simply spectacular.
I:12166;454;sincerely one of my top ten movies of all time.
I:12166;455;This movie is by far the best film I've ever seen.
I:12166;456;It shows the pure human emotion that will make you stand up and cheer at the end, not just because theres an amazing triumph, but because of WHO you are watching triumph.
I:12166;457;Crowes performance is so intence and so real that it took me a bit to realize I was watching a movie.
I:12166;458;I was actually brought to tears for Crowe and not Braddock.
I:12166;459;As fate would have it Braddock is given a chance at redemption and he takes it.
I:12166;460;winning fight after fight until he goes up against Max Baer for the title.
I:12166;461;This is by far the best boxing/family drama I've ever scene.
I:12166;462;See this movie, becasue it's worth every minute.
I:12166;463;Not only is this movie the best release in 2005, it is also Russell Crowe's best performance to date.
I:12166;464;there are so many things to love about this movie that I don't really know where to begin, but I'll try:#1.
I:12166;465;The cinematography is captivating, drawing the audience into the Great Depression and the anguish that it was.
I:12166;466;more so than any movie I can think of.
I:12166;467;Russell Crowe seemed to transform himself into the boxer, Jim Braddock, and I have never seen Crowe perform this good.
I:12166;468;Ren e Zellweger works magic in her role as Braddock's wife, Mae.
I:12166;469;Paul Giamatti rises to the occasion, with a superb reincarnation (okay, that's an exaggeration) of Joe Gould, Jim Braddock's friend and manager.
I:12166;470;This is the best film out this year!
I:12166;471;Crowe does a fantastic job of portraying James Braddock, aka Cinderella Man.
I:12166;472;This is a movie about not only a great boxer, but a great man, the kind of man all of us males should aspire to be.
I:12166;473;The Depression era in American history sapped the energy of the middle.
I:12166;474;Two stories lifted the spirits of ordinary people who yearned for icons of triumph in the face of staggering odds.

I:12166;479;class hero, the pride of New Jersey and the hope of the Irish.
I:12166;480;He has drawn out a riveting and impressive performance from Russell Crowe as the boxer and given Paul Giamatti a juicy role as Braddock's trainer and manager that ought to win him a Best Supporting Actor nod.
I:12166;481;in the 1920s, Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) is a winning fighter, a golden boy who is being groomed as a future champion.
I:12166;482;four years later in 1932 in the midst of the Depression, the Braddocks and their three young children are living in a one.

I:12166;488;And here is a father whose high ethical standards, such as keeping promises and being loyal through adversity, are passed on to his kids.
I:12166;489;Braddock was inwardly rich, and people recognized that in him.
I:12166;490;Cinderella Man also reveals the suffering brought about by the Great Depression.
I:12166;491;Cinderella Man tells the true story of Depression.
I:12166;492;that is, until he gets his big break and climbs back into the ring.
I:12166;493;this is an inspiring film.
I:12166;494;"tumble boxer from New Jersey
I:12166;495;"Good detail on the visuals
I:12166;496;The sound is great as well.
I:12166;497;The movie should be fine for teens, but perhaps not for smaller children.
I:12166;498;i highly recommend this movie.
I:12166;499;Ron Howard has given us characters that we can care about and root for.
I:12166;500;Rocky finds a time machine and emerges as Depression.
I:12166;501;Paul Giamatti has a great role as Braddock's manager.
I:12166;502;The synopsis/summary given on this page is very accurate, so I needn't say much, besides that this was is an excellent film.
I:12166;503;The character development is outstanding, as I was feeling for, rooting for, and basically living with, Russel Crowe's character, Braddock.
I:12166;504;The boxing scenes are graphic at times, but realistic.
I:12166;505;i would highly recommend this film to anyone.
I:12166;506;Amid a world of gray and umber colored shadows that perfectly symbolize the bleakness of the Great Depression, Ron Howard brings viewers the light of Hope in the story of boxer, Jim Braddock.
I:12166;507;russell Crowe plays this emblem of the Greatest Generation with grace, dignity, and an understated bravura.
I:12166;508;He captures Braddock's heart, spirit, and sinew magnificently, glistening with sweat as he takes on each opponent.
I:12166;509;but the end game is truly a fanfare for the Common Man, and overall, Howard has sung adequate homage to the sweetness of the American Dream, and done great justice to the pluck and determination of the Braddocks, whose virtues of faith, rescoursefulness, and support of those closest to them should be emulated by us all.
I:12166;510;I love this movie, I think it is my favorite movie of all time!
I:12166;511;it is based on a true story which makes it even better.
I:12166;512;the acting is outstanding and the sets are very realistic.
I:12166;513;A must see for everyone in the family
I:12166;514;stopper, with thrilling boxing sequences and unpredictable twists and turns, the movie teaches great family values and responsibility.
I:12166;515;Incredible movie with yet another incredible performance by Crowe!
I:12166;516;And Giamatti was excellent as well.
I:12166;517;This is the way love should be.
I:12166;518;Amazing time period captured wonderfully.
I:12166;519;This is the most heartwarming story of how life in America SHOULD BE and AT ONE TIME WAS!!!
I:12166;520;Watch it to boost your resolve to love your family!!!!
I:12166;521;When entertainment transcends its ephemeral home to capture the viewer and move him or her to an emotional groundswell of thought and reflection, the entertainment takes on an additional dimension, ultimately affecting those who have appreciated its message and its story.
I:12166;522;And the true story of James J. Braddock, so wonderfully portrayed in Ron Howard's fascinating film CINDERELLA MAN, is an absolute tribute to the rugged determination of the human spirit. . . to the never.
I:12166;523;ending journey of love and fulfillment.
I:12166;524;This movie nails human conflict, perseverance, and determination right on their collective heads, and leaves the viewer gaping in overwhelmed astonishment.
I:12166;525;"Then, miraculously, his spirited manager was able to convince the Madison Square Garden promoter to allow Jim to fill in for a boxer who couldn't make an important bout versus a formidable heavyweight contender
I:12166;526;"And while Jim began his meteoric rise through the boxing echelon, he captured the hearts and souls of a disenfranchised populace who connected with him and cheered him
I:12166;527;this is riveting material, from the recreation of Depression Era Manhattan, to the depths of poverty and want, to the exceptional storytelling, and yes, the boxing scenes, which are completely believable.
I:12166;528;But where the story ultimately triumphs, in this reviewer's opinion, is in the steadfast love and devotion of Jim and his very spirited wife, Mae (Rene Zellweger).
I:12166;529;"The film begins with Jim married to Mae, and stays the course accordingly
I:12166;530;Crowe and Zellweger exhibit flawless chemistry on screen, and it's fun and compelling to watch.
I:12166;531;paul Giamatti is fantastic as Joe Gould, Jim's long.
I:12166;532;That's good stuff, and it moved me to tears.
I:12166;533;Cinderella Man is a stylish little biopic about a down.
I:12166;534;this is a feel good family affair with heart.
I:12166;535;Crowe is great in his role as is Paul Giamatti.
I:12166;536;"It's also ""educational"" as it shows a convincing portrait of what living during the Great Depression might really have been like."
I:12166;537;It helps us to appreciate the simple abundance that we enjoy today.
I:12166;538;largely ignored in the theater, but this is a good movie and well worth watching.
I:12166;539;It is a true story that depicts an honest boxer who is his own man just as the movie is its own movie.
I:12166;540;Russell Crowe, whose conduct in private life is sometimes incomprehensible, turns in another outstanding performance, hitting just the right note in every aspect of this character study and establishing yet another star in his acting crown.
I:12166;541;His Jimmy Braddock is that increasingly rare creature.
I:12166;542;a plain, decent man who loves his wife and children and rises to astonishing levels trying to take care of them.
I:12166;543;"Crowe's performance does not exaggerate or unduly emphasize the heroic aspect of the Braddock story
I:12166;544;Paul Giamatti is terrific as Joe Gould, Braddock's manager , and the rest of the cast is uniformly excellent.
I:12166;545;The depiction of the Depression is very effective without becoming the whole story.
I:12166;546;"The movie does have a ""Seabiscuit"" kind of appeal and Braddock was obviously a figure of admiration and hope to the millions of poor and dispossessed during those years, just as Seabiscuit was."
I:12166;547;In all, this movie is a classic.
I:12166;548;while the boxing scenes (and there are a lot of them) are a little hard to take if you are not a fan of violence on the screen, they are so well done and so integral to the story that I did not find them offputting.
I:12166;549;"See this movie and see it with your family
I:12166;550;this movie has heart, great heart.
I:12166;551;edge of boxing and the depression era, and comes out with something filled with emotion, pathos, and some pretty damned good pugilism.
I:12166;552;It's hard and sweet at the same time, and it portrays a great moment in boxing history.
I:12166;553;Jim Braddock had a family, and was dedicated to that family, and his aim was toward that family surviving as a unit.
I:12166;554;There is a sweetness about him, and a warrior's heart within him.
I:12166;555;He went up against some pretty tough competition, and won out, even at an older age when no one else thought he had a shot.
I:12166;556;I want to add a note about Will Smith's portrayal as Ali.
I:12166;557;it was a good movie, and Smith was good in it, but Ali, let's face it, was always Ali, and he was probably the best.
I:12166;558;Crowe's portrayal of Jim Braddock goes beyond it.
I:12166;559;Russell Crowe scores another knockout performance as Braddock, and Ron Howard scores another directing knockout with this film.
I:12166;560;There was a tremendous chemistry between the cast members in this film.
I:12166;561;And the result was an exceptionally entertaining film.
I:12166;562;As a personal note, I enjoyed seeing one of my favorite child actresses.
I:12166;563;I highly recommend this film to anyone who has ever struggled to rise above circumstances that kept knocking them down.
I:12166;564;Personally, I have never liked boxing, but I loved this movie just for the reason stated.
I:12166;565;And because I knew that Ron Howard was a master of his trade who would not settle for less than greatness in a film.
I:12166;566;russell Crowe stars in the film as Jim Braddock.
I:12166;567;Jim Braddock and his family are living during hard times in the early 1930's during The Great Depression.
I:12166;568;Renee Zelwegger stars in the film as his wife who is doing the best she can to keep the family together.
I:12166;569;She takes her children to a better environment with other family members.
I:12166;570;Cinderella Man is one of those real period piece type of films.
I:12166;571;They did an excellent job of re.
I:12166;572;Jack's story of struggle and triumph is inspiring also.
I:12166;573;Great, true, 2nd chance story, presented well!
I:12166;574;Actors do a great job of making you feel like you were there and can relate to it.
I:12166;575;Great time period movie to give teens a visual on the Great Depression.

I:12166;581;dislocated right hand) and The Great Depression have derailed Braddock's once.
I:12166;582;promising career, and have transformed his lush lifestyle into one of low.
I:12166;583;day work on a loading dock, and the nature of the lifting coupled with the injury to his right hand develop the left counterpunch that suddenly transformed Braddock from a one.
I:12166;584;All the while, Braddock's wife provides a loving home.
I:12166;585;eventually Jim is given a one time opportunity to earn $250 for one fight (a considerable sum in those days, Depression or not) against the highly.
I:12166;586;Having thus disposed of the #2 contender, Braddock suddenly found himself back in the heavyweight picture.
I:12166;587;one thing leads to another, with Jim scoring additional victories againstprominent contenders John Henry Lewis and Art Lasky, finally setting Jim up for a showdown with Baer.
I:12166;588;Although Braddock didn't knock out Baer in their encounter, he nevertheless won in convincing fashion on points.
I:12166;589;The final fight scene, and all the fight scenes for that matter, are exciting and fast paced even if not terribly realistic.
I:12166;590;this film is very entertaining, but it is well over two hours long, and it feels like it, too.
I:12166;591;overall a worthy movie, that takes certain liberties at some places that can be reasonably written off as hyperbolic fiction.
I:12166;592;Here we see what happens when a sports movie meets the Great Depression.
I:12166;593;This is a true story, and one that is very inspiring indeed.
I:12166;594;Most sports films center around an athlete who is driven by the desire to be the best at his / her craft.
I:12166;595;the epoch in which the movie takes place makes it somewhat unique in the history of pugilism.
I:12166;596;They both do outstanding jobs.
I:12166;597;Director Ron Howard has delivered another winner.
I:12166;598;It's good that someone had the idea to tell the story of a man who lived in what is (for the most part) a forgotten time to most of us.
I:12166;599;james Braddock gets the chance of a lifetime against world heavyweight champion Max Baer due to some rather unlikely circumstances.
I:12166;600;This film does a good job of detailing the drastic consequences of having a President who is in over his / her head.
I:12166;601;The movie is artfully and well done, and the acting is very good.
I:12166;602;But the great thing about this movie is it's story.
I:12166;603;In that it is a story about an actual character and is historically based, it is even more impactual.
I:12166;604;Movie gives a great look at the depression time in our nation's history.
I:12166;605;I highly recommend the movie.
I:12166;606;"The title "" Cinderella Man "" may imply some sort of sappy love story and keep the macho man away, but actually it is one of the most inspirational films I've ever seen."
I:12166;607;Crowe gives a stellar performance as the down but never out boxer and you will sometimes believe you're watching a documentary.
I:12166;608;Crowe, Zellweger, Giamatti are superb ( Giamatti as Jimmy's manager should have won best supporting Oscar!)
I:12166;609;This is truly an outstanding tale.
I:12166;610;It captures the spirit of Jimmy Braddock's life.
I:12166;611;I highly recommend viewing this movie.
I:12166;612;With only a few, notable exceptions (The Missing, Willow, both of which he directed, NOT produced), Ron Howard once has again created a wonderful story on film with Cinderella Man.
I:12166;613;In 2005, filmgoers know that Howard will generally produce well.
I:12166;614;directed, and enjoyable stories, and this is no exception.
I:12166;615;luck boxer, James J. Braddock is inspirational.
I:12166;616;Braddock, portrayed by Russell Crowe, forced to battle for day work at the New Jersey docks during the throes of the Great Depression, must gather the will and courage to overcome his boxing injuries and reenter the ring.
I:12166;617;in and take a beating from a championship contender because the original boxer on the opposite side card had to be scratched.
I:12166;618;As the unlikely series of events unfold for Braddock that eventually lead to a title fight with Max Baer (Craig Bierko), Braddock wins the love and respect of the hundreds of thousands of families who were affected by the Great Depression.
I:12166;619;When Braddock defeats Baer for the heavyweight title, the audience stood up and cheered!Solidarity!Crowe and Zellweger as Mr. and Mrs. James J. Braddock are very solid, as was Paul Giamatti in a supporting role.
I:12166;620;A powerful movie from beginning to end, Cinderella Man has a strong story with a wonderful cast, of which some of the best acting is done by Paul Giamatti.
I:12166;621;I'm not a big fan of boxing myself, but I have t say that the action here is very balanced and entertaining.
I:12166;622;What also makes Cinderella Man so unique is the way the camera moves around and films.
I:12166;623;It portrays movement, moods,and the setting perfectly.
I:12166;624;A great uplifting saga set in the midst of the Great Depression.
I:12166;625;He captures the Damon Runyon banter with New Joisey accents, and makes you feel every body jarring clash in the boxing ring.
I:12166;626;"The everyman hero of the Depression theme has, of course, been told many times before, notably in ""Seabiscuit"" and the great Australian movie ""Phar Lap"", but Howard makes this new mythology fresh and inspiring, even for those of us who know nothing about boxing."
I:12166;627;"The portrayl of Max Bayer, the champion boxer who in real life was the father of the actor who played ""Jethro"" from ""The Beverley Hillbillies"", is great point for trivia fans."
I:12166;628;This film has not only great actors but it has a great discription of how middle class families and everyone else was greatly impacted by the great depression!
I:12166;629;the price was wonderful and the delivery came in just 3 days!!!
I:12166;630;"As he proved with 1995's ""Apollo 13"", director Ron Howard has an innate capacity of taking a well."
I:12166;631;This time out, he takes a well.
I:12166;632;He unexpectedly confounds the bookmakers and wins, which eventually leads him to a shot at the title against the heavily.
I:12166;633;"For example, the details around Madison Square Garden and the ""Hooverville"" in Central Park feel genuine, and when Braddock hits rock bottom and begs for money from his backers, the scene has an unflinching honesty about how his humiliation has been superseded by his need to get his children back from relatives."
I:12166;634;it certainly helps to have Russell Crowe portray Braddock in a committed performance that would make Spencer Tracy proud.
I:12166;635;"While it doesn't rank with his subtly complex work in ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"", his heroic performance is top."
I:12166;636;The film's other sturdy performance comes from Paul Giamatti, who gives Joe a humanistic spirit that provides Braddock his path toward victory.
I:12166;637;"lip devotion, spouting the script's most sentimental lines (""You are the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!"")"
I:12166;638;it's intriguing that for all the old.
I:12166;639;fashioned drama developed toward the final bout, that the more penetrating insight in the movie comes from how the period of FDR's New Deal really did not provide a timely response to the people who faced the degradation of poverty and starvation.
I:12166;640;"The most interesting addition though is about the subject himself, ""Jim Braddock: The Friends and Family Behind The Legend""."
I:12166;641;I have to give it to Ron Howard on this one.
I:12166;642;He's made quite a wonderful and entertaining film.
I:12166;643;that having been said, this movie is still a great one.
I:12166;644;It tugs at the heart strings and teaches a great moral lesson.
I:12166;645;if you watch this movie, enjoy it for what it is.
I:12166;646;A good movie with a great moral.
I:12166;647;But the movie is well worth watching, so long as you don't put too much stock in Hollywood's respect of historical fact.
I:12166;648;This movie is one of the best movies of the last ten years.
I:12166;649;His responsiblity to his family and as a father is outstanding.
I:12166;650;One scene that really moved me was when they had nothing to eat but a couple of slices of bologna.
I:12166;651;Yea this is a good film, When You Pair Ron Howard and Russell Crowe Your bound to get a good movie experiance.
I:12166;652;It's an awesome experience true story, that we will watch over and over again.
I:12166;653;I added this film to my US History curriculum so my students can have a visual understanding of the Great Depression.
I:12166;654;The boys in the class also loved the boxing scenes.
I:12166;655;The girls loved everything but the boxing scenes.
I:12166;656;This wonderful true story has an underlining moral message for all people.
I:12166;657;My response is always: it's a true story, based on a real boxer, during a time in US history that was a struggle for survival, and that you will see.
I:12166;658;Worth every second of your time.
I:12166;659;Another fine performance by Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti.
I:12166;660;he is one of the best character actors out there.)
I:12166;661;Crowe did a wonderful job portraying James Braddock, displaying a tender side of the man few actors could.
I:12166;662;He has an easiness about him that was endearing.
I:12166;663;I would hope so, but the scene was really touching.
I:12166;664;He swallows his pride, once again to take care of his family.
I:12166;665;And that is what this movie is truly about .
I:12166;666;what a man (or woman) would do to take care of the ones they love.
I:12166;667;i highly recommend this movie .
I:12166;668;But it is a surprisingly engaging movie despite being overly sentimental in places.
I:12166;669;I feel the demonization of Max Baer added an unecessary Hollywood touch to an otherwise likeable and realistic yarn.
I:12166;670;Very underrated movie, a great story of a man on his way up then to the bottom and given one chance gets back to the top again.
I:12166;671;Ron Howard directs this heartwarming true story about down and out boxer Jim Braddock, brilliantly played by Russell Crowe.
I:12166;672;Braddock is then thrust into the spotlight by his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) to make one of the greatest comebacks in boxing history.
I:12166;673;Cinderella Man is the best boxing movie of all time.
I:12166;674;Dazzling cinematography, editing and the most amazing boxing scenes in a movie to date.
I:12166;675;Russell Crowe gives the best performance of his career and other great performances by a supporting cast that includes Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko.
I:12166;676;One of the most dramatic and inspiring movies you'll ever see.
I:12166;677;it shows a real man, his commitment to his wife and family, endurance and not giving up.
I:12166;678;Great movie giving you an insight of how the depression affected family life and the struggles they had to go through.
I:12166;679;Anyone who thinks that Russell Crowe doesn't deserve an oscar nomination for this performance should watch the movie again!This is a truly inspirational story .
I:12166;680;made ever more inspirational through the raw and beautiful way the story is told both by exceptional direction and a stellar cast.
I:12166;681;Russell Crowe is at his best and his performance only confirms his exceptional talent and total discipline in being 'at one' with his character.
I:12166;682;The fight scenes are shot magnificently making the viewer feel as though they are actually in the ring!
I:12166;683;Renee Zellweger' character and all the other supporting characters are well developed throughout the film, with again an outstanding discipline from the actors and raw reality.
I:12166;684;Such a well made and thoroughly thought provoking film.
I:12166;685;As usual both Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger make outstanding performances in Cinderella Man.
I:12166;686;They are both fabulous actors anyway but this movie comes together nicely!
I:12166;687;They compliment each other well as husband and wife .
I:12166;688;The dialog is solid, the acting is solid, the setting is solid .
I:12166;689;I haven't walked away feeling great from a good, well written solid movie in a long time!
I:12166;690;Cinderella Man is the perfect cherry on top of the sundae.
I:12166;691;I love this movie as it wasn't just another BOXING flick.
I:12166;692;I shared this with my Dad who grew up in this era.
I:12166;693;One of Russell Crowe and Renee Z.'s best movies out there.
I:12166;694;Good acting and good story all around, full of hope.
I:12166;695;America loves an underdog movie, where the good guys will win.
I:12166;696;Also, the persistence of the boxer makes the hair on your arm stand up.
I:12166;697;I have seen this movie at least six times, and I am inspired every time.
I:12166;698;I enjoyed it a lot.
I:12166;699;I am impressed with Rusell Crowe's acting in The Insider, Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, and now in this superb movie.
I:12166;700;Congratulations and thanks also to the director, supporting actors and the rest of the team who made it possible.
I:12166;701;Ron Howard does an effective job telling the story with the right balance of drama and mood.
I:12166;702;the first half of Cinderella Man moved a little slow, but I think it really captures what Depression.
I:12166;703;This is really where Cinderella Man shines, and the symbol of Braddock's character is emphasized.
I:12166;704;"Braddock represents the poor and impoverished, and goes into that title fight a huge underdog
I:12166;705;still, Cinderella Man is a great film, where the director manages to make a boxing film without really making a boxing film.
I:12166;706;"This is a film about overcoming obstacles, about making it in a harsh world
I:12166;707;The scenery and music score also give the film an authentic feel to its setting and times.
I:12166;708;the extras are worth a look, too, especially the commentary about the film.
I:12166;709;As a movie about the Great Depression, and that tells a true story, it does much the same thing that Seabiscuit does.
I:12166;710;one of the best parts of this one: the supporting.
I:12166;711;Enjoyed this true life story in a movie.
I:12166;712;This movie is a great movie to watch with your wife and or your family.
I:12166;713;Finally a good movie with a good plot that does not have much foul language.
I:12166;714;great movie//also Angelo Dundee is cameod in the movie in Braddocks corner.
I:12166;715;great movieworth anyones time and money to but it
I:12166;716;Not often will you see a movie that is primarily a factual reporting of history with a good storyline and excellent acting.
I:12166;717;"respect, family and determination, capsulizes the essence of what makes America truly great
I:12166;718;Rarely, if ever, will you see a better representation of the right person, in the right place at the right time, rising to the challenges thrust upon them through no fault of their own, than in this production.
I:12166;719;Let's face it, when given the opportunity, Ron Howard knows how to make tell a great story.
I:12166;720;Renee Zellweger is surprisingly effective in the presence of Russell Crowe and they convey a simple but solid chemistry.
I:12166;721;Paul Giamatti is simply one of the best character actors in film today.
I:12166;722;but after reluctantly watching this film, I have to say he has a brilliant talent.
I:12166;723;Cinderella Man is a heartwarming and touching, and in the end inspirational film.
I:12166;724;if you want to see a well directed, well acted, inspirational film this is the one.
I:12166;725;This is a good film but I don't understand why put it on a blu.
I:12166;726;Definetly an excellent acting by the two protagonists, especially the wife.
I:12166;727;This is strongly recommended when somebody wants to see good acting with real story behind it.
I:12166;728;acted, history of a famous boxer 80 years ago.
I:12166;729;based on the lives and careers of real fighters.
I:12166;730;Juxtaposed to these we have enjoyed divers stalwart champions of fiction.
I:12166;731;it is based on the very true story of unheralded James J. Braddock.
I:12166;732;the actual heavyweight champion from 1935.1937.
I:12166;733;He held the title for just over a year.
I:12166;734;The film gets most of the real history correct.
I:12166;735;and his comeback was miraculous.
I:12166;736;It was our good fortune that Ron Howard stepped up and took the reins of command.
I:12166;737;It became a very personal and powerful statement in his hands.
I:12166;738;This might be his best film.
I:12166;739;Oscar will surely come calling.
I:12166;740;russell Crowe was incredibly good as Braddock.
I:12166;741;sparring with pro fighters and getting injured several times.
I:12166;742;He found the sweetness and goodness in Braddock.
I:12166;743;The cinematography was stunning by new lenser Salvatore Totino.
I:12166;744;He created living post cards from the the 1930's.
I:12166;745;icons that smacked of the raw Warner's 1930 look.
I:12166;746;I thought she made some interesting choices.
I:12166;747;she probably will be nominated for an Oscar along with several others just for being in this powerhouse of a picture.
I:12166;748;the terrifically versatile Paul Giamatti played manager Joe Gould.
I:12166;749;probably infusing more humanity into the character than actually existed in real life.
I:12166;750;His Gould knew how to create a buck, but he had a compassionate side too.
I:12166;751;Giamatti pulls out all the stops and is flat wonderful in the role.
I:12166;752;i really liked this film.
I:12166;753;perhaps Ron Howard's best directorial effort and Russell Crowe's finest performance.
I:12166;754;It resonates with truth and beats with a great and tender heart.
I:12166;755;This is a great movie.
I:12166;756;went and ordered it right after I watched it on tv.
I:12166;757;that's why I'm a prime member.
I:12166;758;The picture was crisp and the sound perfect.
I:12166;759;If you love boxing movies this is a must!
I:12166;760;Wonderful story of a wonderful American!
I:12166;761;A true family movie, where the wife and children motivate the father to unthinkable achievment.
I:12166;762;Bravery, fear, want, need and greed all combine to form the best inside a man.
I:12166;763;"blow"" action is very full."
I:12166;764;It's about hope, hard work, and the love of a good woman (and family)!
I:12166;765;It is also one of the finest films depicting the Great Depression in the 1930s that is a timely moment for us all to remember.
I:12166;766;Despite his advancing age, broken hands, fallen reputation, and challenged ego, Jim manages to sustain his spirit and fights for the survival of his family.
I:12166;767;ron Howard directs this story of a man's indomitable spirit with a fine sense of pacing and manages to hold this two and a half hour movie together without a moment of wasted time.
I:12166;768;With cinematographer Salvatore Totino and musical score writer Thomas Newman he manages to recreate the gray brown mood of the Great Depression better than any film to date.
I:12166;769;There are small supporting roles that truly shine: the grossly underused Paddy Considine, Craig Bierko, and Bruce McGill among them are beautifully carved creations.
I:12166;770;Russell Crowe gives his most understated, credible role and truly inhabits 'Cinderella Man' (his moniker) as a desperately needed hero of the people of the Depression Era.
I:12166;771;Ren e Zellweger once again plays, well.
I:12166;772;The surprising acting comes from the solid support by Paul Giamatti.
I:12166;773;If he isn't nominated for best supporting actor then people aren't watching!CINDERELLA MAN is a strong film, one that sweeps you up and carries you along .
I:12166;774;It really gives you the feel not only of what the depression forced American citizens to endure but it also give you a look into the life of boxing as it used to be.
I:12166;775;Times are tough all over, but you gotta do what you gotta do, even if you tearfully promised your son, on word of honor, that you'd never split up the family.
I:12166;776;The leads and supporting cast are excellent, the historic details are meticulous, blah, blah, blah, but it's the horrific edge of World Boxing Champ Max Baer, he killed some guys in the ring, played by Craig Bierko, that gives the film reason to rally around the hero and strike up a round of 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow'.
I:12166;777;DIRECTIONI havent been following Ron Howard's filmography but Cinderella Man is one film that catches you just when you're least expecting.
I:12166;778;Every scene in the film has a certain bit of life that leads to the climax of the film.
I:12166;779;The Camerawork is astonishing most of the times and the language of the film has the kind of subtlety that classics do.
I:12166;780;I would actually go as far as saying that the score of Cinderella Man outdoes his previous work(Road To Perdition) The ambient instrumenal music adds to the impact the snow creates.
I:12166;781;I found this queer,strange and very interesting.
I:12166;782;Russel Crowe alone carries this epic with very mature flawless performances by Renee Zewellger and the kids.
I:12166;783;cinderella Man is confident,disquieting and unbelievable at times.
I:12166;784;now, I think that pretty much sums up this film.
I:12166;785;Cinderella Man is a wonderful movie, a movie that has you wiping away a tear, sitting at the edge of your seat, thinking about life, and feeling good at the end.
I:12166;786;Russell Crowe is one of the greatest actors alive today.
I:12166;787;Paul Giamatti is also terrific as Joe Gould.
I:12166;788;He is perfect with Russell Crowe.
I:12166;789;Since all of the other reviewers have already gone over what the movie is about, I will just say that if you want an uplifting movie with solid performances by everyone in the film, this is it.
I:12166;790;The hardships he went through during the depression and his American never quitting attitude is an inspiration to all of us.
I:12166;791;Such a great TRUE STORY movie!!
I:12166;792;starring Russel Crowe as Bradock he delivers a convincing performance and he obviously spent time boxing and training because he has the physicality of the real Bradock.
I:12166;793;Bradock is kind and has no darkness about him like so many film heroes, this is refreshing as he is depicted as a good man, who only fights for his family.
I:12166;794;He even works a manual labour job with a broken wrist at one point.
I:12166;795;The next part is the fighting which is great and realistic.
I:12166;796;overall this is an entertaining film that isn't in the emotional league of Raging Bull or Million Dollar Baby, but holds its own and is a film worth seeing.
I:12166;797;Crowe gives another excellent performance and was great choice to play Jim Bradock.7/10
I:12166;798;Cinderella Man is a good historical movie, set in the great depression and based on James Braddock, a boxer who overcame all odds.
I:12166;799;He is played with great poise by Russell Crowe.
I:12166;800;and Rennee Zellwegger does a good job as his wife.
I:12166;801;so the acting is good for one.
I:12166;802;The boxing is realistic and all but.
I:12166;803;so yeah, it's a good movie with good acting but it's just not original.
I:12166;804;Oh and yeah, Million Dollar Baby is a better movie.
I:12166;805;sure it's a good movie, but it's not original.
I:12166;806;And originality is something that I find to be important in movies.
I:12166;807;Victim of the Great Depression, Braddock possessed a true steel frame of mind.
I:12166;808;in the Thirties there were two admirable sport feats: the most famous was obviously this one and the another was the impressive triumph of Jose Capablanca in Chess.
I:12166;809;ron Howard was wonderful around this dazzling handle camera.
I:12166;810;Crowe made an towering performance specially with that premonitory gaze when he saw Baer with Primo Carnera.
I:12166;811;Special applauses to Rene Zellweger and Grimanti who looked very fresh and engaging with that role.
I:12166;812;a winner film under any perspective you look at.
I:12166;813;The film was perfectly titled.
I:12166;814;This is a movie that showed a man who had integrity and compassion.
I:12166;815;He was a man of his word.
I:12166;816;This is a feel good movie.
I:12166;817;This movie is well scripted, well acted and well edited.
I:12166;818;It is one of the best boxing flicks I ever watched.
I:12166;819;"The tale is NOT about the fighting
I:12166;820;It is about a man who holds dear the values our society seemingly lacks today: family, dedication, and the work ethic.
I:12166;821;It's a truly moving film that was just right for that special day.
I:12166;822;It's about true love, mutual understanding and friendship.
I:12166;823;Many scenes touch on human emotions, especially the family scenes.
I:12166;824;Russell Crowe was very well prepared both physically and mentally.
I:12166;825;The boxing scenes appear absolutely realistic.
I:12166;826;Paul Giamatti as the boxing manager is exceptional.
I:12166;827;His facial expressions are amazing.
I:12166;828;Renee Zellwegger as the adoring wife is also very well chosen.
I:12166;829;Even if you know the outcome, there is still suspense.
I:12166;830;There is rich dialogue and some humor.
I:12166;831;Ron Howard delivers a story of underdog and triumph of Human Spirit.
I:12166;832;I would recommend this movie to any person who is felling low in life.
I:12166;833;amazing Movie, Go for it.
I:12166;834;It is in my opinion one of the best dramas this year.
I:12166;835;Great movie that follows along the actual true story very well .
I:12166;836;Great performances and a real insight into the depression.
I:12166;837;Very inspiring movie of the kind of person we all want to be.
I:12166;838;I really enjoyed this film, i was hooked from the beging to the end.
I:12166;839;The story is excellent about a man trying to feed his family during the great deoresion.
I:12166;840;The acting was excellent and I think Crowe, and Zellwiger should be nominated for oscars.
I:12166;841;The movie is real and has a big heart espially whne Crowe makes his son return the meat he stole.
I:12166;842;Overall one of 2005 best films.
I:12166;843;As with all based on real event movies this is slightly inaccurate but what can you do.
I:12166;844;It has great actors and brutal fight scenes.
I:12166;845;Cinderella Man is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:12166;846;The fight scenes will thrill the fan, but the story will touch the hearts of all.
I:12166;847;As for the church picnic, the community's rallying around Braddock and, in the midst of his own distress, his help to a friend in greater need, well I have lived through all of that.
I:12166;848;This is one of the best to teach the value of TEAMWORK in marriage.
I:12166;849;The unique facial features are all there.
I:12166;850;the movie was great by the way.
I:12166;851;Russell Crowe deserved an Oscar for this portrayal.
I:12166;852;Director Ron Howard has revealed once again that his talent for encouraging actors to perform at their peak is still evident.
I:12166;853;All in all, Crowe and his co. stars, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti and Craig Bierko offer a remarkable segment out of the famous boxer's life and creates a landmark of excitement and entertainment destined to please audiences for generations to come.
I:12166;854;A fun and compassionate film for those with heart.
I:12166;855;"I'm a VERY tough movie critic
I:12166;856;It's a very compelling story of a real American.
I:12166;857;He's committed to his country, wife, and kids as a man should be.
I:12166;858;I highly recommend this for family viewing.
I:12166;859;i thought this was one of the best movies of all time.
I:12166;860;Direction was superb by Ron Howard (I'll seek out and see any Ron Howard film).
I:12166;861;I also thought this was a great role for Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger.
I:12166;862;I can either dislike or like performances of each of those actors.
I:12166;863;This was a great fit for both.
I:12166;864;The period presentation of the late 20's and early 30's was wonderful too.
I:12166;865;Finally the story was satisfying with the solid husband.
I:12166;866;family relationship and the honesty and integrety of the true life character James Braddock.
I:12166;867;It was uplifting and inspiring.
I:12166;868;The crowd cheered when the credits rolled at the theater showing I attended.
I:12166;869;I can see why: this is a family.
I:12166;870;friendly movie that many will love and wish to imitate.
I:12166;871;Crowe's Braddock hesitates to sign up for aid and returns the funds as soon as he earns good money again.
I:12166;872;This is true even though Americans wrongfully think that every American is middle class.
I:12166;873;A true story told during the depression era with all the trappings and desperation of that era shown throughout the film.
I:12166;874;This should become an american classic.
I:12166;875;Crowe does an amazing job of portraying the too.
I:12166;876;true boxer without becoming maudlin.
I:12166;877;He exhibits a quiet dignity throughout the movie.
I:12166;878;Rene Z. as his wife and Giamatti as his manager are great as well.
I:12166;879;The movie also focuses on the minor characters and the milieu of the depression era.
I:12166;880;One of the best scenes is when the wife goes to the local parish to pray for her husband and finds the church already full of people praying for him.
I:12166;881;I took off a star because it is a story told so many times.
I:12166;882;Cinderella Man is an extraordinary movie about an extraordinary man, James Braddock during an especially difficult time in America's history.
I:12166;883;"It is deeply ingrained in the psyche of America to root for the underdog
I:12166;884;russell Crowe and Renne Zellwegger are very impressive in their roles, certainly headed for awards in this fine performance.
I:12166;885;The grittiness, hopelessness and desperation of depression America is powerfully portrayed in this beautiful film.
I:12166;886;This was a wonderful movie.
I:12166;887;The plot moved forward in every scene.
I:12166;888;This may be Russell Crowe's best performance.
I:12166;889;The fact that this film was based on a true story made it even better.
I:12166;890;In the midst of summer blockbusters comes this brilliant story of a downtrodden man overcoming overwhelming odds to survive.
I:12166;891;Cinderella Man is a classic tale and a refreshing story of hope.
I:12166;892;the Great Depression is magnificently depicted in this movie.
I:12166;893;The day to day struggle to find work is a major feature in the storyline and serves to push us into feeling the pain that the people who lived the Depression felt daily.
I:12166;894;russell Crowe, an actor that I usually don't find myself cheering for, is brilliant in his depiction of the boxer, James J Braddock.
I:12166;895;Renee Zellweger, turns in a surprisingly good performance as his loving and faithful wife.
I:12166;896;Paul Giamatti, is finally emerging as one of the great supporting actors in modern cinema.
I:12166;897;His performance as Braddock's manager and friend is striking and brilliant.
I:12166;898;This would have been an interesting side story, but even without this the movie is a glorious relief to watch.
I:12166;899;Great for my History classroom when we are studying the Great Depression right before Christmas break!
I:12166;900;A cinematic delight that hails back to a time when movies treat to watch.
I:12166;901;Russel Crowe did a marvelous job portraying legendary boxer James Braddock.
I:12166;902;The real performance though in my opinion came from Paul Giamatti as his friend and manager.
I:12166;903;It is another movie from Ron Howard so you know it is directed masterfully.
I:12166;904;This movie will make you laugh, cry, and really appreciate all you have.
I:12166;905;Russell Crowe is magnificent as boxer James Braddock .
I:12166;906;A real life true story of a ROCKY bravo Well Done !!!!!!
I:12166;907;"russell Crowe does a phenomenal job of playing this humble man who, when asked by the press why he fights so passionately, replies simply:""Milk""."
I:12166;908;jim Braddock was not obsessed with boxing, nor was he determined to makeit his life's vocation: he simply loved his family and his wife, and forthem he was willing to take the hardest punches from some of the strongest and most ambitious contenders of his era.
I:12166;909;in the beginning of the film we see Braddock, a savvy businessman and an up and coming fighter doing very well for himself, like everyone was in those days.
I:12166;910;He has a dedicated trainer, Joe Gould, played by Paul Giamatti.
I:12166;911;Giamatti does a good job of portraying the fiery, all New.York manager who could talk his way into some of the most astonishing business deals and who rivalled Don King in his ability to make spectacular fights happen.
I:12166;912;The amount of somehow good natured obscenities that run from this guy's mouth from the beginning to the end of this film only endear him more to the viewer for some peculiar reason.
I:12166;913;He works on the docks with other men, and befriends a particularly angry man who, despite his love for his family, is determined to organize some kind of workers' strike.
I:12166;914;In one of the most piercing scenes in the film, Braddock searches for his friend and finds him dead the shacks in Central Park.
I:12166;915;"braddock is all grit and good will, not even allowing his child to steal from the butcher when they are practically starving
I:12166;916;Howard does a great job during the brutal fight scenes of his family running through his mind, rendering surrender impossible.
I:12166;917;This leads, of course, to his legendary bout with the fierce Max Baer.
I:12166;918;anyway, Crowe does a fantastic job of depicting a man who had nothing and, through his own willpower and determination, rose back to the top in a dangerous sport all for the welfare of his family.
I:12166;919;All feel good BS aside, James Braddock is and always will be a hero of conscience for the American public.
I:12166;920;Russell Crowe was exceptional in the role of James Braddock and Paul Giamatti was great as his manager.
I:12166;921;A positive against all odds, the power of personal determination, love, and family .
I:12166;922;I loved it when I saw it in the theater.
I:12166;923;I highly recommend this film.
I:12166;924;this Is A Must See.
I:12166;925;Ron Howard did a great job with this movie.
I:12166;926;You will understand what family values are all about.
I:12166;927;This is just a great movie about conservative principles that made this country great.
I:12166;928;Cinderella Man is a great movie both in terms of a sports tale and a historical portrait.
I:12166;929;the best reason to watch this movie is for perspective.
I:12166;930;Raise your friggin fists and fight!
I:12166;931;The voices belonged to those ever.
I:12166;932;diminishing elements like the American spirt, honor, hope, the indomitable will.
I:12166;933;They are all here, in the form of one man and those who treated him like the light of hope itself .
I:12166;934;I highly recommend Cinderella Man to anyone.
I:12166;935;That's a rare thing with today's movies.
I:12166;936;the film is certainly a period piece but it is also timeless as it depicts a family's struggle for survival while maintaining integrity and self.
I:12166;937;The historical context (the Great Depression) can be blamed for boxer James J. Braddock's patriarchal tendencies, but they are nicely balanced by Mae Braddock's independent spirit and strength.
I:12166;938;"While this is a film about work ethic, it deals equally with second chances, and that is a combination to which good people aspire, and why this ""based."
I:12166;939;The most moving and inspirational movieyou will ever watch.
I:12166;940;Shortly before 'Cinderella Man' finally made it to the screen there are a few films I feel match the eye witness perspective 'Cinderella Man' creates and takes to a new level.
I:12166;941;the first is 2002's 'Blue Crush' that take you inside waves likenever before.
I:12166;942;If by any chance your world had been knocked off kilter, with the unconventional nature of `The Missing' those who missed the opening titles without the world spinning around, will be relieved to see the world has been put right again by Ron.
I:12166;943;He'll take us back in time instead like one of his most beloved films 'Apollo 13' from 1995, but keep our world spinning while we stand stranded in the space of a boxing ring.
I:12166;944;An impeccable cast awaits her.
I:12166;945;It is a name given by playwright Damon Runyon, best known perhaps for his `Guys and Dolls' play.
I:12166;946;This movie is for anyone who admires stirring true stories with enough punch to keep the movie running smoothly.
I:12166;947;It does have all the elements of life with its dark and light moments.
I:12166;948;In spectacular, unsurpassable modern day photo Polaroid.
I:12166;949;The dizzying, spinning nature of the camera would do the infamous washing machine line of the late Jean Howard's in `Apollo 13' proud.
I:12166;950;This does however feel like best picture, or at the very least Best Actor material for Russell Crowe who missed out on an award for his portrayal of John Nash in `A Beautiful Mind'.
I:12166;951;Fists fly and Ron and Russell's talents really shine bright and director of photography Salvatore Totino pursue in the fight scenes something never before seen on film before.
I:12166;952;While `Million Dollar Baby' got awards for it's story of a female boxer and the torment she sustains within the ring, this film goes much further, and holds more truth.
I:12166;953;This film has equal measures of both a moving real.
I:12166;954;life Depression story, and the most exceptional boxing scenes ever to grace the silver screen.
I:12166;955;These scenes and this film have an unmistakeable realness to them and a gritty, sweaty atmosphere to scenes that seep through the screen to leave you speechless, sticky and gasping for air at this spectacle before you.
I:12166;956;Bound to be an instant classic, and with themes that shall always ring true.
I:12166;957;`Cinderella Man' is a real story about the hero in all of us fighting to break out no matter who our great adversaries are that we must face.
I:12166;958;Once you read the story of this man's life, I hope you hold it with as much reverence as fans of J. r. r. Tolkien and `The Lord of the Rings' do with their beloved trilogy.
I:12166;959;Miracles can happen and dreams really can come true.
I:12166;960;This film will make history.
I:12166;961;Great show of time period with a hard luck character getting his 2nd chance.
I:12166;962;I find it very inspirational.
I:12166;963;perfect marriage though one battered by poverty, and many moviegoers will find that a refreshing change to the usual Hollywood depiction of marriages.
I:12166;964;Paul Giamatti turns in his usual brilliant acting as the manager.
I:12166;965;All of the minor characters are excellent.
I:12166;966;"braddock has great pride
I:12166;967;In his fighting comeback he becomes the great hero of the working Irish.
I:12166;968;His title fight with Max Baer (depicted as a monster and dirty fighter) is of epic proportions.
I:12166;969;It's an underdog success story, and is a well.
I:12166;970;Though it has some of the clich s of the boxing movie genre, it surmounts these and keeps the audience involved and committed.
I:12166;971;Both stars, Russell Crowe and Renne Zellwegger wanted to do this.
I:12166;972;Crowe might be the best actor of our time and is simply very believable as the humble, honorable, boxer, James Braddock.
I:12166;973;They are a loyal couple, in love and have three young kids.
I:12166;974;Paul Giamatti does anther great turn as Jim's agent, who never turns his back on his best friend.
I:12166;975;Crowe has several tender scenes with his little girl and little boy.
I:12166;976;Howard gives us a good feel for the great depression that engulfed America.
I:12166;977;He captures the despair of the millions of people it ruined and beat down.
I:12166;978;The depression came and Jim busted up his hand.
I:12166;979;He gets a second chance and rides it to the top.
I:12166;980;This movie is recommended for all.
I:12166;981;This was very good and highlighted the fact that this was a well edited film.
I:12166;982;While there is some adult language, it didn't detract from the overall lesson and she also loved the story.
I:12166;983;I also recommend reading Cinderella Man by Jeremy Schaap to get the accurate story about James Braddock and Max Baer.
I:12166;984;the book sets the story historically accurate.
I:12166;985;This movie is a true story that everyone will appreciate.
I:12166;986;The hard times experienced during the depression makes it a classic everyone can enjoy.
I:12166;987;Thank you for the fast delivery as well.
I:12166;988;"It turns out I absolutely loved ""Million Dollar Baby"" and of course that film went on to be named Best Picture of the year at the Academy Awards."
I:12166;989;"Russell Crowe (whom I have always felt was overrated in both ""Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"") turns in what is easily the best perfomance of the year."
I:12166;990;"A tender, heartfelt performance that can be compared to Wallace Beery's perfomance in the orignal ""The Champ"" (which won him an Oscar in 1931) in some ways."
I:12166;991;Zellweger is good as Crowe's devoted and caring wife.
I:12166;992;"ron Howard directors the brillant cast in what I feel to be his best movie since 1995's ""Apollo 13,"" and like ""Apollo 13"" ""Cinderalla Man"" will most likely remain at the number one spot on my top ten list this year."
I:12166;993;This is a phenominal story of the late,great James J. Braddock.
I:12166;994;russel Crowe again puts on a spectacular performace as well as making the physicaly transformation into a boxer.
I:12166;995;paul Giamatti is also a fantastic on screen presence and puts on a great performance as Braddock's manager&trainer,as well as Renee' Zelweger as Braddock's wife,the very fabric and drive of his will to succeed.
I:12166;996;all together,with an excelent plot/screenplay and great directing yet again by Ron Howard this is a film you should not miss,and is well worth owning.
I:12166;997;this is an oscar contender,and I wouldn't be surprised if it even takes home a few at the same time.
I:12166;998;russell Crowe continues to add to his brilliant resume with another absorbing performance, this time as the proud Depression era boxing champ James Braddock, who fights not for glory but to put food on his family's table.
I:12166;999;So, you've got a great actor delivering a great performance, and director Ron Howard is at the top of his game, as well.
I:12166;1000;"All I can say is that here, just as he did in ""Apollo 13"" and again ""A Beautiful Mind,"" he delivers a moving, rousing, deeply engrossing and entertaining movie, though many know how it will end."
I:12166;1001;"the one major Oscar nomination ""A Cinderella Man"" landed was for Paul Giamatti's supporting role as Braddock's devoted ."
I:12166;1002;Cinderella Man was the best movie I saw in what I considered a down year for film.
I:12166;1003;"Much better than ""Rocky,"" ""Cinderella Man"" is an American classic."
I:12166;1004;It shows the desperation and the triumph of a family that is able to remain whole during the worst of times while others around them are not so lucky.
I:12166;1005;This is without a doubt one of the best boxing movies of all time.
I:12166;1006;The dipiction of the Depression, those heartbreaking times, the acting, the color, the realisim, the essence of the charactors portrayed was superb.
I:12166;1007;The story reflects the fighter's grit, determination, integrity, and what was refreshing, devotion to wife and family.
I:12166;1008;A truly wonderful film of the human spirit and dignity at its best.
I:12166;1009;This is such a Great movie about coming back from the worse that can happen to you and rising above it
I:12166;1010;Everything about my experience with Amazon was great.
I:12166;1011;The movie is a good one.
I:12166;1012;Just an all around entertaining movie!!!!
I:12166;1013;The whole family enjoyed it.
I:12166;1014;They are all interesting, but the deleted scenes are outstanding.
I:12166;1015;they were deleted mainly to shorten the time of the movie, and are wonderful additions.
I:12166;1016;great acting, good little extras for the story.
I:12166;1017;This is another great sports movie that will most likely be up for academy awards.
I:12166;1018;As much as I hate Russell Crowe his performance as Jim Braddock is really good as usual Crowe does another good performance as in A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator he does it again in Cinderella Man.
I:12166;1019;As are the performances of Ren e Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are really good to.
I:12166;1020;For the most part this was a good movie.
I:12166;1021;Max Baer was actually, in reality, quite upset that he had killed men in the ring.
I:12166;1022;I thought it interesting that this FACT was left out of the film.
I:12166;1023;brought out all the good that James J. Broderick brought to the fight game.
I:12166;1024;I think Mr. Crowe's portrayal did Mr. Broderick proud.
I:12166;1025;and I enjoyed watching it again too!
I:12166;1026;Russell Crowe does an exemplary job of depicting the humble yet relentless fighter and Renee Zellweger is his faithful and supportive wife.
I:12166;1027;Their relationship is what holds the family together during the toughest times.
I:12166;1028;This is a touching, absorbing, and thoroughly satisfying film.
I:12166;1029;We loved the story line of this movie.
I:12166;1030;Very enjoyable and has substance.
I:12166;1031;The reviews for this movie are overwhelmingly positive.
I:12166;1032;MOVIE: Cinderella Man is the true story of James Braddock who watched is entire life wither away right in front of his eyes during The Great Depression.
I:12166;1033;Then things began to go downhill, and the movie jumps right to that point in his life.
I:12166;1034;Braddock's trainer, played to perfection by Paul Giammatti, confronts him with an offer.
I:12166;1035;The film is very well made, Ron Howard adds a professional touch to the film and gives it an old fashioned feel.
I:12166;1036;The film does an excellent job of capturing post.
I:12166;1037;There are some great transitions used that will catch your eye, and the boxing scenes are filmed with perfection.
I:12166;1038;The audience really gets into the movie, your hands and body will tense up and even your heart rate may rise because the boxing scenes are very intense.
I:12166;1039;This movie could have been a bore, but Howard was able to really connect with the audience and that was the difference.
I:12166;1040;aCTING: When you have a leading actor, actress, director, producer, and composer who have all won Academy Awards you know you can expect top notch filmmaking.
I:12166;1041;They are up to par with previous performances in their history.
I:12166;1042;Giammatti portrays Braddock's manager with perfection.
I:12166;1043;Some critics believe he is the greatest character actor of all time, and I have to agree.
I:12166;1044;He really deserved it for Sideways, but what are you gonna do.
I:12166;1045;Scorsese deserves an Oscar, yes, but not for Gangs of New York or The Aviator.
I:12166;1046;Aging athlete once at the top, now at the bottom, must rise and overcome obstacles.
I:12166;1047;Sure, but the movie is still great.
I:12166;1048;bOTTOM LINE: Cinderella Man is fantastic even though you can follow the plot like a road map.
I:12166;1049;Million Dollar Baby just took in a boat load of Oscars including Best Picture, and The Contender is a popular thing on TV.
I:12166;1050;The audience I saw it with gave the film a round of applause at the end, so you can see that it is a croud pleaser.
I:12166;1051;Just thought it felt a bit intrusive, and you see it in about 10.15 shots of the film.
I:12166;1052;What a wonderful film is the thought that crossed my mind as the credits for the film rolled by.
I:12166;1053;"Russell Crowe once again proves that he is a gifted and naunced actor, and with the help of Renee Zelwegger and Paul Giamati ""Cinderalla Man,"" comes alive, and demonstrates how people endure hardships."
I:12166;1054;This film is about second chance, grace under pressure, and family.
I:12166;1055;And, it is during those trying times that this wonderful and humane boxer named James Braddox portrayed by Russell Crowe went from the nadir of his life to his zenith, and went to become a successful and rich boxer.
I:12166;1056;This is a beautiful film that is a absolute pleasure to watch from beginning to end!
I:12166;1057;Russell Crowe is the finest actor in movies today!
I:12166;1058;One of the best films I think I have ever seen.
I:12166;1059;I was rivited to the screen for much of the movie, alternating emotions between saddness, sorrow, hope, happiness, and finally, inspiration.
I:12166;1060;true story of Cinderella Man.
I:12166;1061;era sets and costumes, its lead actors' fine performances, and for Ron Howard's earnest, populist storytelling.
I:12166;1062;it's edited with wonderful rhythm, and Howard isn't afraid to take his characters to the deep bottom before he brings them to the top.
I:12166;1063;"perfect Hollywood movie
I:12166;1064;One of my top ten movies.
I:12166;1065;The acting, writing, and boxing scenes are all excellent.
I:12166;1066;This is a beautifully acted story that in my view is not really about boxing.
I:12166;1067;This movie is a character study of a man who had the courage, determination, and talent to help his family survive.
I:12166;1068;Ron Howard vividly portrayed the day.
I:12166;1069;Now he turns the tables, the real Cinderella Man.
I:12166;1070;Thus, it is essential that one nurtures and cares for their source of income, because that source brings home the bread, pays for the roof, and puts clothes on the back.
I:12166;1071;Ron Howard captures these sad moments of destitution in his boxing film Cinderella Man where the main character, Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe), finds himself loosing a life of comfort during the Great Depression.
I:12166;1072;the newspaper photo of a man getting his face bashed in by the ruthless glove of Jim Braddock opens the film, as it smoothly transitions into real life.
I:12166;1073;People sought a fortune behind every corner to live life with happiness and joy.
I:12166;1074;Instead of displaying a historical montage of how people lost everything Ron Howard simply shoots an extraordinary panning shot of Jim and his wife's, Mae (Ren e Zellweger), nightstand.
I:12166;1075;despite the hardships Jim continues to breath, as if he had everything.
I:12166;1076;Jim learns several life lessons that eventually will come of use, as he gets a one.
I:12166;1077;time deal to box the number one contender for the title with one day's notice from his friend and old manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), who again provides a brilliant performance.
I:12166;1078;To everyone's amazement Jim comes out victorious from the fight, which leads to another fight and maybe another fight after that.
I:12166;1079;ron Howard's film shows the good side of a person, at times a little too good, but it is still convincing.
I:12166;1080;This is much due to the excellent performance by Russell Crowe who makes his second film with Howard since A Beautiful Mind (2001).
I:12166;1081;Crowe's character becomes the essence of bravery and perseverance, as he must overcome the odds of doing something most would consider impossible.
I:12166;1082;cinderella Man illustrates issues such as gender roles, perseverance, personal struggle, and self.
I:12166;1083;improvement among many other issues in a time of extreme difficulty.
I:12166;1084;Thus, it is still a great film, which should not be missed, as it offers a truly excellent cinematic experience.
I:12166;1085;"Set during the Great Depression, Cinderella Man offers a powerful, emotion provoking tale about the life of boxer James ""Jim"" J. Braddock."
I:12166;1086;in this sometimes sad, sometimes exciting tale, we are introduced to Braddock's and his family, including his wife and children, who, just before The Great Depression, are living a good life while Braddock pursues his career as a boxing champion.
I:12166;1087;He continues to struggle to find work on the docks as day laborer.
I:12166;1088;And here he makes a tremendous comeback, or gives a resounding good.
I:12166;1089;It would make an excellent date movie as it has something for the guys and gals.
I:12166;1090;an amazing biography/period piece that BOTH women and men will enjoy.
I:12166;1091;The story is simply awe.
I:12166;1092;inspiring and the acting is superb.
I:12166;1093;Not to mention the beautiful cinematography.
I:12166;1094;My mom lived during the Great Depression and she recommend this movie.
I:12166;1095;In her words it shows how it was.
I:12166;1096;It has historical value and it is a good movie!
I:12166;1097;Absolutely and unequivocally the best film of the year.
I:12166;1098;Excellent film for both genders (not just a guy movie nor not just a chick flick).
I:12166;1099;Great story on so many levels.
I:12166;1100;Crowe, Zellweger, and all do an excellent job.
I:12166;1101;It was good for the 2nd time.
I:12166;1102;I've seen it bdfore and it was good then as now
I:12166;1103;"add the the equation an incredibly inspiring story about a ""regular"" American guy, who understood the meaning of family, respect and the desire to keep ""milk"" on the table."

I:12166;1105;even a casual boxing fan knows the names of the 'big contenders', where they fought and how they faired.
I:12166;1106;there is a whole life story here, one that any of us can identify with at some point in our lives.

I:12166;1109;What sets this apart from other underdog boxing films is the endearing and passionate performance of Russell Crowe.
I:12166;1110;"russell Crowe is utterly convincing as Jim Braddock
I:12166;1111;The sentimentality never becomes maudlin, and we come to like and admire Jim for the love he has for his family and his determination to do whatever he has to do to support them.
I:12166;1112;These scenes show he was a man of intense pride and inner strength.
I:12166;1113;Cinderella Man is an inspiring movie!Kona
I:12166;1114;riches heavyweight world boxing champion of the mid.1930s is among Russell Crowe's finest work.
I:12166;1115;A real Horatio Alger story full of inspiration and good old fashioned values, CINDERELLA MAN is full of fine performances, especially those by Renee Zellweger (as Mae, Jim Braddock's Wife) and Paul Giamatti (as Jim's Manager/Trainer/Promoter/Friend Joe Gould).
I:12166;1116;Unable to box, Jim and his family have no choice but to face the full rigors of the Great Depression.
I:12166;1117;A proud man, Jim at first refuses to go on the dole, but circumstances force it.
I:12166;1118;director Ron Howard's phenomenal presentation of Depression Era life in a northeastern winter is poignant and troubling, especially in these awful economic times of 2010.
I:12166;1119;ranked boxer for a small fee, which Jim, shockingly, wins handily.
I:12166;1120;"jim begins a steady climb to the top again, becoming the hero of the ""little guy"" along the way."
I:12166;1121;except for this unfortunate bit of misreportage which costs it points, CINDERELLA MAN is a pleasure to watch.
I:12166;1122;A paean to hope, love and family, it is a film in the good old fashioned vein, a story of adversities overcome and dreams realized, a film that restores its audience.
I:12166;1123;Russell Crowe is powerful as Jim Braddock.
I:12166;1124;Renee Zellweger is excellent as Mae Braddock.
I:12166;1125;Paul Giamatti (Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actor) is impressive as Joe Gould.
I:12166;1126;Ron Howard's directing is excellent.
I:12166;1127;The story by Cliff Hollingsworth and the screenplay by Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman is excellent.
I:12166;1128;The music by Thomas Newman is excellent.
I:12166;1129;The cinematography by Salvatore Totino is excellent.
I:12166;1130;The film editing (Oscar nominated) by Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill is excellent.
I:12166;1131;The production design by Wynn Thomas is excellent.
I:12166;1132;The art direction by Peter Grundy and Dan Yarhi is excellent.
I:12166;1133;The set decoration by Gordon Sim is excellent.
I:12166;1134;The costume design by Daniel Orlandi is excellent.
I:12166;1135;This is one of the year's best!
I:12166;1136;An impressive reunion for Ron Howard and Russell Crowe.
I:12166;1137;Also nominated for Best Make.
I:12166;1138;"That said, as soon as I saw the preview I knew ""Cinderella Man"" was a must."
I:12166;1139;"steps, ""Grinch"" and ""The Missing"" Ron Howard returns to top form."
I:12166;1140;"Best of all ""Cinderella Man"" has a beating heart of optimism beneath that melancholy."
I:12166;1141;And that is why Ron Howard was the perffect choice for director, he has an incredible gift for honestly, and exuberantly retelling American history.
I:12166;1142;He will have you cheering for him and his family throughout.
I:12166;1143;There are no surprises, but the story is true, the sacrifice and triumph is very real, and the ending is heartwarming.
I:12166;1144;I'd recommend it to any Russell Crowe fan.
I:12166;1145;I'm a huge fan, and quite frankly if he wasn't in the lead, I'm not sure I'd have such a positive reaction.
I:12166;1146;"He is pound for pound probably the best director Hollywood has, and ""Cinderella Man"", for all its conventions and standard approaches, is easily among Mr. Howard's most entertaining works yet."
I:12166;1147;"and ""Cinderella Man"" should really be so easy to dislike."
I:12166;1148;The figure is a cinematic one no matter how based in `reality' the story may be, and the film uses all the tricks of the cinema to bring this character to life.
I:12166;1149;Double check here, with the fine tale of James B. Braddock who fights his way up from the poverty of the depression and becomes an inspiration to all his other hard.
I:12166;1150;The politics may be oversimplified, and even a bit sensationalized to heighten the film's `inspirational' value, but once again this kind of old.
I:12166;1151;fashioned manipulation fits in here, and is handled with enough tact and genuine heart to overstep the pitfalls.
I:12166;1152;another thing a great entertainment movie needs is good acting.
I:12166;1153;Russell Crowe is as personable and enjoyable to watch as ever, and has a certain old.
I:12166;1154;The part may not be the most challenging, but it still takes a certain amount of charisma and talent to pull it off, and Crowe more than delivers here.
I:12166;1155;I generally loath the term `edge of you seat' but must admit that for all my attempts to be a cool headed, critical viewer I was definitely on the edge of mine for the final bout.
I:12166;1156;"It may be formulaic, it may be slick and shallow, but surely something must still be able to be said for a movie as entertaining and finely crafted as ""Cinderella Man""."
I:12166;1157;I just thought this was a great movie.
I:12166;1158;"I have the TV on with the Morning News show and the cerebral guy and the terminally cute ""colleague."""
I:12166;1159;And likewise I would say that Ron Howard creates a perfect movie for the dignity of humans, the depression, the love of family, the promises made to children, second chances, self respect and loyalty.
I:12166;1160;I mean three brilliant actors, a complicated topic (whatever country is he talking about, dude?)
I:12166;1161;, and a boxxing movie.
I:12166;1162;See it a second time.
I:12166;1163;I was surprised that this film seemed to live up to its billing, in part due to Crowe's restrained but still one dimensional performance.
I:12166;1164;no one should confuse Crowe with the great actors of his or any other era.
I:12166;1165;Still, he ensures box office and that's why he was cast here.
I:12166;1166;Renee Zelwegger, Hollywood's best actress (can't say the same for her personal life decision.
I:12166;1167;Both these actors did well filling in the gaps around Crowe's touchy feely boxer.
I:12166;1168;still, this is a pretty good flick about a guy that really existed in scenes and frames that will have you cheering for him and his family inside and outside the ring.
I:12166;1169;I love the character of the characters, especially Jim.
I:12166;1170;This is what a real man looks like!
I:12166;1171;and I call it that because it's more than just a movie, it is a truly artful work, with a masterful performance by the hugely talented Russell Crowe .
I:12166;1172;but what is unassailable is the authenticity and vitality of a truly tour de force performance by Russell Crowe as Jimmy Braddock, a man who took life's hard left hooks .
I:12166;1173;and pulled from the depths of his soul the strength to hang on to what he knew was precious, important, and real.
I:12166;1174;"cinderella Man is ""Rocky"" without the smarm
I:12166;1175;"Crowe is our modern Brando
I:12166;1176;Great acting is like a magic trick .
I:12166;1177;The man keeps turning in these performances, each one topping the last, blazing a trail that many a lesser actor could scarcely imagine folowing.
I:12166;1178;renee Zellwegger is solid in her role as Jimmy's wife Mae.
I:12166;1179;This is a straightforward and welcome performance from Zellwegger, who can play quixotic or serious equally well but doesn't get the latter parts often enough.
I:12166;1180;Though not handsome in any traditional sense of the word, Giamatti is gaining a real following for his talents as a character actor.
I:12166;1181;He'll doubtless be in more movies .
I:12166;1182;bottom line: Cinderella Man is simply a triumph of modern day American cinema.
I:12166;1183;Ladies and gentlemen, stand up and cheer!
I:12166;1184;Did you really think Seabiscuit was going to lose to War Admiral?Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a successful light.
I:12166;1185;That is where the Cinderella part of the story comes into play, ending up with a title fight with the heavyweight champion, Max Baer (Craig Bierko).
I:12166;1186;"fortunately ""Cinderella Man"" saves most of its best moments for when Braddock is in the ring."
I:12166;1187;Instead it is about Howard going up against Martin Scorcese in terms of the boxing sequences, and while I could talk about specific cinematic elements (e. g., use of flashbulbs and flashbulb effects), what I thought was most impressive was the sense of the strategic ebb and flow of the fights.
I:12166;1188;We always have a sense for what is happening in each fight, and there are bonus points for Thomas Newman's understated scoring of the fights.
I:12166;1189;If you like boxing stories, this one is a must.
I:12166;1190;It shows the best of the human spirit when faced with adversity.
I:12166;1191;But most of all, the story is great.
I:12166;1192;We first see him as a family man, rushing home after a big win with money in his pocket to his loving wife and family.
I:12166;1193;paul Giamatti, who plays his fight manager, manages to get Jim one more fight.
I:12166;1194;The rest, as they say, is history.
I:12166;1195;in addition to the story, the film really captures the depression era of the 1930s.
I:12166;1196;We feel this by the skillful crafting of many little human dramas.
I:12166;1197;It is very real, with the one exception of Ms. Zellweger's wardrobe.
I:12166;1198;to sum up, in spite of its minor shortcomings, this film is wonderful.
I:12166;1199;We all need an inspiring story right now.
I:12166;1200;Russell Crowe plays Jim Braddock as a man to admire and emulate.
I:12166;1201;just a good teaching movie of heart and honesty and teaching kids thru hardship and learning to love each other thru struggles
I:12166;1202;I even made my dad watch it, and that is saying a lot!
I:12166;1203;Russell Crowe is really good in this movie.
I:12166;1204;He finally gets a second chance.
I:12166;1205;Such a great movie, it's really a good movie to watch when your in the mud yourself, it helps brings new life and purpose back into our occasionally miserable existence.
I:12166;1206;I teach high school history, and this film is a great one for showing what life was like during the Depression, but with enough action to keep the kids really interested.
I:12166;1207;Great film, well acted and (as best as I can tell) fairly accurate, with the exception of how Max Baer was shown.
I:12166;1208;Despite of all the negative press Russell Crowe seem to get off screen, there is no denying that he is one of Hollywood's superb actors.
I:12166;1209;Once more in the movie Cinderella Man, Crowe proves that not only can he act superbly but also bring out the essence of his character to light in an unbelievable way.
I:12166;1210;(Cliches worked well in Mel Gibson's When We Were Soldiers.
I:12166;1211;and it worked well in this movie.)
I:12166;1212;The movie is well scripted, well directed and superbly acted.
I:12166;1213;despite of that, the movie still work well and you can't help but get involved into the film even if the informative individuals like myself already knows the outcome of the story.
I:12166;1214;I like Russell Crowe the actor and he has had many wonderful performances.
I:12166;1215;I think this is one of his best roles.
I:12166;1216;this movie was recommended to me by a male friend of mine.
I:12166;1217;it was brilliantly done and acted.
I:12166;1218;It was a thoroughly enjoyable, well.
I:12166;1219;"Of course, Howard was able to attract perhaps three of the best of the best to star in the film, and Americans, fresh on the heels of TV's ""The Contender"" and Eastwood's masterpiece, ""Million Dollar Baby"", seem eager to see ""the sport of kings"" on the screen."
I:12166;1220;"howard is honest with his camera work
I:12166;1221;he and writer Akiva Gold give us surprising little of early Braddock success.
I:12166;1222;Instead, Howard plunges us from ringside success right into the crash that threw all of America on its heels .
I:12166;1223;moving quickly into this tone, Howard makes us believe in his characters.
I:12166;1224;"Having worked with Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"", Howard wisely lets the actor call his own shots."
I:12166;1225;Both the scenes in which Braddock has to seek Public Assistance and the one in which he goes to a Manhattan boxing club to beg for money to feed his family show Crowe at his best .
I:12166;1226;And, during his comeback, Crowe stays true to that picture.
I:12166;1227;"Crowe plays Braddock equally well as a boxer and a man
I:12166;1228;The best of Crowe comes out, however, as a friend and commodity to sassy trainer/promoter Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti).
I:12166;1229;renee Zellweger gets to roll out some of what made her so successful as Roxie in Chicago.
I:12166;1230;Her odd beauty fits with the costumes and hairstyles of the day.
I:12166;1231;She's torn between supporting her husband, a world.
I:12166;1232;Perhaps Giamatti's finest moments are when he takes on Baer in a bout of words only while the champ fights Braddock in the ring.
I:12166;1233;Crowe plays strong when surrounded by strong support, and Howard truly cast Giamatti well in this film.
I:12166;1234;His ability to bring this version of Baer to life should reawaken interest in the short.
I:12166;1235;He is savage in the ring and loves his night life and swagger.
I:12166;1236;Bierko is highly believable and larger than life.
I:12166;1237;"two cinematic ""moments"" are worth mentioning ."
I:12166;1238;And Zellweger gets her chance to be reflective, as well.
I:12166;1239;He's made an outstanding movie, skirting the shadows for what Americans love best, honor and honesty.
I:12166;1240;The filming is safe and straightforward, and yes, entertaining.
I:12166;1241;Still, and all, a great effort for all concerned, right down to the music.
I:12166;1242;by all means, go see it in theaters, it will leave you smiling.
I:12166;1243;This would well be the best picture of the year and not so much because of Ron Howard's directing (who gave us the overhyped and underwhelming 'A Beautiful Mind') In my opinion, Ron Howard is marginally and this is a generous comment, better than Brett Ratner (Another unimaginative Director, I shudder at the thought of Mr. Ratner directing Xmen3!)
I:12166;1244;But the two male actors are just astounding!
I:12166;1245;At the start of the film, we see James Braddock's children(bet 4 and 6years old ) were at an age when 2 .
I:12166;1246;3 years would have brought about tremendous physical change, let alone 9 years!
I:12166;1247;Acting was good and feeling were convincing.
I:12166;1248;I wish I seen it on the big screen.
I:12166;1249;Great to see the insight on this man's life and how he dealt with the complex issues surrounding his inspiring story.
I:12166;1250;Usually he movies we watch are pretty boring, but I was surprised that I liked Cinderella Man.
I:12166;1251;It's a very good story and the boxing is good too.
I:12166;1252;There might be some unpleasant parts, but it's a good movie.
I:12166;1253;Cinderella Man is a great true story about James Braddock, a washed.
I:12166;1254;up boxer who manages to become champion and an inspiration to Depression.
I:12166;1255;This is a heart warming movie& I loved every minute of it.
I:12166;1256;Rene and Russell were great.
I:12166;1257;It is a great movie for the whole family
I:12166;1258;Another great movie by the amazing and one of my favorites Russell Crowe!
I:12166;1259;One of the best movies I've watched lately and it seems so real and very inspiring dramatic movie.
I:12166;1260;loved it then and even more the second time!!
I:12166;1261;Both films feature charismatic managers who believe in their fighters and make sacrifices to give them a chance .
I:12166;1262;the one that earned the Oscar and the hearts of movie.
I:12166;1263;"James J. Braddock comes to living, breathing life in Mr. Crowe's performance, and Ron Howard was wise (as he so often is) choosing to pair himself once again with his ""Beautiful Mind"" star."
I:12166;1264;Braddock earns thousands of dollars in an early bout .
I:12166;1265;Later, Braddock returns to that office to stand in line, and what he does there demonstrates part of why James J. Braddock became a folk hero to the people of the depression.
I:12166;1266;Howard, Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti make the trip enjoyable nonetheless.
I:12166;1267;Boxing matches tend to be long and drawn out, there's a lot of back and forth, and it's a lot of intensity all the time.
I:12166;1268;There is also the issue of scoring.
I:12166;1269;In many sports, scoring makes sense.
I:12166;1270;This movie is an adaptation of the life of James Braddock, a depression era boxer who went from a washed up fighter who had to go on public assistance to world champion.
I:12166;1271;We get to see the effects of the depression straight up, in a very accurate way.
I:12166;1272;this movie also accomplishes something else that is very hard to do, and that is to keep the interest of an audience that already knows the plot.
I:12166;1273;ron Howard does a superb job directing this movie, and gets great performances out of everyone in the cast.
I:12166;1274;Russell Crowe is surprisingly good.
I:12166;1275;There are plenty of other great performances, including my favorite performance in the entire film, Chuck Shamata playing Father Rorick, the Braddock family priest and former sparring partner of Braddock's.
I:12166;1276;The scenes involving Shamata, who is an award winning actor in Canada, never fail to provide some comedic relief during some of the most intense fighting scenes in the movie.
I:12166;1277;This helps the viewer not overdose of brute violence.
I:12166;1278;The boxing scenes in this movie are believable and impressive.
I:12166;1279;The cinematography is excellent, and this film looks good.
I:12166;1280;definitely see this film, it is not just for boxing enthusiasts.
I:12166;1281;It also gave a good idea of what life was like during the great depression.
I:12166;1282;Money's flowing, he's winning, and his family loves him.
I:12166;1283;Thinking this is just a final fight for him, Braddock accepts the fight because the money is so good.
I:12166;1284;And he ends up winning the fight!
I:12166;1285;way trip to the top in a match against the heavy.
I:12166;1286;But, incidentally, the swearing added to the humor of the scene.
I:12166;1287;This is a good movie, but certainly not a great one.
I:12166;1288;(And I have enjoyed watching Walt Disney's Cinderella more than that, and Dumbo too.)
I:12166;1289;This is not even remotely in the same league with Shindlers List, One Eyed Jacks, The Sting, most Buster Keaton movies, Rebecca, Sound of Music, The Easy Life, [Don't] Shoot the Piano Player, etc etc,.
I:12166;1290;It beats Rocky for instance, and that got an Oscar.
I:12166;1291;If the great depression of the 1930s is a dark, unexplored part of ancient history for you, then Cinderella Man will do you a world of good.
I:12166;1292;The story, about the ups and downs in the career of a boxer, is well.
I:12166;1293;I have observed in people I have known over the years who lived through the depression.
I:12166;1294;Start at the top with director Ron Howard and male lead Russell Crowe.
I:12166;1295;for the Academy Award for best director and the Academy Award for best picture .
I:12166;1296;A Beautiful Mind, which also starred Crowe.
I:12166;1297;He also studied the footage of Braddock to master the real fighter's characteristic gestures.
I:12166;1298;In the ring, said one of Crowe's trainers, he successfully duplicated Braddock's moves, his footwork, and his style.
I:12166;1299;the boxing moves the story along, and it is bloody, and fierce.
I:12166;1300;In the scenes with the high.
I:12166;1301;spirited than Baer actually was.
I:12166;1302;this is a very entertaining film.
I:12166;1303;"I think it is important young people see this movie (and Saving Pvt. Ryan )to understand what made the ""Greatest Generation "" great ."
I:12166;1304;Hollywood at it's best ,instead of glorifying social deviates and weirdos .
I:12166;1305;It's a shame that this movie didn't do better at the box office, as it's one of the best movies I've seen this year.
I:12166;1306;The trick with a movie like this is to overcome two built.
I:12166;1307;good movies where the underdog wins the day.
I:12166;1308;The fact that the story of James Braddock is true makes the achievement even more amazing.
I:12166;1309;Although the tale of Braddock's comeback is little known, it truly is one of the best human interest stories in all of sports history.
I:12166;1310;And Crowe (offscreen phone tossing habits aside) is truly one of the greatest actors working today, and one that I love to watch, especially in a role like this.
I:12166;1311;James Braddock has always been one of my favorite stories in the history of boxing.
I:12166;1312;His story, known to all now, would certainly make a great movie.
I:12166;1313;In reality, Max Baer was a gentle man who was nearly cursed with a sledgehammer punch and powerful physique.
I:12166;1314;He began smoking again, a habit he had licked to stay in shape.
I:12166;1315;I think the movie was excellent and very inspirational.
I:12166;1316;This is one of my favorite boxing movies.
I:12166;1317;It is also a great movie in that the leading people remain with one another no matter the struggles.
I:12166;1318;Anyway, the features are ok and give some insight to the roles.
I:12166;1319;I absolutely love this film.
I:12166;1320;RUSSELL CROWE and PAUL GIAMMATTI are great in this Film.
I:12166;1321;A great, inspiring True Story !
I:12166;1322;"up"" (1949 film noir: see my review), with Robert Ryan."
I:12166;1323;I find it, inspirational, he said.
I:12166;1324;I was very impressed with the entire movie: cinematography, screen play, musical score, character actors.
I:12166;1325;"I have been an admirer of Ren e Zellweger ever since I saw her in ""The Whole Wide World"", and she is perfect in this role as Bradock's utterly loyal wife."
I:12166;1326;I thoroughly enjoyed this story about a noble underdog from New Jersey who re.
I:12166;1327;establishes his reign in the world of boxing after succumbing to the woes of the Great Depression.
I:12166;1328;Russell Crowe always does well in strong character roles with a physical component and this is no exception.
I:12166;1329;It took a bit for me to warm up to Ren e Zellweger in the role of Mae, James Braddock's (the Cinderella Man) wife but she was really brilliant and brought me to tears numerous times.
I:12166;1330;The fighting scenes were intense and wonderfully shot.
I:12166;1331;I was very excited to receive this movie.
I:12166;1332;It's a wonderful movie with a great story and I was very pleased to receive my order!
I:12166;1333;"Populist film director, Ron Howard is always efficient and ""Apollo 13"" is arguably his best film to date."
I:12166;1334;"All of Howard's films look great
I:12166;1335;"i. e., ""A Beautiful Mind."
I:12166;1336;russell Crowe plays Braddock very smartly: his Braddock is a simple man who loves his wife (a wasted Renee Zelwegger in a thankless role) and children and will do anything to make sure that their meager needs are met.
I:12166;1337;This scene is persuasively staged and Crowe is so touching and sad yet courageous that it brings tears to your eyes.
I:12166;1338;Crowe has never been better: he brings palpable integrity to this role that cannot be faked.
I:12166;1339;as Joe Gould, Braddock's boxing coach and manager, Paul Giamatti is also brilliant.
I:12166;1340;"Giamatti, free of all the smarminess and whine of ""Sideways,"" just about walks away with this picture."
I:12166;1341;And their absolute silence as he enters the arena for that bout is thrilling proof of their love, devotion and reverence for Braddock, for they sense that this may be the last time they see him enter the ring.
I:12166;1342;This movie does such a good job depicting New York City during the Depression that I literally felt transported back in time.
I:12166;1343;The acting is great and the fight scenes are the most realistic that I have ever seen in a boxing movie (including Raging Bull).
I:12166;1344;There are many heartwarming scenes especially when Rene Zellweger (Jim's wife) is helpless to take care of her child who appears to be sick with pneumonia.
I:12166;1345;A great movie showing the ups and downs, struggles, and triumphs not only in the ring but with family and the hardships of the period.
I:12166;1346;"Great cast and story
I:12166;1347;"A ""one of a kind"" movie, with incredible heart."
I:12166;1348;This movie stands on its own and is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and have seen many.
I:12166;1349;This movie makes one feel good and renews one's belief in a person, family, and nation.
I:12166;1350;"Remember, ""It's a Beautiful Life,"" it won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Actor."
I:12166;1351;Certainly Richard is a very complex individual and one of the world's best thespians.
I:12166;1352;for those that have an opportunity to still see this spectacular movie on the silver screen, run!!
I:12166;1353;"I got about half way through this movie and I was thinking, ""is this a really fantastic movie or is it just me?"""
I:12166;1354;"Right at that moment, my wife looked at me and said, ""is this movie really great or is it just me?"""
I:12166;1355;It is an excellent story and the acting is spectacular all the way around.
I:12166;1356;Not only is this movie most entertaining and well done but it offers us a glimpse of a world before out time.
I:12166;1357;It also is one of those rare movies that gives us a lesson ( message )without offending.
I:12166;1358;CINDERELLA MAN is a rousing, inspirational, true story of Irish Jimmy Braddock, boxer and dock worker.
I:12166;1359;good aspect about it that SEABISCUIT does.
I:12166;1360;CINDERELLA MAN, on the other hand, extolls such values as family, hard work and reluctance to take a handout from the government.
I:12166;1361;Maybe this message was not negative enough for Oscar voters but it gets my vote as best picture of the year.
I:12166;1362;key performances of folks trying to manage in hard times, but Paul Giamatti (SIDEWAYS) steals the show as Braddock's fight agent and he deserved Best Supporting Actor for his work in this film.
I:12166;1363;CINDERELLA MAN is a good family picture with a good family message and .
I:12166;1364;He is expected to get pummelled, but surprises the crowd and himself with a victory.
I:12166;1365;Cinderella Man is based on the true life story of Braddock, and is more than just a boxing movie.
I:12166;1366;I found the treatment of the Great Depression to be absolutely fascinating.
I:12166;1367;Director Ron Howard gives a very real feeling of what that era was like.
I:12166;1368;Crowe and Giamatti shine in their respective roles, and the boxing scenes are top notch.
I:12166;1369;This is a very good film that will be remembered come Oscar time.
I:12166;1370;The way in which John Kerry and the rest of the DNC were selling the idea to the American public you would have thought the nation was in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, in spite of the numerous European nations, the favored sons of the left, willing to do anything for an unemployment rate like we have.
I:12166;1371;the story for Cinderella Man, based on the actual life events of lightweight boxing contender James J. Braddock in the midst of the Great Depression, may be tough for some people to swallow at first.
I:12166;1372;True, there are quite a few notable moments of sheer clich but this is an Oscar.
I:12166;1373;And yes, the portrayal of James Braddock, confined not merely to Crowe's engaging performance but his words and actions as dictated from the screenplay as well, reflects an almost saint.
I:12166;1374;the commanding performance delivered by a rather toned.
I:12166;1375;Though Crowe is likely to be remembered in cinematic history more for his fierce and combative role in Gladiator, more pastoral and emotionally charged performances in films like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man, both with Ron Howard directing, will earn further respect, not only among his Hollywood peers but amidst the discerning public as well.
I:12166;1376;Ren e Zellweger, whose star in Hollywood has truly been rising since her breakout performance opposite Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire with Academy Award nominated roles in the hit musical Chicago and Cold Mountain, carries the emotional baggage of the film with prodigious flare.
I:12166;1377;paul Giamatti yet again, which in this case is far from what one would describe as a terrible thing occurring, brings a level of extraordinary brilliance to the role of Joe Gould, James Braddock's long time manager and friend, which is astonishing.
I:12166;1378;He exhibits the splendid balance of levity and endearment that audiences would come to expect from a person as close to Braddock as Joe Gould was in real life.
I:12166;1379;Craig Bierko, a rising performer who has had few lead acting support roles such as this one, brings just the right amount of emotional intensity and loathsome anxiety to the role of Max Baer, James Braddock's opponent in the championship fight.
I:12166;1380;This allows audiences to detest Baer for his spiteful behavior but at the same time admire and fear his strength.
I:12166;1381;two deliverance of an emotionally gripping true story of Depression.
I:12166;1382;era boxer James J. Braddock and Russell Crowe's competently driven performance unanimously makes Cinderella Man the single most impressive feat this year.
I:12166;1383;Cinderella Man portrays a simple yet meaningful message of hard.
I:12166;1384;work, optimism, and the American spirit without having to force it down the throats of audience members.
I:12166;1385;"That makes Howard the perfect director for ""Cinderella Man,"" a film about a guy who succeeds in life mainly because of his honesty and determination."
I:12166;1386;braddock's comeback happens largely due to the efforts of his manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), whose cocky, ebullient personality complements Braddock's natural strength perfectly.
I:12166;1387;the relationship between Braddock and Gould is the heart of the film, and both Crowe and Giamatti shine.
I:12166;1388;Zellweger has some nice scenes as Braddock's wife, who fears that her husband will be killed in the ring, but curiously, her role is almost secondary to Gould's.
I:12166;1389;Not really, and in this sense, the understated direction fits the story perfectly.
I:12166;1390;"but ""Cinderella Man"" is a solid, exceptionally likeable film nonetheless."
I:12166;1391;This is all time one of my favorite movies.
I:12166;1392;I like this a lot.
I:12166;1393;also based on a true story.
I:12166;1394;This film is struggling at the box office, and with one good reason .
I:12166;1395;We watched in conjunction with our study of the Great Depression, and it made the challenges in this area faced by the people during this time come alive.
I:12166;1396;russell Crowe is a superb character actor who also has great presence, so he's perfect to play a star athlete.
I:12166;1397;James Braddock was a modest and unassuming man, and this is a nice understated performance by Crowe.
I:12166;1398;And boxing fans will enjoy the fight scenes, which often place the camera in the ring.
I:12166;1399;To reflect the demoralized American psyche of the Great Depression, the backdrop against which this story is told, the cinematography is on the dark side.
I:12166;1400;key lighting with color film.
I:12166;1401;Really nice work by cinematographer Salvatore Totino.
I:12166;1402;Cinderella Man is a finely crafted biopic that successfully conveys the anguish of Braddock's hardships, his gratitude at getting a second chance, and the joy so many fans felt at his triumph, which makes it a successful sports film as well.
I:12166;1403;Sometimes I come away from Director Ron Howard's films feeling that he is very good at some things, but depth of emotion isn't one of them.
I:12166;1404;It showed how a man's pride often breaks a wife's heart.
I:12166;1405;Cinderella Man was one of the best movies of 2006.
I:12166;1406;i found the simple honesty of the film to be its greatest virtue.
I:12166;1407;Crowe turned in another brilliant performance, making me believe I was actually watching James Braddock instead of Crowe playing the boxing great.
I:12166;1408;Paul Giamatti was equally brilliant as his trainer.
I:12166;1409;This is a superb film that is clean enough for all but small children to enjoy.
I:12166;1410;In spite of these comparisons, this movie is something special.
I:12166;1411;Ron Howard does a great job of drawing the viewer into the Braddock family's plight.
I:12166;1412;The boxing scenes are exciting and the overall story is fantastic, especially because it is true.
I:12166;1413;the story makes for a good movie by itself, but the movie is great due to the contributions of the actors, primarily Russell Crowe.
I:12166;1414;He manages to play a humble man who is nonetheless able to punch out just about anyone in America, and do so convincingly.
I:12166;1415;He has a lot of charisma, which attracts the audience to him from the beginning.
I:12166;1416;this has to be one of the top 5 films of 2005.
I:12166;1417;I dislike boxing, but I love true stories and this is a great movie to watch.
I:12166;1418;I think this is a good movie for a man and woman to come to ageement to watch on a saturday night.
I:12166;1419;This is not just a chick flick, my husband said it was the best movie he had seen in a long time, and so do I. It's an awesome movie with a lot of fighting and a lot of heart.
I:12166;1420;giamatti are the obvious nominations) and it deserves it.
I:12166;1421;Ron Howard is at the top of his game here, properly balancing the depression/family scenes and long grueling bouts in the ring.
I:12166;1422;I would even say that this is my favorite film of his.
I:12166;1423;Russell Crowe turns in another great performance (when does he not?)
I:12166;1424;and has earned the spot as one our most gifted actors along side Johnny Depp.
I:12166;1425;On par with Crowe in the performance department is the wonderful Paul Giamatti.
I:12166;1426;He plays the manager of Jim Braddock (Crowe) and the relationship between the two is so believable, not to mention he adds the right amount of comic relief.
I:12166;1427;Renee Zellweger is someone who I am usaully not fond of, but she manages pretty good here.
I:12166;1428;She is the weakest performance by far, but fits into the movie nicely.
I:12166;1429;If you don't like boxing, you will still love the drama Cinderella Man has to offer.
I:12166;1430;Finally, it is nice to see a prize fighter depicted as the nice guy Braddock was.
I:12166;1431;Excellent movie with many good life lessons.
I:12166;1432;I have watched the movie many times and I enjoy it each time.
I:12166;1433;This is by far the best movie of the year for me.
I:12166;1434;It's very rare when that happens in a movie.
I:12166;1435;Renee is very sympathetic and sweet in the movie.
I:12166;1436;But the best part of the movie is Paul Giamatti.
I:12166;1437;He MUST get an Oscar this year.
I:12166;1438;He was sensational in Sideways, but was overlooked by the Academy.
I:12166;1439;The story was really good too.
I:12166;1440;The boxing scenes were very gripping and intense.
I:12166;1441;Some of the punches were like right in my face and I loved it.
I:12166;1442;so overall, this is the one to see this summer!
I:12166;1443;I thought Million Dollar Baby was the most powerful movie I've seen recently, but Cinderella Man was just as (if not more) powerful than it.
I:12166;1444;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and it's Ron Howards masterpiece, to date!All I can say is, I hope Ron makes another GREAT film like this .
I:12166;1445;russell Crowe, Renee Zulweger, are some of the best in American films!See more of Renees' finest in 'Cold Mountain.'
I:12166;1446;And of course, see 'Gladiator' for Russell's best.
I:12166;1447;Russell Crowe is great in this inspirational true story.
I:12166;1448;A great depiction of the Great Depression and one mans true life struggle and way to survive the dirty 30's
I:12166;1449;All in all it's still a wonderful film.
I:12166;1450;Heartfelt, inspirational and an eternal classic!
I:12166;1451;Paul Giamatti gives a fantastic(should have won an Oscar!)
I:12166;1452;This is one of Ron Howards best films, if not the best picture he has ever made.
I:12166;1453;one of the best pictures I have seen in many years!
I:12166;1454;The power of Jim Braddock's comeback during the Great Depression is its simplicity and its metaphor for the country at that time.
I:12166;1455;and this is what REALLY carries this film along.
I:12166;1456;Russell Crowe is almost obscenely good in this as a simple man who quite simply finds his purpose in life, and this makes all the difference.
I:12166;1457;Renee Zellweger is wonderful as Braddock's wife, and of course don't forget the common man's gift to movies, Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manager.
I:12166;1458;What impressed me about this movie was the portrayal of the Great Depression.
I:12166;1459;My mother was about the age of the Braddock's daughter in 1933, so I was able to really relate to the story.
I:12166;1460;The people who say the first part of the movie was slow should take another look.
I:12166;1461;Also, I think it is interesting to see his life in contrast to modern celebrities and professional athletes.
I:12166;1462;As a fan of Russell's for over 7 years now I was looking forward to this film.
I:12166;1463;A great job done by him and Ron Howard.
I:12166;1464;While the story of one of boxing' greatest comebacks is engaging, what is truly compelling is the love story between a man and his wife, and his total dedication to keeping his struggling family together.
I:12166;1465;Renee Zellweger does an amazing job in her portrayal of a woman torn between supporting her husband and protecting her herself and her children from the dangers he faces.
I:12166;1466;great family flick, and even the chicks in my extended family loved this movie.
I:12166;1467;"We really enjoyed it, i love ""underdog movies""."
I:12166;1468;this movie had the right touch of sweetness and class.
I:12166;1469;had a tear in my eyes a couple of times during this film.
I:12166;1470;And the boxing scenes are awesome.
I:12166;1471;we love russel crowe and this movie was so excellent.
I:12166;1472;The whole family really loved watching it, so happy we bought it.
I:12166;1473;Gave me a true appreciationFor those who lived during the depression.
I:12166;1474;portrayal from cast was outstandingMy favorite movie
I:12166;1475;This movie brought me to tears a few times.
I:12166;1476;Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time!
I:12166;1477;The lead roles gave sterling performances (Russell Crowe and Renee Zelwegger).
I:12166;1478;Another thing that's really great about it is that it is based on a true.
I:12166;1479;The boxing scenes are great and realistic.
I:12166;1480;one theme rings clear all throughout the movie .
I:12166;1481;Set in the midst of the U. s. Great Depression in the 1930's, this film offers so much hope for those who are downtrodden.
I:12166;1482;The trust and support of one's wife is a must if a man is to win in life.4.
I:12166;1483;At the end of the day, it is your most important relationships that will come through for you.
I:12166;1484;Although previously unfamiliar with Braddock's story and not a boxing fan, I was greatly moved by this wonderful drama.
I:12166;1485;Russell Crowe plays Jim Braddocok with such heartfelt integrity that it is impossible not to be swept up in his story and you will root for him from start to finish.
I:12166;1486;giamatti and Zellweger both turn in earnest supporting performances but still pale alongside the great Crowe.
I:12166;1487;During the Great Depression years later, thanks to his former manager, he has an opportunity to make an amazing comeback.
I:12166;1488;Paul Giamatti was wonderful in this.
I:12166;1489;He has a knack for embodying varied characters that continues to impress me.
I:12166;1490;As odd as that sounds, it is very true of his performance in this film.
I:12166;1491;Renee Zellweger is good in this, too, making the three primary performers all really strong.
I:12166;1492;The fight scenes weren't too gory, and the ultimately uplifting message of the film made it a feel.
I:12166;1493;I like Ron Howard's movies, I do.
I:12166;1494;The one who stood out above the rest was Paul Giamatti who, IMHO, has blindsided the world in the past two years with his acting chops and range.
I:12166;1495;I think there is a danger in creating perfect characters.
I:12166;1496;Hollywood uses their artistic freedom card frequently.
I:12166;1497;very nicely done movie, good script, good acting, good directing, it's about 10 times better than the boring million dollar baby.
I:12166;1498;except the shanty town scene that should me deleted, all the other parts are very good.
I:12166;1499;Very emotinal, exciting, and action packed.
I:12166;1500;Has the right mix for everyone, if you can tolerate the grafic boxing sceans
I:12166;1501;I hate to watch boxing, but this movie made it magical.
I:12166;1502;Superb acting, great characters, funny lines, and good lessons made it a worthwhile watch.
I:12166;1503;"Otherwise, I'll be watching ""Cinderella Man"" again."
I:12166;1504;it is a has a good ending.
I:12166;1505;the family enjoyed the acion.
I:12166;1506;Is on good time And i like the order ,,i'm so happy i will use the Service for sure next tim is verry good
I:12166;1507;As usual Amazon delivered this great film with out a flaw.
I:12166;1508;This movie based on a true story is an excellent watch for the whole family.
I:12166;1509;Please, some audience members are not stupid, but most are, and they will praise this unworthy film, along with others, as the splendid creation of an artist touched by his evocation of the past which he has created.
I:12166;1510;It may not be a classic like The Godfather , but it is such a great story, plus the director was able to make a terrible actress (Renee Zellweger who usually performs at very low levels that make you hate the movie she appears on) to finally perform at a level that is extremely high (for her average jobs) and decent enough for us viewers to enjoy this true story as it should.
I:12166;1511;Acting by Paul Giamatti, Crowe, and Zellwegger are perfect.
I:12166;1512;This is the sort of move that would make you a great person if you watched it once a week.
I:12166;1513;Howard really looked into the life of Jim Braddock, talked to his family, and he and Crow captured him well.
I:12166;1514;A courageous remarkable man, and his story was expertly and entertainingly told.
I:12166;1515;Braddock is also courageously portrayed as fighting when injured often.
I:12166;1516;The movie was over shadowed by Crowe's antics but Crowe, Giamatti, Zellweger and the rest of the cast give a great performance.
I:12166;1517;This movie will stay with you from opening to end.
I:12166;1518;I was on the edge of my seat in the theater.
I:12166;1519;The story, color, direction, music, etc. was superb.
I:12166;1520;This should have won multiple Oscars.
I:12166;1521;Ron Howard directed a truly extrordinary film and I hope he knows it.
I:12166;1522;The best boxing movie in my opinion.
I:12166;1523;It touches on family and the struggle to survive in a time when income was scarce.
I:12166;1524;Howard meshes the two storylines brilliantly and to an amazing finish.
I:12166;1525;turn out the lights, sit with the family and be moved.
I:12166;1526;Cinderella Man is the true rags to riches story of the Boxer 'Jim Braddock', wonderfully protrayed by a charismatic Russel Crowe.
I:12166;1527;Renee Zellweger and Paul Gammati, both turn in beautifully acted supporting roles.
I:12166;1528;This is a film of survival, endurance and elation, with a big dollop of good old.
I:12166;1529;Sit back, take out the popcorn and enjoy.
I:12166;1530;He's always got a lot of period detail, right ma?Yep, he sure does.
I:12166;1531;But since it is a Ron Howard movie, it is displayed with all the nuance and subtlety of a dancing bear in a ballet costume, and as usual, this blatant obviousness pervades the rest of the film as well.
I:12166;1532;But every single one of them is as shiny and bright as a Christmas toy.
I:12166;1533;Boxers and their sport are looked upon with a kind of sympathetic condescension.
I:12166;1534;Boxing was as appealing a sport as basketball and football are today, and like today's basketball or football star, a prize.
I:12166;1535;The fight scenes are pretty good, about as realistic as possible for Hollywood.
I:12166;1536;There is a nice touch Howard uses when a boxer suffers a painful blow: the screen is momentarily filled with a bright light and goes out of focus for a second or two.
I:12166;1537;And what do you know, they can even be viewed today!How nice it would have been if someone involved in the making of this film would have actually watched one or two of them, and clued Mr. Howard in as to how out.
I:12166;1538;mill boxing career of the good.
I:12166;1539;wonderful acting, great feel good story and some really good boxing scenes.
I:12166;1540;this is one of my favorite flims ever and i can't recommend it enough.
I:12166;1541;the collector's edition is awesome, it's packed with tons of good stuff.
I:12166;1542;this movie gives you a small way he would love his woman.
I:12166;1543;CINDERELLA MAN is one of the most outstanding boxing movies ever produced by Hollywood.
I:12166;1544;plagued by brittle hands,Braddock still manages to win the heavyweight title from Max Baer on June 13,1935 in Long Island City,New York.
I:12166;1545;the win is considered a remarkable feat for Braddock since he has sufferred many defeats due mostly to persistent injuries in prior years.
I:12166;1546;the motion picture is fascinating for boxing fans as it dramatizes Braddock's bouts with Max Baer,Art Lasky,Corn Griffin,Abe Feldman and John Henry Lewis as well as Baer's fight against Primo Carnera for the championship in 1934.
I:12166;1547;the movie does not try to alter Braddock's history and Ron Howard deserves high praise for his direction.
I:12166;1548;russell Crowe is convincing as Braddock and Renee Zellweger does a magnificent job in her role as Braddock's resolute wife.
I:12166;1549;paul Giamatti won Best Supporting Actor Awards from both the Boston Society of Film Critics and the Broadcast Film Critics Association for his portrayal of Joe Gould, Braddock's manager.
I:12166;1550;The boxing in this movie is excellent: the bouts between Braddock and various adversaries have the feel of boxing as it looks in the footage of classic fights.
I:12166;1551;The drama of these fights also reminds us of what boxing has lost over the years.
I:12166;1552;the story is a straightforward folk hero tale.
I:12166;1553;and Crowe and Giamatti do a fine job.
I:12166;1554;There's not enough to think about for that length of time, and Ron Howard always tells you exactly how to feel every step of the way.
I:12166;1555;lots of commentary and some mildly interesting bonus features.
I:12166;1556;The most interesting historical character ended up as a one.
I:12166;1557;Seabiscuit, of course, is the same kind of story using race horses and is more successful as entertainment.
I:12166;1558;The Jersey accents are a little annoying, but the movie is very well made.
I:12166;1559;I liked this film a lot and was prepared to give it five stars.
I:12166;1560;It's the best way to see such a film cuz I didn't know how it was going to end!
I:12166;1561;it was only the acting of Russell Crowe that got me to finish it.
I:12166;1562;I think he is a remarkable actor.
I:12166;1563;He reminds me a lot of Richard Burton.
I:12166;1564;the stocky build and that wonderful deep voice.
I:12166;1565;His facial expressions in this film are something to behold.
I:12166;1566;Crowe underplays it which adds to the impact.
I:12166;1567;paul Giamatti is wonderful, too, as Braddock's coach.
I:12166;1568;It's a stock character and could have come across as a cartoon, but Giamatti embues it with such energy that you have to love him.
I:12166;1569;This is a wonderful actor and I'm really glad to see that he's had some bigger roles and gotten such good recognition recently.
I:12166;1570;putting, but mostly she holds her own with the heavyweight (in every sense of the word) Crowe and for a few moments I forgot it was Renee up there, acting, and actually saw her as Mae Braddock.
I:12166;1571;We all have our set of problems and seeing one person overcome his with honor and dignity is tremendously inspiring.
I:12166;1572;It's about a man whose love for his family drives him to make incredible sacrifices.
I:12166;1573;It's also about the Great Depression and how this one man rallied hope for countless people who were suffering.
I:12166;1574;We live in a time when cynicism is fashionable and any attempt at portraying honest human goodness is dismissed by some as hokey (read some of the one star comments) so it takes a certain courage to show this kind of story.
I:12166;1575;Obviously from reading the huge number of positive reviews, it strikes a chord with a lot of folks.
I:12166;1576;The Amazon instant watch has a great selection and is so convenient.
I:12166;1577;I am typically not a big fan of Russel Crowe, but he impressed me with this performance.
I:12166;1578;Renee Zellweger is great as well!
I:12166;1579;James Braddock is a model for all.
I:12166;1580;He is forever optimistic despite all setbacks.
I:12166;1581;He is a beacon of light for his hungry family.
I:12166;1582;This is undoubtedly the Story of Seabiscuit on two legs, but because we are dealing with one of the best film actors in the world, we can empathize readily.
I:12166;1583;forget Rocky, CM has fine fight scenes.
I:12166;1584;Thanks for the uplifting, Conservative message, Ron.
I:12166;1585;notch stars, notable director, unlimited production dollars = good movie.
I:12166;1586;The movie is a true.
I:12166;1587;life story of a boxer overcoming all odds during the depression.
I:12166;1588;The first 2/3s of the film show his struggle to keep his family together during the Great Depression, and the last 1/3 his rise to the top of boxing.
I:12166;1589;while Ron Howard is a convential director of tearjerking family movies, here the understated acting by Crowe, and simple story line, make for a moving film.
I:12166;1590;Unlike recent Spielberg or a host of talented directors, Howard manages to evoke sympathy for his protagonist.
I:12166;1591;Cinderalla Man is well worth seeing though, in its own right.
I:12166;1592;in this, she was perfect.
I:12166;1593;One of Russell Crowe's best efforts.
I:12166;1594;One of the classic movie lines of all time.
I:12166;1595;This movie reaches out and pulls on your heartstrings.
I:12166;1596;Regardless, they both give marvelous character portrayals in this film.
I:12166;1597;What life is really about.
I:12166;1598;Love of family and true values.
I:12166;1599;A must watch movie with the whole family
I:12166;1600;A great story on how a man love his family and the risk he took for them.
I:12166;1601;A movie that was recommended by a friend and they were right as it was very delightful to watch.
I:12166;1602;Superb acting, directing, and script makes this a must see movie.
I:12166;1603;This was truly a cinderella story, heartfelt and poinant.
I:12166;1604;He has a wife (Renee Zellweger), 3 beautiful children and a successful career as a professional boxer.
I:12166;1605;It turned out to be a much better movie for a lot of reasons.
I:12166;1606;First and foremost the boxing sequences are realistic and compelling.
I:12166;1607;Second Russell Crowe is absolutely convincing and credible as a man literally fighting to save his family from the ravages of the depression.
I:12166;1608;Ron Howard did an amazing job on this film and it succeeds as a human interest story , an historical drama and as a great boxing film.
I:12166;1609;The supporting cast is great.
I:12166;1610;Fine acting by Russell Crowe and excellent fight scenes .
I:12166;1611;There's much to love about this true story (well, true if you exclude the vilification of his final rival).
I:12166;1612;The movie was fantastic for the whole family to watch.
I:12166;1613;Both Russell and Rene are wonderful.
I:12166;1614;Would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:12166;1615;One of my all time favorites!
I:12166;1616;This is one of those real life stories that truly is almost too good to be true, a true story that out.
I:12166;1617;rocks ROCKY, with a far more likeable central character.
I:12166;1618;The tale is such a superb one that one would imagine it impossible to botch, though Ron Howard is one of the few directors capable of doing precisely that.
I:12166;1619;i would cite three main reasons the film manages to succeed:1) The basic story generated by Jim Braddock himself.
I:12166;1620;"My favorite moment in the telling of Braddock's amazing story might be during the interview before the title bout, when he explained that unlike the first half of his career, he now had a reason to fight: ""Milk."
I:12166;1621;2) The performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, who I have found to be two of the most consistently interesting actors of the past half decade.
I:12166;1622;There is an effortless intelligence in his performances that mask just how gifted he is.
I:12166;1623;Though there are many other excellent performances in the film, these two provide most of the reasons for watching it.
I:12166;1624;It remains to this day one of boxing's greatest fairytales.
I:12166;1625;In Cinderella Man (a phrase attributed to Damon Runyon), it is imperative that James Braddock's circumstances and those of his family are carefully, unhurriedly established to create an appropriate context for the process by which he resumed his career as a professional fighter in 1934 and then faced Max Baer on June 13th, 1935, in Long Island City, N.Y. Although a 10.1 underdog, Braddock won the heavyweight championship of the world.
I:12166;1626;(The film takes us to this point.)
I:12166;1627;Whatever his public persona may be, he demonstrates exceptional self.
I:12166;1628;discipline as well as nuanced talent in the lead role of the courageous heavyweight champion boxer.
I:12166;1629;Crowe brilliantly portrays Braddock's fundamental decency and integrity as well as his total devotion to the welfare of his wife and their three children.
I:12166;1630;To me, this is Crowe's finest performance thus far.
I:12166;1631;Crowe is perfectly likable as the 'Pride of New Jersey' and the champion of his wife's heart, being knocked down by the stock market crash of '29 and a broken right hand.
I:12166;1632;Knowing now that the difference between winning and losing is how much food and warmth he can provide for his wife and kids, Jim finds the motivation that he needed to win the match.
I:12166;1633;In this powerful scene, we truly feel the harsh reality of those times.
I:12166;1634;the supporting cast is exceptional:Renee Zellwegger is very good as Braddock's adoring wife.
I:12166;1635;paul Giamatti is terrific as the fast.
I:12166;1636;feared Max Baer whose pleasant face masks the heart of a man who will do anything to win.
I:12166;1637;"With dramatic images of the Depression Era, Howard's The Cinderella Man"" is a fine boxing motion picture, very entertaining and sentimental."
I:12166;1638;The boxing sequences are wonderfully photographed, bringing the audience right into the ring.
I:12166;1639;"We can really feel the cool, oily, smoky sweatiness of the ""world's most famous arena."""
I:12166;1640;I actually cried (a happy cry) because this man had to go throughhell and back to become a champion of boxing!
I:12166;1641;I HIGHLY recommendyou see this movie as it might make you cry too!
I:12166;1642;Hey, this movie is way cool.
I:12166;1643;The start of the movie is kinda slow but it is exciting because you don't know what the hell is going to go on next.
I:12166;1644;I enjoyed this for its moral theme about life and integrity during hard times.
I:12166;1645;There's been a lot of hand.
I:12166;1646;wringing analysis about why Ron Howard's terrific true.
I:12166;1647;whatever the reason, this gripping account of depression era, washed.
I:12166;1648;"russell Crowe is outstanding as Braddock, an honorable but ordinary ""everyman"" who became a symbol of a beaten."
I:12166;1649;this is great filmmaking by a director at the peak of his powers.
I:12166;1650;Wonderful period detail enhances the emotion in every frame of this inspiring story.
I:12166;1651;Crowe not only looks and sounds like Braddock, he masterfully recreates his boxing style.
I:12166;1652;it's strange how some actual lives hit all the beats that are the essentials of timeless, fictional stories.
I:12166;1653;extras include: The original Braddock/Baer fight, deleted scenes, a portrait of Braddock by family and friends and an enthusiastic commentary (one of three) by Howard.
I:12166;1654;From what we see of him in the film, Braddock was a kind, gentle man who loved his wife and tried to be the best father he could to his adoring children.
I:12166;1655;The scenes between Crowe and Renee Zellweger as Mae, Braddock's concerned but supportive wife, serve as the fulcrum that keeps the story balanced and interesting.
I:12166;1656;Ditto for the relationship between Braddock and Joe Gould, his devoted manager, beautifully played by Paul Giamatti.
I:12166;1657;We also see Braddock instilling a strong sense of moral values into his children despite the harsh conditions under which they live.
I:12166;1658;howard generates a tremendous amount of suspense in his closing scenes in which Braddock challenges the world's reigning champ, Max Baer, in a bout in Madison Square Garden Garden.
I:12166;1659;"thus, despite the occasionally lackluster storytelling and overindulgence in sentimentality, ""Cinderella Man"" scores as a moving tribute to a decent man who never gave up."
I:12166;1660;great story from the great depression, I love movies, and believe that you should at least watch a movie once, to at least say that you have seen it, you really cant knock a movie if you havent seen it.
I:12166;1661;I like this movie enough I added it my collection to watch it again.
I:12166;1662;Great story about a remarkable man, during some of the nations most trying times.
I:12166;1663;Gives us a view of how hard times were during the Great Deperssion.
I:12166;1664;Since it is a true story, it's a great success story, to be shared with family or co. workers.
I:12166;1665;One of my favorite movies ever!
I:12166;1666;This is a great movie.
I:12166;1667;If you can show it to the kids in an edited form do so.
I:12166;1668;It's amazing how Hollywood screenwriters can take pretty much any situation and weave the same tepid love story out of it.
I:12166;1669;The book explores how the lives of the two men unfolded as they moved towards the night they met in the ring, resulting in one of the greatest upsets in heavyweight boxing history.
I:12166;1670;Although the film is not based on the book, being a biopic of Braddock, it naturally covers some of the same territory.
I:12166;1671;Schaap is generous to all the men he portrays, creating a picture of a time and place in which, remarkably, there are few villians.
I:12166;1672;It's unfortunate because based on a reading of Schaap's book, it's clear that emphasizing the latter story could have made a very interesting film.
I:12166;1673;This film plots his rise to the top but it's just background for the love story.
I:12166;1674;The rest of the cast are okay.
I:12166;1675;"They're probably accurate but ""Cinderella Man"" is such a safe movie, you barely even need to see it to know how every scene will unfold."
I:12166;1676;Loved seeing them go from hating this movie to loving it and cheering at the end.
I:12166;1677;But after watching it today in this tough economy, I really enjoyed it so much more.
I:12166;1678;It's now one of my favorites!!
I:12166;1679;He really enjoyed this film.
I:12166;1680;It is a powerful story set in the depression .
I:12166;1681;this is a great movie and im not even a boxing fan.
I:12166;1682;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:12166;1683;Somehow, this one slipped by the movie.
I:12166;1684;Although there are all the things that go along with boxing in terms of violence and some trash talk, along with some mildly scary stuff, this is a movie you can watch with a 10 year old unreservedly, and you'll probably want to pull your family together a bit more tightly after seeing it.
I:12166;1685;"russell Crowe is his typical remarkable self
I:12166;1686;Well, there's an answer to that: it's worth seeing how the great ones do it, and when they do something that's been done less well by lesser lights, their brilliance shines through all the more.
I:12166;1687;"i rather suspect there is something else going on in some of the more negative reviews I've seen of this movie
I:12166;1688;jerk reaction to seeing topics like the importance of family explored in a positive and inspiring light.
I:12166;1689;It's true that it takes care to do this without being cheesy or seeming too much like an afterschool special, but again, in the hands of a capable filmmaker it can be inspirational.
I:12166;1690;The beauties of life are as central and worthy of exploration as the darknesses of it, but yet it often seems you are more likely to draw criticism for exploring what is good .
I:12166;1691;But it is done well here.
I:12166;1692;Rocky seems to have inspired this movie, despite it being based on a true story .
I:12166;1693;But it is a winner, and the boxing scenes are suprisingly lucid and fierce.
I:12166;1694;russell Crowe is Braddock, a flinty, good.
I:12166;1695;Howard directs the scenes inside the apartment like a one.
I:12166;1696;and he uses his decent speed to get inside his larger opponents and go to work.
I:12166;1697;They're some of the best boxing scenes ever filmed, both in visceral impact and intellectual depth .
I:12166;1698;in a way that stirs us while deepening our understanding of the ring.
I:12166;1699;"and the fight includes about 200 more landed punches than there actually was, but this is surely more exciting than the climactic fight in ""Ali,"" if not as artistic."
I:12166;1700;And while I'm sure Zellweger wanted to work opposite Crowe, she is cute and plucky and supportive to a fault, and has been in a bunch of roles, and it's getting a little old.
I:12166;1701;this movie knows the reward of a good
I:12166;1702;Perfect combination of romance, excitement, triumph and history!
I:12166;1703;This movie is such an eye opener to the Great Depression time period.
I:12166;1704;Russell Crowe is such a good actor and this movie is very touching.
I:12166;1705;The plot is great and it is even better because it is based on a true story.
I:12166;1706;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:12166;1707;it is in these areas that the film truely excels, this is surely the best recreation of early 30s America in recent memory.
I:12166;1708;mouthed and funny coach are where Howard hits gold.
I:12166;1709;He draws two characters who the audience will care deeply for and transcend the film into a true powerhouse picture.
I:12166;1710;"Somewhat reminiscent of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in its themes, this is classic entertainment where while we know how the film will end, we are still rooting for our hero and get emotionally involved."
I:12166;1711;This excellent film will linger long in the mind after the credits role.
I:12166;1712;Life's circumstances can bring the best down, but only the best get up and retrieve their dignity.
I:12166;1713;Nice to see a historical film for guys that's true and heart felt.
I:12166;1714;Really enjoyed the story of under.
I:12166;1715;Shows what Depression Era was like and what it can do to a family.
I:12166;1716;Is it the gritty truth of the boxing scenes, which are some of the best ever done?
I:12166;1717;"Ron Howard reunited with Crowe after their smash hit ""A Beautiful Mind,"" and it's plain to see that these two bring out the best in each other."
I:12166;1718;"james Braddock, the ""Bulldog of Bergen,"" opens the film as a contender for the light."
I:12166;1719;with a lot of help from his bedrock Mae .
I:12166;1720;"based on a true story, ""Cinderalla Man"" strives for greatness and almost makes it."
I:12166;1721;Cinderlla Man goes into the pantheon of excellent feel.
I:12166;1722;"good sports movies, like ""Rudy,"" ""Seabiscuit,"" and ""Legend,"" that are darn fine entertainment and worthy of our attention."
I:12166;1723;Missed this one when it came out and had someone suggest it, very glad that they did, a wonderful movie.
I:12166;1724;His movie's are either duds or Oscar worthy.
I:12166;1725;Russell Crowe is in prime form, here.
I:12166;1726;Rene's performance is the perfect complement to Crowe.
I:12166;1727;Yes, the boxing theme is a major part of this movie.
I:12166;1728;This film has tremendous, heart wrenching drama.
I:12166;1729;Top that with the incredible boxing action.
I:12166;1730;This movie offers so much more.
I:12166;1731;The feel good angle here will grab you.
I:12166;1732;Oh, and Rocky, move over, there's a new Champ!
I:12166;1733;But believe me when I tell you that this film is much more than just that.
I:12166;1734;The real story of Jim Braddock shows us how this boxer could bring hope to thousands, who were ready to give up at the time of the Great Depression.
I:12166;1735;It was the year 1928 and he was winning fights and becoming a serious contender for the light heavyweight championship.
I:12166;1736;He had a beautiful wife, three kids, a nice house, and an agent / friend who supported him through every step.
I:12166;1737;when the situation becomes untenable, Jim has to swallow his pride and accept welfare.
I:12166;1738;This movie provides a great look at the human being beyond the athlete.
I:12166;1739;And what a great guy we find!
I:12166;1740;Someone who has a iron will, who will do anything for his family as long as it is moral, and who provides a great example of what a father should be like.
I:12166;1741;Russell Crowe becomes Jim Braddock, and does so in such a convincing way that it is almost uncanny.
I:12166;1742;rennee Zellweger plays the role of Jim's wife, and she does so with passion and commitment.
I:12166;1743;"Also, the actor that delighted us in ""Sideways"", Paul Giamatti, delivers a praiseworthy performance, even though he has a secondary role."
I:12166;1744;His calm demeanor in this movie is almost funny to watch.
I:12166;1745;Besides the great acting and the wonderful story of Braddock's life, the film counts with excellent settings and costumes that help reenact the period perfectly.
I:12166;1746;this movie has taken the spot of my favorite drama with a sport's theme, and I cannot recommend it high enough!
I:12166;1747;As an underdog, all I can say is that this movie, or should I say the story of Braddock the comeback boxer, is so inspirational, motivating and moving.
I:12166;1748;Somehow someday a way will be opened to you.
I:12166;1749;I just can say all acted well, in particular the coach and the wife.
I:12166;1750;Excellent boxing scenes, good score.
I:12166;1751;I thought the movie was wonderful.
I:12166;1752;All the actors shined in this movie.
I:12166;1753;The story was beautiful and I thought Russell Crowe deserved and Oscar for his work in Cinderella Man.
I:12166;1754;I would definatley recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining, uplifting story with a couldnt.
I:12166;1755;I dont think that was a good thing.
I:12166;1756;But this had to be one of the most underrated movies in 2005.
I:12166;1757;Just a great movie that makes you root for the underdog !
I:12166;1758;He was a class act and a great father 'n
I:12166;1759;Though Howard fictionalizes his subjects, and does not pretend to make documentaries, he does accurately depict the feeling and the major points of his subjects.
I:12166;1760;Braddock is portrayed in a moving and powerful manner, with remarkable performances all around, one of the best scripts I can remember in recent years, and occasionally brutal action.
I:12166;1761;This movie is a must see.
I:12166;1762;Great acting and a realistic look into what life must have been like during the depression.
I:12166;1763;I just love this movie, and being a woman and this is about boxing you wouldn't think I would, but its a true story and it's a love story as well.
I:12166;1764;I watch this one over and over, it is beautifully done, but then it's a Ron Howard film so that explains it's perfection.
I:12166;1765;Russell Crowe did a really good job in his portrayal of James Braddock, another award winning performance for Crowe.
I:12166;1766;The story takes you back to the great depression era, and depicts an up and coming talented Irish boxer, James Braddock.
I:12166;1767;James Braddock, despite his circumstances, kept his spirits up, held it together long enough to triumph over the harshest opponent of all, survival of the times.
I:12166;1768;I will say that it was an excellent story, and very much worth watching.
I:12166;1769;Paul Giamatti gave an award winning performance as Braddock's boxing trainer.
I:12166;1770;And Ren e Zellweger was on top of her game once again.
I:12166;1771;most of the film takes place in the Depression, when Braddock (Russell Crowe) has lost his boxing license and is considered washed up.
I:12166;1772;no quarrel with the performances, and Crowe's physical transformation is impressive.
I:12166;1773;This moving and delightful film tells the true story of James Braddock who made a startling come back from the bottom edge of poverty to the boxing ring.
I:12166;1774;He captured the imagination of a nation hard hit with the depression.
I:12166;1775;This great film is packed with family values and profound lessons.
I:12166;1776;A worthwhile addition to a family film library.
I:12166;1777;THis movie takes us back to the great depression and portrays a story of a man going through the darkest moments of his life and he found the strenght to go on and at the end he was the inspiration of lots of people going through those difficult times.
I:12166;1778;This is an excellent and entertaining film that depicts the spirit of sports at its best.
I:12166;1779;He keeps winning unexpectedly in bouts against opponents who are likely to whip him.
I:12166;1780;nevertheless, this is a very good film portraying a classic American rags to riches story.
I:12166;1781;"What we have with ""Cinderella Man,"" Ron Howard's remake of the Jerry Lewis classic ""Cinderfella,"" is a vibrant mix of comedy and pathos."
I:12166;1782;Crowe brings a stylized sense of melancholy to the role and it works perfectly.
I:12166;1783;"Though not as madcap as Lewis was in the original, he still manages to let fly the occasional ""Hey, Laaaady"" with a surprisingly shrill vibrato."
I:12166;1784;paul Giamatti brings an eerie presence to the role of Cinderfella's Fairy Godfather.
I:12166;1785;Indeed, Giamatti's performance provides the ideal counterpoint to what for centuries has been a spurious fairytale with a bogus message.
I:12166;1786;She captures Cinderfella using the illusions women have used for centuries: spackled skin made perfect by layers of make.
I:12166;1787;up, breasts cinched to a high and full prominence, perfumed body and breath, and a demure glance that conceals all of the treachery in the female heart.
I:12166;1788;Director Howard presents one of the great denouements in film history when the camera pulls back to reveal the couple in post.
I:12166;1789;"there is no question that ""Cinderella Man"" will generate early Oscar buzz."
I:12166;1790;This is more than just a summer movie, it is a movie for our time and for all time.
I:12166;1791;I show it in my classroom as an example of hardship during the Great Depression.
I:12166;1792;This was a great movie.
I:12166;1793;We would watch it again and recommend it to many people.
I:12166;1794;The fact that this was a true story was what made it so inspiring.
I:12166;1795;It's about the importance of integrity, family, community, religious values, and keeping a sense of perspective and a sense of humor.
I:12166;1796;It's a grand story with an excellent cast of characters.
I:12166;1797;Just go and enjoy it.
I:12166;1798;When I saw this movie in Seattle, the audience cheered during the movie and applauded at the end.
I:12166;1799;Boxing is part of the story, but it is really about commitment within a family and with a co. worker.
I:12166;1800;When life is hard, some people give up on their commitment and values.
I:12166;1801;I must say that I loved this movie and originally bought the standard edition, now upgraded it to the Blu Ray version.
I:12166;1802;the video transfer is one of the very best I have seen.
I:12166;1803;To my eyes, this video transfer is simply outstanding.
I:12166;1804;there are a ton of excellent extras, most from 2005, and even a newsreel of the original heavyweight championship match between Braddock and Baer.
I:12166;1805;The acting was excellent all around and Russell Crowe even moved and looked like the real Cinderella Man.
I:12166;1806;Renee Zellweger's performance was the most sincere I have ever seen her and she should have gotten more attention for this.
I:12166;1807;"This is a wonderful movie
I:12166;1808;Cinematography, everything about this movie is excellent.
I:12166;1809;Russell Crowe is amazing as is Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellweger.
I:12166;1810;Its inspirational tale has all the trappings of a Hollywood fairy.
I:12166;1811;What makes this film special is the solid directing and the talented cast.
I:12166;1812;Howard continuously keeps the story moving at a steady pace while Crowe and Ren e Zellweger are excellent as the fallen boxer and his loyal and loving wife.
I:12166;1813;He steals practically every scene he is in and shows through his character how important it is for human beings to have compassion for one another.
I:12166;1814;"To sum things up succinctly, ""Cinderella Man"" is one of those special films that truly inspires while it entertains."
I:12166;1815;It is one of 5 I can watch over and over again!
I:12166;1816;It shows the true power of love and unity.
I:12166;1817;what a man is willing and able to go through for and because of it and the true power of the woman.
I:12166;1818;it really brings back into perspective what a REAL relationship is and should be.
I:12166;1819;I love this movie and the extras about the real life story.
I:12166;1820;One of the best movies I have seen in a long time .
I:12166;1821;it is both emotionally moving and inspirational.
I:12166;1822;The story takes you through the wrenching pain and agony of the depression and how one family dealt with it, and then raises you up to the highest heights of human hope and perseverance.
I:12166;1823;Congratulations to Ron Howard and all of the wonderful actors who were involved with this movie!
I:12166;1824;The backdrop of the Great Depression, his battle to hold his family together, and the value of friendship made this a truly memorable movie.
I:12166;1825;A very strong message about self.
I:12166;1826;Some tears will flow, but in the end you can't help letting a cheer escape your throat.
I:12166;1827;This movie will hold your attention from start to finish.
I:12166;1828;It has a little bit of Rocky for the action fans and a lot of in.your.
I:12166;1829;all the actors were true to their character and gave great performances.
I:12166;1830;Cinderella Man is truly a story about getting back up.
I:12166;1831;ron Howard is an absolute genius, and although I have not been an avid fan of Russell Crowe, his performance in the film has turned my head.
I:12166;1832;It is riveting, and for those of us who have fallen and gotten back up, he is our Patron Saint.
I:12166;1833;It is awesome, and everyone from 4.94 should see this.
I:12166;1834;There are VERY few curse words, a lovely concept, and the acting by Paul Giamatti is sublime.
I:12166;1835;You will not be sorry, it is a love story, a boxing movie, but above all, a movie that INSPIRES.
I:12166;1836;Well written script, brilliantly performed.
I:12166;1837;There's something in it for guys and gals.
I:12166;1838;What a man will do to provide for his family .
I:12166;1839;when I first watched this movie, I found it to be super.
I:12166;1840;Knowing what one is truly fighting for is a life necessity !
I:12166;1841;This should be viewed by everyone !
I:12166;1842;Cinderella Man (is this the best title they could come up with?

I:12166;1847;Russell Crowe brings it, as he portrays a fighter who must win against enormous odds to feed his family during the Great Depression.

I:12166;1851;Perhaps his villain was a bit exaggerated in the final act, but that is a small criticism for an otherwise terrific, heartwarming, and entertaining movie.
I:12166;1852;I love movies based upon true stories.
I:12166;1853;Crowe and Zellweger both provide their star power to a touching, historical story that lifts this family out of the Great Depression and gives them their lives back.
I:12166;1854;This movie pulls at the heart strings!
I:12166;1855;Great acting and a wonderful story!
I:12166;1856;This is an amazing movie.
I:12166;1857;In this world of quick food and everything done for us without effort this reminds us of how not too long ago people were destitute having to do whatever they could to survive.
I:12166;1858;It captures the essence of the will to live and pride in providing for your family amidst incredible strife and turmoil.
I:12166;1859;This also shows how one Cinderella story can be an inspiration to a generation and under the expert writing and directing can become an inspiration to even more generations.
I:12166;1860;It is definately worth watching and owning.
I:12166;1861;Russel Crowe's movie was superb and down to earth.
I:12166;1862;The movie is set during the Great Depression.
I:12166;1863;The Great Depression is also depicted quite realistically.
I:12166;1864;Renne Zellweger throws a nice effect to the movie, and Paul Giamatti brings in some great laughs.
I:12166;1865;I was really impressed with the acting in this movie, and how everything came together so nicely.
I:12166;1866;This is a must see movie!
I:12166;1867;This movie is excellently made and a wonderful inspiration to never give up and to be thankful for the second chances that are provided to us in life!

I:12166;1878;The film eventually leads to the dramatic finale, in which Braddock is giving the chance of a lifetime.
I:12166;1879;The true essence of Braddock (and Crowe with his superb performance) is outside of the ring, in which he spends time with his wife (Renee Zellweger) and children.
I:12166;1880;It is these tender moments and the trials and tribulations that Braddock endures for the ones he truly loves that shows not only the incredible horrors that people faced during the depression era, as well as the extraordinary love that Braddock and his wife Mae utilized to right the ship of life.
I:12166;1881;Director Ron Howard creates a supremely predictable film, but it is so well made and powerful that it does not even matter.
I:12166;1882;Cinderella Man is a true testament to hard.
I:12166;1883;Everything was good and worked, but there was a crack on the too of the case.
I:12166;1884;Russell Crowe is hands down the best actor around.
I:12166;1885;he is a fantastic actor.
I:12166;1886;And Paul Giamatti has got some chops as well.

I:12166;1888;He lives with his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their three kids in a nice home in New Jersey.

I:12166;1890;Winning that fight, he captures the attention of the boxing world and the rest of the country.
I:12166;1891;"Cinderella Man, directed by Ron Howard (""A Beautiful Mind"") is a near great film."
I:12166;1892;Howard does an outstanding job of bringing the Great Depression to life.
I:12166;1893;In an early scene, we see Jim and Mae enjoying their comfortable life.
I:12166;1894;This is an effective method of showing us the change in their circumstances.
I:12166;1895;"Howard is an accomplished filmmaker and ""Cinderella Man"" is yet another great example of his skill."
I:12166;1896;"working with Russell Crowe again, the two have created a film that is similar in some ways to their accomplished ""A Beautiful Mind""."
I:12166;1897;Consider that we just watched him beat the stuffing out of another boxer and then we immediately watch the same man reveal his vulnerability, yet in a very subtle, moving way.
I:12166;1898;Crowe does a brilliant job of portraying Braddock's skill in the ring and his love and devotion to his family, while struggling to deal with all of the hard moments in his life.
I:12166;1899;It is a great performance.
I:12166;1900;"paul Giamatti (""Sideways"", ""American Splendor"") shows once again why he is one of the best actors working in film."
I:12166;1901;When we finally realize what this element is, it comes as a big surprise, adding yet another layer of depth to the character.
I:12166;1902;Giamatti's character is complex and believable, an accomplishment for a supporting character.
I:12166;1903;howard always does a great job of finding great actors to fill the supporting roles, which makes his films that much stronger.

I:12166;1907;Howard creates films with an attention to detail that is very high.
I:12166;1908;He makes us believe that we are watching astronauts in a spaceship or a brilliant but confused person walking through Princeton.
I:12166;1909;The boxing matches benefit greatly from Howard's high level of attention to detail.
I:12166;1910;This is a good example of how real these matches seem.
I:12166;1911;And yet another reason Howard's films are so accomplished and enjoyable.
I:12166;1912;one thing that you can always count on is that Howard will amass a cast of highly skilled actors who will own their respective roles.
I:12166;1913;"In ""Cinderella Man"", this is accomplished with one minor exception."
I:12166;1914;Zellweger is a good actress, creating some memorable characters, and she is quite good as Mae, but she isn't as good as Crowe.
I:12166;1915;It is amazing to watch the difference.
I:12166;1916;Crowe is doing a brilliant job of creating his character while Zellweger is doing a good job.
I:12166;1917;balance and robs the film of greatness.
I:12166;1918;Cinderella Man is a near great film about a real person who stirred the passions of America at a time when they needed a hero.
I:12166;1919;It is an extremely well done movie.
I:12166;1920;A family man who faces hardship but perseveres with strength and grace.
I:12166;1921;To know that it was based on fact makes it even more touching.
I:12166;1922;"Actors are excellent
I:12166;1923;This is a must for any video collection.
I:12166;1924;but this is mighty close!
I:12166;1925;Spectacular movie, a must see!
I:12166;1926;russell Crowe is extraordinary in this film.
I:12166;1927;"explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."""
I:12166;1928;the impact of this film on the viewer is as powerful as Rocky and Million Dollar Baby.
I:12166;1929;While all three films have boxing and love of the underdog as a common theme, this movie is much more.
I:12166;1930;The backdrop of the movie is Depression.
I:12166;1931;They professionally played their parts and let the story be the real star.
I:12166;1932;By a twist of fate, he is given another chance to fight, and his career begins again.
I:12166;1933;key dignity and honor that we wish we all had.
I:12166;1934;While this is a serious drama, it has a lot of light humor throughout the picture that is entertaining and appropriate.
I:12166;1935;Director Ron Howard does a wonderful storytelling job and has kept directorial tricks to a minimum.
I:12166;1936;The fight scenes were the most real I have seen in any movie.
I:12166;1937;The story was about boxing, but more, it was about a man struggling to support his family, and to stay true to his values of honesty and responsibility, despite the hardships of the Great Depression.
I:12166;1938;And it was truly heart.
I:12166;1939;(In both its setting and its heart.
I:12166;1940;warming inspiration, it reminded me of a great film of a couple years ago, Seabiscuit.)
I:12166;1941;Knowing how close this story touched to the milieu of my mother's childhood in New York and New Jersey in the 1930s added to the meaning for me.
I:12166;1942;Ron Howard did a great job directing this, conveying a vivid sense of what lives were like then, including the combination of blissful semi.
I:12166;1943;ignorance and fear and uncertainty experienced by the children of that time.
I:12166;1944;Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger were both amazing in their roles, flawlessly personifying their characters.
I:12166;1945;Russell Crowe does a great job of portraying his character in a three.
I:12166;1946;The story itself is inspiring and though provoking.
I:12166;1947;It turned out to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:12166;1948;It showed a man who loved his family and did whatever it took to take care of them .
I:12166;1949;It is a must see family movie .
I:12166;1950;It really is one of the great unsung, unheraldeds of '05.
I:12166;1951;"Brilliant and visceral acting by Russell Crowe (never utter the word ""whatever"" to him, by the way) and Renee Zellweger and compelling, explosive, cinematic storytelling."
I:12166;1952;"That, and some of the best movie fight scenes since ""Raging Bull""."
I:12166;1953;This has to be one of the great tellings of this particular fable .
I:12166;1954;a. k. a. the Cinderella Man, was to become one of the most surprising sports legends in history.
I:12166;1955;luck as much of the rest of the American populace who had hit rock bottom.
I:12166;1956;Driven by love, honor and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true.
I:12166;1957;Suddenly, the ordinary working man became the mythic athlete.
I:12166;1958;fighter James J. Braddock is a work of art.
I:12166;1959;This is a truly great movie.
I:12166;1960;I enjoyed the movie because it takes you back to the day when a man truly loved his family and no matter how hard the struggle they stayed together.
I:12166;1961;i would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:12166;1962;Easily one of the best movies of the year if not the century.
I:12166;1963;And the film's results at this summer's box.
I:12166;1964;in fact, 'Cinderella Man' is a well.
I:12166;1965;true' type of story, the good acting and production designs raises the film several rank higher than where it might have been.
I:12166;1966;And special mention to Craig Bierko, heavy weight champ 'Max Baer' who killed two boxers on the ring, and can smile and brag his power.
I:12166;1967;The film runs as long as 2h 24mins, but the length is no problem here with a good story and acting.
I:12166;1968;I really thought so at first).
I:12166;1969;as a film 'Cinderella Man' has flaws, but the actors are certainly Oscar worthy.
I:12166;1970;And it is a good example to prove that a good story well told never fails to move us.
I:12166;1971;This movie was great and although I am not a Crowe fan, I really enjoyed this movie.
I:12166;1972;CINDERELLA MAN tells a condensed tale about the life of Jim Braddock, one.
I:12166;1973;time heavyweight champion of the world.
I:12166;1974;glamour sport of its time, Braddock was a promising up and coming fighter.
I:12166;1975;up Jim Braddock wins his match.
I:12166;1976;In doing so, he captures the love of a nation and inspires its citizens during the darkest hours of the Great Depression.
I:12166;1977;the acting performances in CINDERELLA MAN are quite remarkable.
I:12166;1978;James Braddock was the Depression era Average Joe's role model and Crowe was perfectly cast for the role.
I:12166;1979;paul Giamatti once again returns to his roots of a supporting actor, portraying Braddock's longtime friend and manager, Joe Gould.
I:12166;1980;Ron Howard can be a very talented director.
I:12166;1981;nevertheless, CINDERELLA MAN is a powerful film.
I:12166;1982;"Russell Crowe may be the Marlon Brando of the 21st century after 5 years of great films, his greatest is stil Gladiator and now his second greatest is Ron Howard's uplifting masterpiece ""Cinderella Man"" this good hearted biographical story of depression era boxer Jim Braddock, who brought hope to those in the great depression."
I:12166;1983;a shining and starlighting triumph that is Ron Howard's greatest film, and by the magic of Ron Howard I can't believe my eyes and ears that not many people went to go see this beautiful picture, it did come out at the wrong time.
I:12166;1984;"It's still wonderess to behold, a real fairy tale hence the title ""Cinderella Man"" one of Hollywood's greatest motion pictures."
I:12166;1985;Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are marvelous.
I:12166;1986;See this entertainment gem before the oscars.
I:12166;1987;I thought this was a very good movie all the way around.
I:12166;1988;Also Max was the clown prince of boxing and an easy going partier who loved to have a good time and was good natured.
I:12166;1989;that said Russell Crowe and Craig Bierko shine as the two great fighters.
I:12166;1990;The story is a natural underdog story.
I:12166;1991;Renee Zellweger is good in her role and Paul Giamani is excellent as his Crowes trainer.
I:12166;1992;good movie check it out.
I:12166;1993;Cinderella Man is an outstanding, superb film that was overlooked by the press and consequently, fared rather poorly at the box office (grossing less than $70 million).
I:12166;1994;ironically, however, Cinderella Man is one of the best movies of 2004.
I:12166;1995;cinderella Man is an outstanding film because it has all the necessary ingredients.
I:12166;1996;The acting is phenomenal, with Crowe giving his best performance since Gladiator (2000), as the rugged Irish.
I:12166;1997;Renee Zellweger delivers a superb performance as Braddock's wife, Mae .
I:12166;1998;check out that North Jersey accent!
I:12166;1999;The film crew does a really nice job of re.
I:12166;2000;nonetheless, Cinderella Man is one of the finest movies in recent years, and one of the greatest boxing films ever produced.

I:12166;2005;Fine acting and great cast.
I:12166;2006;My mom who is very picky about movies, liked this one.
I:12166;2007;"Ron Howard's last two movies, ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Cinderella Man,"" are perhaps his most accomplished, and they star Russell Crowe at perhaps his most appealing."
I:12166;2008;"Baby was about a controversial social issue
I:12166;2009;life James Braddock boxing to feed his family during the Depression and inspiring hope among the impoverished, the way Seabiscuit at the time inspired the same people.
I:12166;2010;it's a sentimental story, told without sentimentality, about a man given a second chance.
I:12166;2011;creation of period is spot.
I:12166;2012;on, the fight sequences are choreographed closely to the real fights and photographed with exactitude, and the venues for the fights are triumphs of location and set design.
I:12166;2013;In short, this movie is the real thing, really well made, and really moving.
I:12166;2014;crowe makes Braddock a decent man, a father devoted to his wife and kids.
I:12166;2015;"Giamatti, who deserves an Oscar nod, and Zwellinger (her second boxing film after ""Jerry Maguire"") provide skilled support."
I:12166;2016;disc collector's edition: it has hit.
I:12166;2017;Of the deleted scenes, the director says they are good enough for the final cut, portending a post.
I:12166;2018;Russell Crowe was amazing this was the first movie I had ever seen him in and he got my attention right away.
I:12166;2019;This movie was incredable it was touching and I loved how it was a true story.
I:12166;2020;This part gives him the full scope to develop the yin and the yang of his manliness.
I:12166;2021;He displays both physical courage and sweeping tenderness.
I:12166;2022;"This is an inspirational story that will appeal to every generation from the ""Greatest Generation,"" who lived through the depresssion lovingly represented here, to the Boomers who grew up on stories about it, to their children ."
I:12166;2023;Really a very sweet film.
I:12166;2024;Maybe someday someone will make an interesting film that tells the story of Max Baer.
I:12166;2025;He's a good actor but he's such a creep in real life.
I:12166;2026;He loved his family and he tries so hard to keep his family feed and off the street during the Great Depression.

I:12166;2035;make your kids see it, to appreciate what they have
I:12166;2036;A great deal of effort in conditioning etc. went into this movie.
I:12166;2037;The effort shows that in the performance.
I:12166;2038;One of my favorite movies, the costumes, casting, depression era setting ie.
I:12166;2039;Even though Russell crow is a bit of a jerk , from what ive read , he is an incredibly sensitive caring husband and father.

I:12166;2041;The movie is well acted and illustrates the hardships many faced at the time and place where it is set.
I:12166;2042;For an athlete, especially a boxer, James J Braddock exhibits a strong sense of morality which he conveys to his children and becomes, justifiably, a hero of the nation.
