1;This is a good movie, based on a true story of a nun who helpes a guy on death row, giving him all the support she can .
2;but a great cast, and a good commentary by Tim Robbins make up for these faluts.
3;then you might reply:isn't this picture a little heavy on the side?Wrong, even if it could have been, but SEAN PENN and SUSAN SARANDON play their characters with great honesty and gradually they should win you over.
4;if you still wonder if this is a director's picture, now you are right ,since only the story counts here ,but the treatment is earnest.
5;The movie itself is a best seller, a required viewing for serious movie buffs.
6;The movie stars Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon, both nominated to the Academy Awards for this movie (Sarandon won the best actress award), also the director Tim Robbins (Susan Sarandon's husband) was nominated.
7;An interesting drama with very good performances, particularly the Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon performances.
8;One of the best written, directed, and portrayed films of all times.
9;Just as you think you have decided, once and for all, how you feel about the issue, it pulls you right back the other way.
10;It leaves you able to make your own decisions about this all too important issue.
11;Coming to your convictions is so much harder and up to you.
12;best movie in every way possible.
13;This movie still brings me to tears every time I watch it.
14;first off, Susan Sarandon definitely earned her Oscar for this role.
15;I was also impressed at the level of impartiality that they were able to attain in presenting the story.
16;it's the last minute humanity that we see from Matthew which comes from a stubborn nun who refuses to give up on him.
17;the only reason I didn't give it five stars is I have read the book and found it be exceedingly better.
18;In fact, if you enjoyed this movie, you absolutely must read the book!
19;I was moved by the way the movie developed the character of the intended exacution victim and the character of the Nun who visited him and helped him to deal with the realities of his pending death.
20;seriously, it tore out my heart and stomped on it.
21;She agrees, despite the pressure she has from the community and the victims families to separate herself from this man.
22;The film takes us into the relationship between these two people and slowly and subtly lets us inside their minds.
23;what could have proved itself nothing more than a sappy preachy film about inhumane/humane (depending on your stance) acts of justice becomes so much more thanks to the brilliant performances by the entire cast, the two leads in particular.
24;Susan Sarandon is one of our greatest working actresses, and she always succeeds in impressing me, but this is probably her finest performance (and Oscar agreed).
25;Not only that, but this may very well be one of the finest performances by any actress, ever.
26;As Sister Helen Prejean she truly grabs hold of this woman's soul, her inner demons and her beauty within.
27;She is so raw, so human and real that one can't help but fall into her plight and stand beside her strength.
28;Her final scenes with Penn devastate me and caused me to burst into tears.
29;As Matthew Poncelet, Penn creates a monster that is so real and so human that we can't help by sympathize with him.
30;This was probably the smartest direction Tim Robbins could have gone for it accomplishes what he set out to do, create a film without bias that addresses both side of the coin.
31;This rift in my own feelings may very well be the reason I consider this to be one of the finest films ever made, for it addresses those same contradictions with intelligence and honesty.
32;"I believe this to be one of the topnotch ""issue"" films ever made."
33;One walks away from it with an overwhelming understanding for the basest instincts in humanity and how they are intricately woven into all our psyches.
34;I really enjoyed Dead Man Walking because it shows the murderers point of view as well as the victims` families` sides.
35;it gives a good impression about the suffering of everyone who is concerned in cases of the death penalty.
36;A subtly crafted script, brilliant performances by Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon and a delicate portrayal of events that lead to the execution of Sean Penn .
37;and most compellingly, the act of execution itself .
38;gives the audience a first.
39;hand exposure to the trauma experienced by those involved.
40;it is indeed a very fine line.
41;is it right to end a life regardless of who, when, why, how?
42;In an enthralling climatic episode, the scenes of the brutal and shameless crime are brilliantly juxtaposed to the sophisticated act of execution.
43;The breathtaking cathartic moments of this episode leave the audience with the big question .
44;is taking a life right?
45;a must watch movie that leaves us with an issue to ponder over.
46;But mainly the film explores in detail the efforts of Sister Helen Prejean to help the felon find that even murderers and rapists are children of God.
47;Both Sarandin and Penn give superb and convincing performances.
48;Tim Robbins is excellent as the director.
49;The camera work is stark and true to life.
50;I highly recommend this film.
51;Of course, it takes him, his Elvis hair, his colorful fake tattoos, and his icy blue eyes to draw in the viewers and make them think that it is a fascinating film about a cool looking guy.
52;She displays a perfect set of emotions for her character, and she does very well at key moments.
53;Henceforth, it ceases to be surprising if one knew the story.
54;"forward story with no real surprises
I:21364;55;Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads.
I:21364;56;Of course, no film is 100% unbiased, especially when it comes to such serious issues as these, but I liked it.
I:21364;57;Features one of the most chilling and realistic scenes of an execution ever to be captured on celluloid.
I:21364;58;I generally like movies based on true stories, and this one is well told.
I:21364;59;She answered, and he asked her to come visit him.
I:21364;60;But the older man got a life sentence, while Matthew got a death sentence.
I:21364;61;She goes to visit his family and those of both the victims.
I:21364;62;All I have to say on the matter is make sure you have a full box of tissues before you start this one.
I:21364;63;So some of the most emotional scenes are about religion.
I:21364;64;No matter what your feelings about the death penalty might be, viewers will find that this two hour film is a sensitive, thoughtful, and thought provoking look at the highest debated and controversial political issue of today.
I:21364;65;under the tender guidance of director Tim Robbins, the cast and crew bring this emotionally charged story to life.
I:21364;66;Far from being biased or bigoted, it is refreshing in its neutrality.
I:21364;67;Views from each sides of this topic are presented and discussed deeply.
I:21364;68;susan Sarandon won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in this film, and no wonder"
69;That is how realistically convincing she is.
70;He dominates every scene in which he appears, and he deserves five stars, kudos, plaudits, and then some for this performance.
71;In that instance, Hopkins deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar.
72;It is the work of man that also can make mistakes.
73;it really touched me and made me cry.
74;i am a religous person and it is my conviction that one day all suffering will belong to the past and all souls will be saved.
75;the movie makes you think and touches your hart.
76;I watched this for a class and liked the story and the passion of the characters, however there were times when I could not understand the lines spoken as they were too soft.
77;this movie's greatest strength is the tremendous performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.
78;Both were given Academy Award nominations for their roles, and Sarandon actually won the Oscar for Best Actress.
79;altering from her friendship with Matthew Poncelet.
80;when it first came out, this movie generated a great deal of public discussion about the death penalty.
81;regardless of your stance on this controversial subject, this movie is guaranteed entertainment, and a definite must.
82;This is an interesting movie that explores the concepts of capitol punishment.
83;(This begins an interesting subplot that will come full circle.)
84;And we start to wonder what gives us the right to take the life of even a criminal.
85;We can see that Sarandon gets little help from those she should.
86;It will in fact increase right up until the end.
87;Sarandon's arguably strongest moment is when she tells Penn to just keep his eyes on her face as sentence is carried out.
88;But if you are against it, you probably will like it a lot despite its profound sadness.
89;This is a brilliant masterpiece that showcases the talents of two fine performers(Penn and Sarandon).
90;Film is based on true events that happened in Louisiana involving man on death row and the spiritual advisor who consults with him during his last few days on death row.
91;Acting and writing are all top.
92;There are good supporting players too including R. Lee Ermey(Full Metal Jacket.
93;Dead Man Walking and Thelma and Louise are my favorite movies, but I have many.
94;It is controversial and edgy due to the debate over the death penalty.
95;They both are my very favorite actors, and did so well together in this film.
96;Sean, had the Cajun accent down very well.
97;Almost to the point where it was a bit difficult to understand it, at times, that's how good it is.
98;Loved, loved loved, the musical score.
99;It is haunting, and mysterious, and very well done.
100;It is very emotional music.
101;i wanted both Susan and Sean to win the Oscar together but Susan did win for her role in this.
102;He is in jail for murder, the person willing to help his family is Sister.
103;Susan Sarandon nailed a Best Actress Oscar for her sensitive but practical portrayal of the nun who turns spiritual advisor to Sean Penn's condemned character.
104;Looking every bit like someone capable of murder, Penn basks in one of the best performances of his career in an Oscar.
105;nominated tour de force, and the unlikely Sarandon.
106;penn combination is subtly electrifying.
107;In the end, director Robbins may be asking us to reassess our own position on capital punishment, and his film is a provocative and educational tool to use in starting that re.
108;She began to see him as a human soul, and this emerges in her eloquent writing.
109;This book tells us of one human soul, and the sister who perceived him.
110;I very much enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others.
111;DEAD MAN WALKING is one of the most powerful films I have seen in a long time.
112;"In terms of pure ""guts,"" this film takes the cake."
113;This film is a testament to good filmmaking: great technique, beautiful shots, outstanding performances, and the avoidance of clich .
114;Instead, the film becomes a well.
115;In the end, the film evolves into an exploration of the possibility of redemption, quite apart from any issues concerning justice.
116;Their performances are simply stunning.
117;Her performance breathes and her journey allows the audience to follow her path, providing us with an emotional trajectory.
118;Sean Penn, once again, proves that he is pretty much the best actor working right now.
119;In particular, the last twenty minutes of the film are incredibly heart.
120;dEAD MAN WALKING is a fine film and one that I don't hesitate to give five stars.
121;Excellent flick, one of Sean Penn's best movies, definatly tops Fast Times At Ridgemont High
122;Dead Man Walking is a great drama released in 1995 starring Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon.
123;It was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.
124;This true story was adapted into movie brilliantly.
125;The emotional impact is present in every scene and every word.
126;Such intensity keeps audience interested the whole time.
127;This also opens the debate about death row in the US.
128;He wonderfully created every scene with his own emotional impact, which is clearly expressed.
129;Susan Sarandon won an Oscar for Best Actress for her portrayal of Sister Helen (the real Sister Helen is seen in the candlelighting memorial).
130;Her research of the events and the people is prevelant.
131;His heart and soul is poured into every scene, namely his breaking down scenes.
132;Both actors' own emotional impact makes this movie a more unforgettable experience.
133;"Bruce Springsteen's theme song, also called ""Dead Man Walking"", is a great song and performance to represent such a powerful movie."
134;"The movie ""Dead Man Walking"" is great for those looking for a powerdrama."
135;This will surely please audiences for many more years.
136;This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to.
137;the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
138;Buoyed by two memorable performances, Dead Man Walking is the charged narrative of a convicted killer brought to redemption by a selfless nun.
139;It manages to bring to the screen one of the most original polemics on capital punishment ever.
140;Director Tim Robbins gives us an emotionally complex look at the human ugliness on all sides of the issue.
141;Written and acted with a rare honesty, Dead Man Walking challenges our all.
142;Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn are amazing actors each in their own rights.
143;Put them together and you get sparks and intense emotion woven beautifully in a story of redemtion and humanity.
144;I've seen this movie twice 15 years apart and both times It left me speachless.
145;Dead Man Walking, directed by Tim Robbins, is a movie masterpiece.
146;It boasts a fabulous supporting cast, yet the real stars are Sean Penn, who plays Matthew Poncelot, a man convicted of two brutal murders, waiting for execution, and Susan Sarandon as Sisten Helen Prejean, who, in real life, wrote the book from which this film was adapted.
147;She becomes his spiritual advisor, and his close (and only) friend.
148;this film is so wonderful not just because of its cast, but of it's non.
149;It is an emotional masterpiece, stirring every single kind of emoition.
150;it is by far one of the best movies ever made.
151;"He meets a Nun, played by Susan Sarandon, who I loved since ""Bull Durham"" (the BEST baseball film!)"
152;and she shows him that he has a conscience after all.
153;the film teaches a lot about the inhumanity of the Death Penalty and gives us two master performances.
154;This is the best movie!
155;Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon have distinguished themselves as two of the best actors of their generation.
156;This film had the courage to explore issues within issues with guts.
157;Without a doubt Dead Man Walking is absolutely one of the best cinematic collaborations ever made.
158;Arrived quickly in excellent condition.
159;with issues that for some of us are better hidden away from public view, managed by experts whom we are happy to pay to do our dirty work.
160;for me this film raised a storm of emotion.
161;the sound track is deeply evocative and the mixture of Indian traditional Classical Sitar interwoven with the equally classical sounds of the Deep South wore exceptionally well.
162;What she will encounter on this journey will be an experience unlike anything she has ever encountered, as she must try to bring him to the realization that he must atone for his crimes in order to receive God's salvation.
163;this is, without a doubt, one of the best films of 1995, as well as any year.
164;The film has courage and strength, as well as portraying both of these qualities in its characters, who are given room and time to develop the story on their own terms.
165;this is done with some of the most powerful acting performances I've ever seen in a film.
166;Susan Sarandon is totally convincing as Sister Helen, who is portrayed as timid on the outside but posesses a strong will and determination to accomplish what she has sought out to do.
167;Her kind nature and caring heart are the perfect contrast for Sean Penn, who brings a terrific balance of contempt and sorrow to the character of Poncelet.
168;Sister Helen visits both the family of Poncelet, and the families of the murder victims, all of whom feel intense emotion and sadness over the crimes.
169;The movie builds up so emotion before this final scene that one cannot help but feel some contempt for those who would even wish to see such an event take place.
170;a very simple story with complex emotions and compelling characters, Dead Man Walking is a film that will touch the hearts of all who see it, religious and non.
171;This is as good as movies get, and not much better than this, either.
172;It is a thought provoking movie, well done.
173;"god's love works positively
I:21364;174;Dead Man Walking is a masterpiece of realism, emotional intensity, and balance.
I:21364;175;The cinematic device of cutting from scenes of dialogue between Helen and the prisoner to those of the horrible rape and murder have incredible impact .
I:21364;176;conflict is enormous, but Helen's ability to have Christian love for one she is .
I:21364;177;not sure she can like is a powerful echo of the forgiving words of the Lord she follows.
I:21364;178;i also liked that it showed both sides.
I:21364;179;i liked sister Helen's role in this movie.
I:21364;180;She had a very interesting role and the way she dealed with this situation was goos, because it was very problematic.
I:21364;181;DEAD MAN WALKING examines all sides of the coin, from the eyes of the victims, their families, the legal system, religious counselors and finally the convict himself.
I:21364;182;susan Sarandon perfectly portrays a kind and gentle Sr.
I:21364;183;Susan Sarandon plays Sister Helen and was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the movie.
I:21364;184;The film and the roles are intense, brilliant, powerful and strong.
I:21364;185;the movie was a box office sensation in 1995.1996.
I:21364;186;The acting in the movie is excellent for the entire cast.
I:21364;187;I think this movie sends a very good message, even to someone who is for the death penalty.
I:21364;188;God forgives anyone, you just have to ask this movie shows that very well!
I:21364;189;Excellent 5 stars I give this product
I:21364;190;This movie dead man walking is a very controversial but impressive movie.
I:21364;191;it proves that we are all human and that we all all bleed the color red.
I:21364;192;it proves that love overcomes anything and that faith still in fact does exist.
I:21364;193;it also deals a lot with hope and pain.
I:21364;194;Let me start about by saying that I can see why Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn won awards for best actress in a leading role and best actor in a leading roll.
I:21364;195;They feel that this is the right thing to do.
I:21364;196;This film after you watch it will make you ask these questions.
I:21364;197;So this is why I love this film because it doesn't just focus on one point of view but, both points of view.
I:21364;198;This film was the supreme test to Susan Sarandon and her best achievement in her career.
I:21364;199;In this role as nun she gave a masterful class of facial expression and body language , having in mind she had the camera very close the ninety five per cent of the time.
I:21364;200;this delicate theme about the death execution had never focused with admirable realism.
I:21364;201;As he proved in Mystic River, Sean Penn is an amazing actor and this movie wouldn't be the same without him.
I:21364;202;this film is so moving, it will bring tears to your eyes and will make you re.
I:21364;203;What it did was present one of the most well.
I:21364;204;the performances of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn are some of the best I've seen in any film recently.
I:21364;205;For a two hour movie to explore such complicated ideas as death and faith is quite an amazing feat.
I:21364;206;The movie Death Man Walking is definitely worth to be seen.
I:21364;207;The movie has not been made to convince people to switch sides, whether they are pro or contra death penalty, but it makes you thoughtful about your own opinion.
I:21364;208;In my opinion Tim Robbins succeeded in making a realistic film.
I:21364;209;The fact that it is based on the book by the real Sister Helen avoids that it seems to be pure invention.
I:21364;210;Futhermore Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn did a very good job because thy did not seem to play a role, but to be the characters.
I:21364;211;They managed to create an intimacy although they have no physical contact.
I:21364;212;It just shows both sides so that the watcher can form an own judgement about the subject.
I:21364;213;Lots of good actors in this.
I:21364;214;I liked the film because it tried to be neutral with the death penalty.
I:21364;215;Dead Man Walking is a rare gem of a movie.
I:21364;216;heart propaganda, and truly shines because the film .
I:21364;217;like Prejean's wonderful book .
I:21364;218;dead Man Walking is as fine a piece of filmmaking as anyone can ask, with excellent preformances all around (Sarandon won a Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Prejean).
I:21364;219;This film is complicated enough to wrestle with that issue and come out as a shining example of the level of thought that can go into one production.
I:21364;220;Those who are interested in a layered piece of human experienced universalized, Dead Man Walking is highly recommended.
I:21364;221;Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn give riveting performances as the main characters in this film.
I:21364;222;Prejean also grows to genuinely care for Poncelet, and he of her, as well.
I:21364;223;sarandon won an Academy Award as best actress for her role as Prejean, and Penn was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Poncelet.
I:21364;224;This is a gripping, realistic drama about life on death row, and Penn and Sarandon make it seem very life.
I:21364;225;I highly recommend this moving film.
I:21364;226;Dead Man Walking is Sean Penn at his very best.
I:21364;227;He should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of convicted murderer, Matthew Poncelet.
I:21364;228;This dark story is lifted into excellence by the wonderful script and the excellent acting by all concerned.
I:21364;229;Even the set decoration is wonderful.
I:21364;230;It's the finest acting I've ever seen him do.
I:21364;231;And, what a joy to see an actress do a part like this with no makeup at all.
I:21364;232;This is possibly the best directing of a film I've ever witnessed.
I:21364;233;Tim Robbins did a masterful job.
I:21364;234;The movie has power and grace.
I:21364;235;It also makes a statement about the death penalty.
I:21364;236;sean Penn and Susan Sarandon are excellent in this film.
I:21364;237;A double tour de force from writer.
I:21364;238;A mature, gripping screenplay that doesn't pretend to provide glib answers to the many difficult questions it raises.
I:21364;239;such a powerful script demanded careful casting decisions, and Director Robbins scored a series of coups, assembling a roster of actors at the peak of their talents.
I:21364;240;Susan Sarandon, a consistently fine actress, glows with inner conviction as Sister Helen, searching to apply spiritual truths in the unfamiliar realm of Death Row.
I:21364;241;winning performance is given an added measure of power by Sean Penn's wrenching portrait of composite killer Matthew Poncelot.
I:21364;242;The carefully composed camera shots are best appreciated in the film's original widescreen aspect ratio.
I:21364;243;video transfer of a superb movie, exploring a subject that will no doubt continue to be heatedly debated in American society for many years to come.
I:21364;244;I originally had this movie on tape and finally bought it on blu.
I:21364;245;Incredible movie and amazing performances.
I:21364;246;I highly recommend and I am looking forward to seeing this movie again.
I:21364;247;This movie will make you see both sides of the coin of the death penalty debate.
I:21364;248;Penn is ideally cast as the convict, but Susan Sarandon's stripped.
I:21364;249;down performance as his spiritual guide is courageous, gut.
I:21364;250;wrenching work, fully meriting that year's Oscar.
I:21364;251;The movie is well directed and acted and is very emotional.
I:21364;252;Sean Penn delivers a powerful performance as a man angry with the world yet unable to come to grips, or deal with the crime he was involved with.
I:21364;253;A powerful movie and well worth a look at.
I:21364;254;god, I LOVE a movie with a happy ending!
I:21364;255;This is a real winner.
I:21364;256;It has got to be Penn's best performance, ever!
I:21364;257;Also Susan Sarandon has an excellent performance too, winning the academy award.
I:21364;258;Very clear in Blue ray!!!!
I:21364;259;That nun held his hand, said Goodbye and he had the chance to say his Goodbye's .
I:21364;260;I say, What a nice way to go because his victims didn't have such opportunities.
I:21364;261;The actors, the story, the filming itself was well done.
I:21364;262;It must have been good to elicit such strong emotion from me.
I:21364;263;Doing good for goodness sakes.
I:21364;264;Every side is seen, and we also sympathize with each side.
I:21364;265;the movie is about salvation and redemption of a sinner, and gives hope that no one is too far gone for forgiveness.
I:21364;266;All this, without an ounce of feeling like a Christian movie.
I:21364;267;Sean Penn gives the finest performace, undoubtedly, of his life.
I:21364;268;He had me in tears for pretty much the whole movie.
I:21364;269;Susan S is also just amazing, as it director Tim Robbins.
I:21364;270;But also keep in mind that every form of human expression IS political to some degree.
I:21364;271;How can it not be?Sean Penn is my new hero, simply by virtue of this movie.
I:21364;272;You'll be an emotional basketcase afterwards, but you will appreciate this movie.
I:21364;273;It is a very emotional movie .
I:21364;274;What I like is that everyone will think about the movie after watching it regardless of his opinion about the death penalty.
I:21364;275;The flashbacks are very well used to show the thoughts and impressions that Sister Helen has about Matt.
I:21364;276;this movie is unique because it shows another kind of `hero' than the usual brutal heroes that are presented in every other Hollywood movie.
I:21364;277;This is kind of a black.
I:21364;278;All in all I recommend this movie since it is extremely famous and you must have seen it!!
I:21364;279;it is certainly true that the victim's families are given a powerful voice, especially that of Clyde Percy, played with seething perfection by R. Lee Ermey.
I:21364;280;I really believe that if rape and double.
I:21364;281;This is such an emotional film and the story behind it is amazing.
I:21364;282;Tim Robbins' direction is spot on.
I:21364;283;But please don'tinsult us by trying.
I:21364;284;That aside, Sarandon and Penn both performed well, although the characters situations lend themselves to heavy drama, presumeably any good actors forte.
I:21364;285;This film is a must see.
I:21364;286;Consequently every viewer of the film gets the chance to change his opinion about the death penalty.
I:21364;287;Besides the great performances by Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon the film is worth seeing because it gives you the opportunity to see the matter capital punishment with other eyes.
I:21364;288;What I liked the most about Dead Man Walking is the fact that it shows the issue from the death row inmate`s view.
I:21364;289;it is very emotional, especially the executionscene.
I:21364;290;Sarandon won an Oscar, but for me, Penn turned in the better performance.
I:21364;291;Definitely a movie to absorb and then sort out in your mind later.
I:21364;292;I highly recommend everyone to watch this film.
I:21364;293;if you really and truly understand this film and get in depth and touch with it, its a real drama people.
I:21364;294;filled with performances that will make you cry.
I:21364;295;i certainly cryed at the end when Sean Penn's character died.
I:21364;296;its just one of those movies that really gets in you after the final frame I guess.
I:21364;297;Director Tim Robbins wisely shows both sides of this long fought controversy.
I:21364;298;Penn is marvelous in his role as Matthew Poncelet, an embittered, hard young man whose time on death row has yet to prepare him for his road to redemption.
I:21364;299;Susan Sarandon gives an Oscar worthy performance as Sister Helen Prejean, a nun who finds herself becoming Penn's spiritual advisor as the time for his execution draws near.
I:21364;300;Sarandon is brilliant as she fights her internal demons, wanting to bring Penn his redemption, but wanting to console the families of the victims as well.
I:21364;301;Tim Robbins does a fantastic job directing this film.
I:21364;302;also Susan Sarandon does a great job.
I:21364;303;Her compassionate nature makes her visit the man.
I:21364;304;She realizes that to understand Matthew, she needs to understand the crime.
I:21364;305;These are very effective scenes.
I:21364;306;in the end, Matthew comes to term with his fate and Sister brings him together with his family.
I:21364;307;tim Robbins once again proves that he knows how to direct a film.
I:21364;308;This film is definitely an actors' film.
I:21364;309;Sean Penn finally starts to show what he is capable of and receives his first Oscar nomination.
I:21364;310;But it is Robbins' casting of the supporting players that makes the film great.
I:21364;311;Stage star Roberta Maxwell is compelling as Poncellete's mother.
I:21364;312;While Celia Weston was best know for her TV role on Alice, proves that she can manipulate an audience as on the victim's mother.
I:21364;313;And look for Jack Black in a very subdued performance .
I:21364;314;this is definitely an anti.
I:21364;315;It's a rare glimpse of how violence affects us all.
I:21364;316;Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn both give powerful performances.
I:21364;317;It's really an unforgettable movie.
I:21364;318;Not only is Robbins script and direction sterling, but both Penn and Sarandon are flawless in their portrayals or a true story.
I:21364;319;Sharp, smart, and never once does this film pander.
I:21364;320;or as the trailer puts it: about looking into the eyes of a killer and finding the heart of a man.
I:21364;321;Susan Sarandon, a nun, comes to meet with him and her eyes are opened up as the days tick down towards his scheduled execution.
I:21364;322;She also meets the people who are involved in the process, those who oppose the punishment, and those who favor it, like the victims' families.
I:21364;323;This powerful film can serve as a teaching tool about capital punishment and it can be enjoyed and talked about within the privacy of one's home.
I:21364;324;or it can just be enjoyed.
I:21364;325;Both Sarandon and Penn give terrific performances as they spend almost the entire film sperated by bulletproof barriers inside the prison.
I:21364;326;So go and get this film to keep around for your viewing pleasure.
I:21364;327;It would have been truly interesting and I am sure also life affirming to listen to her experiences in those dark days back then.
I:21364;328;But Tim Robbins film is a powerfully moving experience that tells a very painful but gloriously touching recounting of what happened during those depressing, dark and freightening days she spent with Poncelet on death row.
I:21364;329;She her self had never been involved in something so hopelessly dark and painful, but she was used in a wonderful way to help bring peace to the convicted killer and the families who suffered the loss of loved ones at his hands.
I:21364;330;Sean Pean and Susan Sarrandon give astonishing heartfelt performances that are rarely seen in cinema.
I:21364;331;The end result is a truly memorable film that becomes more and more intense and dramatic as it goes.
I:21364;332;This is one of the 10 best films of the entire decade of the 90s.
I:21364;333;I believe that this movie is one of the most honest, graphic and thorough commentaries on the death penalty that I have ever seen or read about.
I:21364;334;Prejean, a loving, empathetic, and helpful woman is inspiring and amazing.
I:21364;335;The acting is phenomenal (in both lead and supporting roles as well"
336;nobody Jack Black as Poncelet's brother), the script is impressively simple, yet complex, and this movie is brilliant.
337;A bit slow moving at times, it's all worth it in the end.
338;Definitely a movie to be watched with a full box of tissue.
339;Have been looking for it forever an was happy to fine it on here.
340;"In a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list
I:21364;341;And it is what this film is actually all about: Forgiveness.
I:21364;342;but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life.
I:21364;343;director/screenwriter Tim Robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death.
I:21364;344;As chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death.
I:21364;345;And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience.
I:21364;346;Through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well.
I:21364;347;stirring, impassioned portrayal of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress.
I:21364;348;Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of Poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began).
I:21364;349;Whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, Sister Prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here"
350;It's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career.
351;It makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things.
352;And that's the strength of Penn's performance.
353;"it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance
I:21364;354;A terrific performance, and .
I:21364;355;as good as Cage was in """"Vegas""""."""
356;Penn should have received the Oscar for it.
357;Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.
358;"provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what Robbins has accomplished with ""Dead Man Walking."""
359;Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness.
360;"And it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish
I:21364;361;As a teacher of high school seniors and juniors I use this film as part of out Capital Punishment unit.
I:21364;362;This film explores all perspectives.
I:21364;363;sarandon and Penn won their deserved accolades but the true winner here is the story for showing us the harrowing realities of executions.
I:21364;364;The dialogue is subtly witty and has interesting takes on big issues.
I:21364;365;An educated nun with an open mind.
I:21364;366;It may not be for everyone, but it has its heart and head in the right place.
I:21364;367;DEAD MAN WALKING is an excellent movie.
I:21364;368;Both Sarandon and Penn give tremendous performance.
I:21364;369;wrenching detail Sister Prejean includes in her story in omitted.
I:21364;370;She was full of hope and life.
I:21364;371;Starring Sean Penn in a bravura performance as a murderer getting ready for his execution, it takes a surprisingly Catholic point of view, in which Susan Sarandon plays a nun who makes him take responsibility for his actions, ostensibly to save his soul.
I:21364;372;This film is a good example of how much talent Robbins has and how, when he avoids major Left wing politics, he produyces some real genius.
I:21364;373;This is an excellent movie.
I:21364;374;A true story with a beautiful juxtaposition between killing as a crime and killing as a method of punishment by the state.
I:21364;375;The ending scene is powerful.
I:21364;376;Whether your opinion is changed or not"
377;That this movie stars two of my absolute favorite actors (one of whom has yet to receive the Oscar he deserves) and that it touches on a subject that I have strong feeling about (against the death penalty) would have been enough to get me in the theater to see it.
378;That the movie gives and honest portrayal of the pain and suffering of the victims' families gets glossed over.
379;The character's are all fully human in their portrayal, when it would have been easy to paint any of them as monsters or two.
380;regardless, it's just a good movie.
381;It is, as she will soon learn, a story that anti.
382;"but it does not end there, as she soon finds out
I:21364;383;And their portrayal is this movie's other great strength: without either of them, this film would not have been half as compelling.
I:21364;384;Both Sarandon and Penn deliver Academy Award.
I:21364;385;(""""I like that,"""" he comments when she quotes Jesus's """"the truth shall make you free."""""""
386;watching the movie is how deeply religious the film is.
387;But at the end of the day comes down solidly on the power of forgiveness and necessity of coming to terms with sins against us for peace of mind in our own lives.
388;Yes, you're right definitely Sean Penn should've had an oscar to his name.
389;Susan Sarandon is simply brilliant, it just makes you cry at the end.
390;The way she holds out her hand at the time of execution, the way she looks at Matthew (Penn), are all simply brilliant.
391;I thought this was a great movie when I had seen it in the theaters when it first came out but after having seen it again on video I have to say this movie now replaces Goodfellas as my favorite movie of all time.
392;Susan Sarandon was an easy choice for best actress and Sean Penn should have won best actor .
393;he is as good as there is in this type of role.
394;The entire supporting cast was brilliant as well, so much so that you'll sometimes forget you're actually watching a movie and not a documentary.
395;Great, perfectly fitting music by Bruce Springsteen.
396;This movie can make you laugh and cry at the same time.
397;It was also nice that a major motion picture finally portrayed a religious figure (a nun) in a positive light.
398;An exceptionally well done human interest story that has you talking about it long after you've turned it off.
399;Sean Penn shows us why he is the consummate actor of our time and the best years of his career are ahead of him as a leading character actor.
400;Academy Award Winning Actress Susan Sarandon delivers as always and this movie goes to elevate her standing as one of the great ladies of the cinema.
401;she is the bette Davis of our generation and she has gracefully transcended into the role of mature leading lady.
402;Savor this movie, because as time goes on and movies become big screen adaptations of Video games, and those who star in them have no greater depth than a plastic action figure, character driven movies with compelling real life drama will go the way of the dinosaur.
403;I regretted having delayed to see this movie.
404;The movie depicts her compassionate journey with him to the end.
405;The powerfully simple script without any dramatic twists and the compelling characters brillaintly acted out by Oscar winner Susan Sarandon along with Sean Penn, make this a memorable movie of all time.
406;The penetrating message about the capital punishment continues to be relevant to our society.
407;Dead Man Walking is that kind of rare.
408;susan Sarandon, portraying Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn, portraying the killer rapist whose spiritual guidance she takes into her hands, both give truly remarkable performances in this award.
409;winning movie based on fact.
410;Penn is utterly convincing in his role, bringing to the screen the damaged ugliness of a murderer's evil heart, as well as his final moments of anguish that finally allow real feeling to surface.
411;"Sarandon won an Oscar for her performance
I:21364;412;Dead Man Walking masterfully shows all sides of a many.
I:21364;413;On whatever side, or no side, the viewer's opinion falls, the movie is no less powerful from any perspective.
