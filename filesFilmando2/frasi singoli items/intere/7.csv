1;"If you want to see Morgan Freeman in a good role, see ""Dreamcatcher""."
2;That is an epic film.
3;The story is absolutely phenomenal, and the ending is one of the best I have ever seen.
4;It is worth viewing more than once
5;The Shawshank Redemption is often hailed as one of the best movies of all time.
6;While I haven't watched all movies of all time, I can honestly say it is one of the best I've ever watched.
7;a great cast of characters bring a great story to life.
8;This movie is so good.
9;I highly recommend it for everybody's classic collection.
10;It is a great story and the acting is top notch.
11;Awesome Price , Breath taking steelbook , Just go for it without hesitation it is fantastic .
12;One of the best films I've ever seen.
13;I so enjoyed this movie that I obtained the original novel and found that while there are some changes to the story they are relatively minor and do not detract from the theme of the story.
14;In my review I will compare the book to the film.1.
15;In the book Andy's poster at the time of his departure is one of Linda Ronstadt.
16;In the movie Red is black being portrayed by Morgan Freeman, and the character Red indicates that he is Irish.
17;Both these acts occur in the move.
18;There is a reason that it is ranked so high in IMDB's ranking chart.
19;just a bit of trivia for Stephen King fans.
20;This movie is an instant classic, an amazing story with flawless performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
21;One review below said they laughed through the whole movie.
22;If you prefer a thoughtful, well.
23;written story, this movie is for you.
24;I have watch this movie at least ten times and it's always fantastic.
25;Besides being an awesome, feel good movie the acting is superb!
26;I have so much more respect in Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman after this movie.
27;Perfect scores are just that: perfection.
28;I feel that this movie is indeed perfect.
29;Deep characters, an excellent storyline, believable situations, you name it.
30;the movie draws you in and holds you there.
31;elusive place of causing you to forget that you're in the real world.
32;set aside plenty of time to watch this masterpiece so you can enjoy it uninterrupted and prepare to stand in awe of filmmaking as an art.
33;The drama and role play of each character added to a fantastic conclusion is a must see for all to witness.
34;I loved it on blu ray.
35;This movie doesn't need a behind the scenes epilogue, you'll be able to get the clear and beautiful message that was intended just from watching the movie.
36;This movie tugs at your very soul .
37;the stark prison setting only dramatizes the real message of the movie: faith, friendship, and to decide whether to 'get busy living or get busy dying'.
38;Each character was fully developed and realistic.
39;It gives the viewer a good glimpse at what prison life might be like for inmates.
40;Morgan Freedman, especially as a narrator, was fantastic.
41;I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie with a good plot that keeps the viewer tied to the screen till the final scene(which was directed perfectly, by the way).
42;This movie really delivers in every catagory.
43;The plot and script are both great, adapted by a story from Stephen King.
44;The characters are all well portrayed, and after watching the movie we feel like we have gotten to know them.
45;Simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.
46;I can watch this movie a hundred times and still marvel at Tim Robbins character.
47;His portrayal of a man who would not loose his humanity or his hope in light of the travesties of prison life is legendary.
48;Morgan Freeman deserved an Oscar for his work in the film as well.
49;This movie is truely a work of art.
50;It's one of my favorite movies, the all.
51;time 'guy movie' (but all genders should love it), a show of friendship, loyalty, love of freedom and, above all, love of life in freedom.
52;cover style, the disk attached to the inner side of the back cover.
53;If you open the book, carefully, you will find glossy, beautifully illustrated pages dedicated to the many great actors that played in Shawshank, to Stephen King, of course, the director, the writer.
54;It also doesn't open very well so, like I said, open it carefully.
55;The other two extras feature Stephen King, the script writer, the director, the actors, the town where the movie was shot, the 'Shawshank Prison' building (a former real prison in real life), even former 'true' prisoners, talking about how it really was.
56;an alternative sound track with director's commentary is also available.
57;My favorite movie of all time.
58;Watch and you will see why.
59;The acting was just phenomenal.
60;I've watched this film umpteen times now and never tire of it's wonderful composition.
61;"Everything about it is just enchanting
I:8414;62;it's a film that truely moves you and offers amongst the most compelling viewing I've ever experienced.
I:8414;63;Shawshank Redemption belongs to an endangered species, the """"real movies"""" family."""
64;Characters as opposed to types (like the stone.
65;maker, always successful, and who, in the process, ends up with a sexy girl stuck to his prominent pectorals).
66;It satiates the hungry mind, and it's a balsam for the soul!
67;Well, months later I was talking to a friend and he mentioned how amazing it was.
68;I rate it as the best movie I have ever seen.
69;I recommend it to everyone I come across and to this day not one person has said they were disappointed with it.
70;I think I've seen this movie on the order of 20 times and each scene still fills me with excitement and emotion.
71;This, for me, is almost a perfect movie.
72;I'm a pretty picky movie.
73;It's a prison movie, yet it's more about freedom than anything.
74;freedom of both mind and body.
75;I'd like to think they were singing about something so beautiful it can't expressed in words, and it makes your heart ache because of it.
76;And everytime I see this movie it makes be cry a bit, laugh a bit, and most of all be thankful for my everyday freedom.
77;This is a great movie about friendship and overcoming adversity.
78;Very heart warming and inspirational.
79;I would definitely recommend it if you haven't seen it.
80;This movie is one of the classics already.
81;Tim Robbins gives such a gentle performance and Morgan Freeman is just flawless.
82;Let me begin by saying I believe this to be the greatest movie ever made in the history or movie making.
83;I've read the book and this movie stays very true to it.
84;And I plan to watch it even more.
85;Throughout his explanation, we see his words transformed into scenes depicting his time prior to the murder and what he says actually happened.
86;"He learns that Red is the ""go to"" for smuggling in such items, so he introduces himself."
87;He and Red quickly form a friendship and so sets the stage for the rest of the movie.
88;During this time Tommy learns of Andy's past and reveals something he's learned during his stay's at various prisons in his lifetime.
89;It is, in my opinion, the greatest ending ever!
90;The best thing about the movie is not only does it have the perfect ending, but it actually explains how the ending is accomplished.
91;So, if you get the chance to read the book, you should definitely do so!
92;An incredible, compelling story with superb acting.
93;Stephen King's story ( Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption ) is good .
94;This is the most devastatingly beautiful picture I have ever seen I just watched it for the first time and was compelled to see how and if others were as affected as I was.
95;The most powerful movie I have ever watched.
96;This is the start of the film but it's basically a catalyst for changing the lead characters life as well as a few others.
97;Eventually the warden learns that Andy has special financial talents that can be put to use by means that are legal and otherwise.
98;a twist of fate will cause Andy to get so close to a new trial and the possibility of freedom and redemption that he can taste it.
99;But hope is never completely lost, and the man who perseveres can triumph over great adversity.
100;there is a happy ending, but don't believe for a second that this is a happy film.
101;the soundtrack is a great bit of music and could stand alone, but works even better within the movie.
102;An extremely well crafted movie with all kinds of life lessons.
103;The story of an accussed man and his plight through Shawshank prison hits deep.
104;Its actually bordering on a masterpiece of filmwork.
105;I look foward to the blissful moments that give hope and make you watch .
106;Sign up for the notification of release, you'll feel better.
107;This film definitely deserves your viewing.
108;This is in the top 5 films I have ever seen.
109;The moment when Tim Robbins plays the opera over the loud speakers is very moving.
110;Since I was young this has been one of my favorite movies.
111;this movie is the greatest thing to hit the big screen ever.
112;morgan Freeman gives his best performance of his life in this classic movie.
113;this movie has everything Great cast,Great acting,Great writting,and Great Directing.
114;i give it a 5/5 rate.
115;For once, the IMDB top 250 is pretty close to the truth!
116;The movie has a terrific screenplay, to begin with.
117;I have always thought of this scene as one of the most moving in the movie, together with the harrowing lives of those who come out after 40 or 50 years of imprisonment.
118;In addition to all that, Frank Darabont's direction is masterful.
119;"I honestly envy everybody who watches this movie for a first time without knowing any details of the story
I:8414;120;To take but one example: the discovery of Andy's escape and the explanation of it, with the retrospect shots, the consequences and Red's narrative, is well.
I:8414;121;having mentioned Andy and Red, need I add that the cast is outstanding?
I:8414;122;And it is he who delivers many of the most haunting lines here, such as his great (and so true!)
I:8414;123;Few actors have the ability of Morgan Freeman to make the best of their lines without in the least exaggerating.
I:8414;124;The supporting cast is equally perfect.
I:8414;125;''The Shawshank Redemption'' remains one of the most powerful tributes to human spirit ever made for the screen.
I:8414;126;Everybody MUST see this gem at least once.
I:8414;127;It is an incredibly inspiring movie, a movie that gives me hope (yes, the best of things!)
I:8414;128;in human nature like few other works of art, let alone personal experiences, do.
I:8414;129;What better way to finish than one memorable quote from Red's ''institutionalized speech'':''These walls are funny.
I:8414;130;This is the greatest movie ever.
I:8414;131;This movie was by far one of the best movies I have watched in a very long time!!!
I:8414;132;And I watch many movies.
I:8414;133;This movie is a very heart warming story about two men and how one never gives up hope and the other begins to learn hope and gets a second shot at life.
I:8414;134;Great movie I was not expecting for it to be so good.
I:8414;135;A bit sad in a way but very uplifting at the end.
I:8414;136;it give new meaning to the word hope.
I:8414;137;It will be a golden classic .
I:8414;138;One of my favorite movies of all time!
I:8414;139;It is a great story and the two main characters do a fantastic job.
I:8414;140;Just one very excellent movie.
I:8414;141;One of the best of all time.
I:8414;142;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a great job sending the viewer into a dark world.
I:8414;143;I recommend reading the book before seeing this.
I:8414;144;This is one of the few times the book and movie are close to par.
I:8414;145;I added it at $27 and later bought it for $8.
I:8414;146;I love who plays in it.
I:8414;147;So much good stuff, so many life lessons.
I:8414;148;The heroes got their rewards, the villains got their proper punishments, and it ends on such a positive note.
I:8414;149;I watch this movie over and over and find something new each time.
I:8414;150;Better to watch the video version and not the TV version which cuts so much of the 'curse words' in the dialog.
I:8414;151;Now to the movie review:This is a very, very, very good movie.
I:8414;152;Overall the movie is based on a simple premise: hope.
I:8414;153;The acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is phenomenal.
I:8414;154;Their chemistry on the screen seems effortless.
I:8414;155;The storyline is well done and is written based on a novel by Stephen King (who knew?!)
I:8414;156;This is one of those movies you willingly watch over and over again, on purpose.
I:8414;157;It's a darn good movie.
I:8414;158;This is the best movie ever especially if you have been incarcerated before because it is real and raw when it comes to the need of hope in prison and becoming institutionalized.
I:8414;159;Though this is one of the longer types of movies, it is definitely one worth watching (like so many of the great ones are!)
I:8414;160;The greatest film of all time.
I:8414;161;This movie is a """"prison"""" movie, but also much more."""
162;If you've never seen it, take a chance.
163;This movie is great, one of those you need to watch a few times to get the little clues and has one of those unexpected endings.
164;mates who you should definitely never put your back to, this film is head and shoulders above every other prison movie I have ever seen.
165;The reason this film is ALWAYS quoted on the 10 ten best movies ever made is the sheer humanity of it.
166;Back in 1993 or '94 when this movie came out , a very good friend of mine told me I NEEDED to see it.
167;At that time he was one of the few people who had ever seen the movie (as it was not a hit in theatrical release),I waited to see it until it came out on VHS.
168;I have loved it ever since.
169;Every time I watch the movie it amazes me.
170;the true beauty of the story lies in the fact that even in a place of gloom and despair people can change their lives.
171;He changes because of his relationship with Andy.
172;Even though Andy was innocent and obviously did not deserve to be or want to be in prison, without him going Red's life may never have changed!Great movie, great message, GREAT actors!
173;Everyone who has seen this movie knows it deserves 5 stars!
174;It is an experience that I feel everyone should see.
175;everyone has given is perfect reviews!
176;go out and get yourself a copy, sit back, and enjoy!
177;I find it to be very encouraging!!!
178;This is just an all around great movie.
179;I absolutely love this movie and I am not a prison movie fan bynature, but this one is riveting.
180;I saw this one in the theaters years ago, and loved it.
181;This is one of those movies that I watch every time I come across it.
182;Can't NOT watch it and it's as good every time.
183;Even my 13 year old loves this movie.
184;I thought it was one of those movies that keep you on your feet.
185;It was really done well for all those people that played in this movie.
186;Even the Directors very well done.
187;The way the plot is worked and the characters are portrayed really impressed me.
188;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did an award winning job.
189;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman forge a lifelong friendship and Tim Robbins accomplishes amazing things while incarcerated.
190;Yes, it does take place in prison, so it does have some sadness to it, but overall, it IS a feel good movie.
191;One is a generic feel good film wrapped in saccharine clich s and the other, this one, is a magnificent character study that slowly yet poignantly captures the very essence of life.
192;Not only is he built for survival, but his presence ultimately helps the other inmates survive as well.
193;The film focuses on Andy and fellow inmate Red as they build a friendship that will last them forever, each of them learning from and teaching each other about life and what you make of it.
194;Red has been in prison a time now and has a lot to teach Andy about life within the prison walls, but in the end it is Andy's lessons of hope that bring a new light to Red's eyes.
195;It's hard when a film is this astonishing, for how can you really critique it, and no one wants to read redundant praising that lasts paragraph after paragraph.
196;i will praise it though, and hopefully these praises don't find themselves repetitious.
197;the first major selling point to this film is the script, which beautifully captures the genuine emotional state of the men involved.
198;Every single emotion bubbles to the surface and captivates the audience.
199;From a technical standpoint, this film is superb.
200;The camera angles and close framed cinematography is stunning and helps capture each of the emotions the script so wonderfully fleshes out.
201;You audience can feel the restraint and claustrophobia that the characters feel emotionally, expounding upon the already deeply rooted emotional resonance.
202;"The score, the lighting, the mood, the direction
I:8414;203;Freeman is the perfect compliment to Robbins, cycling though Red's loyalty and admiration as well as his experienced emotional callousness.
I:8414;204;They are the perfect pair and in all honestly should have BOTH been nominated at the Academy Awards.
I:8414;205;the long list of supporting players is also exceptional, from Clancy Brown's diabolical Captain Hadley to the slew of inmates that inhabit Shawshank.
I:8414;206;William Sadler is memorable as Heywood, and James Whitmore is devastatingly real as Brooks.
I:8414;207;plot regarding his release is one of the most resounding moments in the film.
I:8414;208;His portrayal of the sinister Warden Norton is flawless.
I:8414;209;He creeps up on you slowly, tearing at your nerves, and when he finally comes out and nails Andy with the bluntest of threats you are utterly blown away.
I:8414;210;in the end I am ashamed that the Academy went for generic and happy over meaningful and moving.
I:8414;211;`The Shawshank Redemption' is not only the greatest film of 1994, but it is possibly one of the greatest films ever made.
I:8414;212;One is uplifted upon the closing frames, the fact that hope prevails further cemented into their souls.
I:8414;213;`The Shawshank Redemption' is the perfect example of a perfectly balanced film, one that slowly yet masterfully weaves a tail of humanity, starting with emotional death and ending with an abundance of life.
I:8414;214;but hoe prisoners treat each other.
I:8414;215;This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and it is plain to see why it won the nominations that it did.
I:8414;216;Being a Stephen King fan, I first read the novella upon which The Shawshank Redemption is based when I was 12 and immediately considered it my favorite King work.
I:8414;217;What amazed me is how Frank Darabont not only remained faithful to the book but made it his own and, more importantly, into one of the decade's most moving.
I:8414;218;There's great poetry in Morgan Freeman's voice and the last 15 minutes of the film absolutely reduced me to tears.
I:8414;219;The Shawshank Redemption is widely considered to be one of the greatest films in history, and that claim definitely is valid.
I:8414;220;The warden, Sam Norton (Bob Gunton) is a stern man of God who is a crook at heart"
221;He asks for a rock hammer so that he can continue his hobby of geology and he asks for a poster of Rita Hayworth in order to have something pretty to look at.
222;Andy and Red become friends, and soon Andy is fairly popular around the yard.
223;he cements his status as the favorite of both the guards and the prisoners when he gives valuable financial advice to Hadley in exchange for getting some beers for his friends.
224;in addition to the story, the movie has great themes and observations.
225;The ideas of hope and fear are expertly dealt with in the film.
226;for a movie about prison life, The Shawshank Redemption is surprisingly uplifting.
227;It has numerous moments of intense violence and hatred, but overall, it is a story about hope and the goodness that can exist even in the hardest of convicts.
228;This movie should definitely be on every person's list of movies to see in their lifetime.
229;One the best shows I've ever seen.
230;I envy those of you who will experience the magic and power of Shawshank for the first time.
231;simply put, this is the greatest movie of all time.
232;A wonderful drama about finding hope where one least expects to find it.
233;Also, one of the most unexpected and fantastic endings of any film.
234;If you appreciate good drama, and great acting, I highly recommend this film!
235;the acting is this movie is excellent!
236;The movie takes the viewer on a wild ride of emotions .
237;mostly sadness and compassion, but in the end is very uplifting and positive movie.
238;i highly reccomend it to everyone!
239;this is in my top three favorite movies of all time.
240;The fact that he is actually innocent is the whole tamale.
241;The viewer is that much more excited that an innocent man busted out and made good.
242;Robbins' stunning work in Shawshank gives him the absolute right to pursue projects like Cradle.
243;Keep those creative juices flowing.
244;Tim Robbins does a very believable and effective job in this film, as does Morgan Freeman, as the con long denied parole who finds that being brutally honest can be a good thing.
245;Not recommended for younger viewers, as there are several disturbing parts, but a great film for mature viewers.
246;The greatest movie ever made.
247;I have watched this at least a dozen times and will keep watching it for the rest of my life.
248;I hope Andy is down there.
249;I hope to meet my friend and shake his hand.
250;"I hope""Highlight: The ending scene."
251;A movie about friendship and hope in dire circumstances.
252;ray edition with nice extras.
253;one of the most amazing movies i have seen.
254;If you havent see it you MUST.
255;such a leasson of life and hope
256;I am not typically a Tim Robbins fan, but he delivers a great performance in this movie.
257;Alongside of Morgan Freeman one of our greatest actors of the last twenty years, they do what I can only imagine is a terrific job of depicting what prison life was like in the era that the movie is set in
258;Go it fast in the mail.
259;Will love to do business with these guys again!
260;It's also an AWESOME movie.
261;It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again.
262;This movie is based on the book by the great author Stephen King.
263;One of the best movies out there.
264;truly a classic and so very well done.
265;Totally worth seeing more than once!
266;Well, 20 years, 40 years, 100 years from now, people will still be saying that, and they'll be using this movie as a reference point.
267;Without question, one of the greatest movies ever made.
268;A modern masterpiece that will stand the test of time.
269;This is my favorite film, and over the years I have watched it grow from a near box office flop to one of the most beloved films.
270;Through the course of actions, Andy begins to accept he is in prison and makes the best of it.
271;The film is a roller coaster of emotions, some comical, some tragic, and in the end total redemption.
272;I have seen it many times and still come close to tears at points.
273;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman create wonderful characters and should have both won Oscars.
274;Since this films release it has moved to number 2 on the IMDB.
275;If you want a prison film, this is one of the best.
276;Subtly beautiful without a doubt, great story, great acting.
277;"Morgan Freeman is also very good as Andy Dufrense's friend and fellow cell mate ""Red"" Redding."
278;Morgan also lends his voice as the movie's narrator.
279;Both actors are at their peak and deliver a great performance in the movie.
280;It is a story about redemption and hope against incredible odds.
281;This movie created all the passion for prison shows we have today.
282;This movie is without a doubt one of the best you will EVER see.
283;He befriends Ellis Red Redding (also brilliantly played by Morgan Freeman) and the two begin a long and poignant friendship.
284;"But Andy has a secret that we don't discover until well into the film
I:8414;285;This secret leads to many twists and turns and finally to the shocking and inspiring ending of the movie.
I:8414;286;of particular note, is the superb performance of Bob Gunton who plays prison warden Samuel Norton.
I:8414;287;He does some of the best acting in a supporting role that has EVER been done by ANY actor.
I:8414;288;this film showcases the indomitability of man's spirit as well as the farther reaches of his courage.
I:8414;289;This is a must see and one you will want to see again and again.
I:8414;290;adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes (two sure.
I:8414;291;Because every single scene is an essential element that contributes to the final result: a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made.
I:8414;292;Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience.
I:8414;293;This movie is purely one of the best I have ever seen.
I:8414;294;Plain and simple a must see movie with a fantastic storyline and life learning lessons that will stick with you forever.
I:8414;295;Not many movies will capture your heart and soul like this one.
I:8414;296;Wonderful performances, writing, editing and scenery come together to create one of the best dramas ever put on film.
I:8414;297;If you see one prison movie in your life make it this one.

324;With the amazing plot and props help you experience what being in prison would feel like.
325;With excellent timing of 2 hrs.
326;and 22 min., the story seems to express a total of 20 years in great detail.
327;Both themes of redemption and friendship show greatly throughout the movie.
328;Shawshank Redemption is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.
329;andy Dufresne, a very clever and mild mannered New England Banker, is convicted of murdering his wife and her secret lover and is sent to jail.
330;Andy slowly creates a friendship with Red, known for his ability to smuggle things in to the jail, and his gang.
331;Later, Andy also forms a friendship with the guards by assisting them with financial help and is rewarded with protection from the rougher convicts.
332;His smarts and confidence keep him going and he is able to teach the other prisoners that hope is the ultimate mean of survival.
333;Instead when you use your brain, and strive to do the best that you can, you will almost always win.
334;Feeling that Shawshank Redemption's rating of R for language and prison violence is not a fair rating and therefore I recommend it to all people 13 and older.
335;I recommend this movie not only to people who like dramas, but to people who love comedies, action, inspiring movies, and all others because no matter what type of movies you like, you'll love Shawshank Redemption.
336;One of the best movies I have seen ever.
337;The double disc (making of movie) was great as well
338;This is a wonderful movie and one of the best climaxes I have ever seen in a movie.
339;Oh, give that guy an Oscar.
340;I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.
341;Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.
342;And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.
343;It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.
344;this is my favorite movie of all time.
345;it truly is an amazing story that captures and keeps your attention throughout.
346;it is truly a masterpiece.
347;Received movie in timely manner.
348;Product received in excellant condition.
349;Packaged well to keep it from getting damaged in transit.
350;Its one of my favorite movies to watch.
351;This is a wonderful story for all people to see.
352;During this movie you will experience alot of emotions.
353;This is a movie that will pull you on your heart stings.
354;I highly recommended this move to everyone.
355;This has to be among the five best movies ever made.
356;One of the best movies out there.
357;Morgan Freeman is just terrific and this was one of his best.
358;He has a delivery system set up through the laundry delivery.
359;He helps several prisoners learn to read, and to take the GED test for a high school diploma.
360;Ah, that's the meat of the story, and for that you must see the film.
361;Believe me, it is worth it.
362;This is one of the most loved films in recent years.
363;Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman are very good in it and it is well directed.
364;pace is a little slow in places but on the whole, an admirable piece of work.
365;When I read the book by Steven King, I thought that it was very good.
366;The script was good, but the best part by far was the acting.
367;Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) head up a terrific cast in this thrilling drama about life inside the walls of Shawshank Prision.
368;This movie keeps you guessing.
369;I love how they never tell you why Red is in there, makes you wonder.
370;This turned out to be a really great assignment.
371;I have to say this is one of the better movies I have seen.
372;This movie was an inspiration.
373;Wrongfully convicted he had the perseverance to create the biggest library for a prison at that time.
374;I recommend this to anyone who likes murder mystery and anything dealing with prison breakouts.
375;the final 30 minutes of film were totally worth it.
376;His presence can only increase the amount of enjoyment you get from a movie.
377;A calm character he is, one who always comes across as patient and someone you want to listen to for advice.
378;Excellent performances by Tim Robbins, Morgon Freeman and Bob Gunton, as the evil Warden Norton.
379;This depicts a triumph of human ingenuity and spirit over an evil, repressive prison confinment.
380;Forrest Gump is a good movie but nowhere to compare to this.
381;This also have to be the best Stephen King movie ever.
382;Without a doubt, probably the best prison film of all time.
383;He is found guilty and sentenced to life in Shawshank prison.
384;They become best friends and go through a whole series of events together in prison.
385;The ending is the most moving part of the whole movie, what Morgan says at the end just makes you stop and think about life.
386;This is a truly moving movie.
387;Unfortunatley, though nominated for some Oscars like, Best Actor(Morgan Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.
388;this movie deserved the awards it got because it is soooo good, if you like this movie watch:Antwone FisherGirl InterruptedOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
389;So, I just want to put my 5 Stars on the board for one of the best movies of all time.
390;if you haven't seen this movie, why are you waiting?Get it, watch it and watch it more than once.
391;This movie is like an onion, lots and lots of layers.
392;If you have kids, definitely watch it with them.
393;This movie will give you lots of opportunities for useful discussion.
394;Heat it up and enjoy the abundant output of an incredibly gifted team of vertically integrated artists.
395;An absolutley fascinating film about a man who claims he is innocent and is sent to prison.
396;He meets a man named Red, and their adventures in this movie are like no other ever portrayed on film.
397;It goes from its captivating beginning and just keeps getting better and better.
398;The films happy ending is also a major upside along with the moment where the warden throws a rock at a poster revealing a large hole in the wall behind it.
399;There he meets Red played by Morgan freeman were they develop a long time friendship.
400;At first when red first sees him he thinks he is unfit for prison life but Robbins in a great role is clam and reserves his emotions and actions.
401;Although this is better than The Green Mile another King adaptation by Darabont which is also great.
402;Keep reading and you'll see my reasons.
403;i cannot praise the movie well enough, since it is one of my all time favorites.
404;Dufresne himself makes a difference in almost all the prisoner's lives, by showing that the cruelty of the prison cannot darken his will and spirit.
405;It is an inspiring movie, it's almost hard to believe that it is based on a Stephen King story.
406;Everything about the movie fits, the acting, the writing, and the entertainment.
407;It is an exceptional movie.
408;rate movies get the 2.
409;However the opportunity arose and I have great respect for the main actors including Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
410;I was surprised at how well acted this movie is.
411;Even the period costumes in the background music matched so well that you forgot you were watching the movie.
412;barring the twists and turns and subplots of this story is basically about two imprisoned men and how they bond over a number of years, surviving the many institutional foes.
413;If you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat.
414;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are supurb in this tale of hope.
415;Without a doubt you must see it.
416;This beautiful period prison drama features expert performances by a talented cast, mainly Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.
417;It is the story of hope and friendship in extreme circumstances, a movie about the undominable human spirit.
418;Great direction by Frank Darabont and attention to detail.
419;Extremely satisfying ending, both dramatically and story.
420;One of the best films of the decade.
421;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 9!
422;Wonderful actors, and captures emotion.
423;Some parts of the movie are so heart.
424;This movie is exceptional for its screenplay, the acting, and the storyline.
425;Each detail of the film is presented with care and sensitivity.
426;Even the musical background and selections throughout the film move the storyline along to the fantastic conclusion.
427;This was very economical and arrived in good time.
428;It's amazing to me how long it took him to escape and what he had to do to escape.
429;This wonderful picture goes on my all.
430;I have seen it countless times, and it still packs an emotional punch.
431;Master of macabre assembly line horrors finally made something she vastly enjoyed.
432;a lot of excitement lots of action.
433;Any time I ask someone what their favorite movie is, Shawshank Redemption always comes up in their top five.
434;This movie is nothing short of brilliant.
435;Every single role is perfectly portrayed by each actor, from the leads, with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, all the way down to the smallest supporting roles.
436;It reaches for greater heights of filmaking and even larger themes, such as patience(a theme rarely touched upon in cinema), hope, perseverence, sacrifice, true friendship, and resolve(get busy living or get busy dying).
437;This subtle touch helps add to the mystique of Robbins' character because we never really know who he is, or how he finds the quiet strength and hope deep down inside to keep him mentally apart from the horrifying prison life.
438;The story spans about 20.30 years, and we are submitted to a variety of plot turns, colorful characters, and most of all, the inescapable duration of time.
439;But on the grand scale, it is all simply setting the scene for one of the greatest endings EVER put on film.
440;I won't even give a hint as to what happens, but the last twenty minutes of this film are so good, you'll simply sit there in awe as the credits roll.
441;It is truly that good.
442;This movie is amazing, to say the least.
443;it was so clever and it is what sets this movie aside from the other prison movies.
444;I don't give many movies a perfect 5 but I would give this a perfect 10 if I could.
445;If there were ever a movie that has it all, its this one.
446;Great Story, Great actors, Great and believable plot.
447;The dialogue is also on par with some of the best movies I have ever seen.
448;this is one of the most beautifully done movies.
449;it has been a favorite for years.
450;if the price is right, add it to your collection.
451;This movie gives a fairly good take on prison life.
452;Andy's indomitable spirit brings him through his trials while in prison and leads the film to an incredible conclusion that will have you jumping up and down and running around the room.
453;what was initially billed as the film's greatest detriment, its length, actually turns out to be its greatest asset.
454;style editing and jump cuts, The Shawshank Redemption's deliberate pacing helps the audience truly bond with the characters and ultimately when the film's many strands come together for its conclusion, the emotional payoff is vastly more satisfying for the viewer.
455;This is by far my favorite movie of all time.
456;I was amazed how the movie masterfully pulls you in to the story of a man wrongly imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit.
457;Whoever cast this movie is a genius.
458;The movie was brutal, sad and touching, but leaves you with such hope.
459;The Shawshank Redemption is an awesome movie.
460;This movie sort of shows that a friend can really be something good to a person, because Red was a good friend to Andy and Andy seem to do fine and keep his sanity even in a prison.
461;Because of the warden's position, he gets to do whatever he wants with Andy because his position gives him the power.
462;The Shawshank Redemption is one the best films ever made by the hand of man in all history, and I just thank god that it finally found it's audience.
463;This is a film that should be viewed by EVERYONE!
464;You'll get it in a couple days or so, and when that package comes in the mail, you rip it open and pop that puppy in the VCR and prepare to be mesmerized by a true masterpiece.
465;The Shawshank Redemption touched me right down to my soul.
466;"Hope is a good thing

I:8414;469;This movie is so much more than that.
I:8414;470;It is a story of hope"
471;When all one has is hope.
472;The first is having the always outstanding Morgan Freeman eloquently narrate the story along the way.
473;It is a stroke of pure genius, and it adds so much to the movie.
474;It is amazing how much the music of a particular film can impact upon the total movie experience.
475;this is simply one of the best movies ever made, a movie you can watch time and time again.
476;I give it my highest recommendation possible.
477;I had seen this movie years ago but a second viewing was just as moving.
478;The resilience of the human spirit, under pressure, is inspiring.
479;This is a great story about one man's patience and ability to endure, and the deep friendship he makes along the way.
480;With tremendous performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins this movie is a work of art that leaves you warm inside.
481;Based on 80,000+ votes on IMDB this movie is rated second only to The Godfather, as the best movie of all time.
482;the special features are numerous and very well done.
483;with these language options, the vast majority of the planet can now enjoy this fantastic movie.
484;I have now watched this film about 6 times and each time I find another great plot point or nuance.
485;What can I say, this is a great classic movie, with the culprits being those who run the prision.
486;A classic well worth adding to your movie collection.
487;one of Tim Robbins best roles.
488;one of the few times you root for the prisoners in a movie.
489;It looks and sounds great.
490;You really feel those prison walls and the characters become more real.
491;I recommend this one for your permanent BD library.
492;And the ending is just beautiful.
493;this is simply a wonderful movie.
494;The plot is simple, but the music, acting, and filming are amazing.
495;I highly recommend this to everyone.
496;It is one of my all time favorites, and we've watched it multiple times.
497;this is a must see movie it is so real.
498;the way prison life for the inmates it is a great movie to see if you have some one in your life that is in prison you can see what it is like
499;Was watching 'Waters World' on O'Reilly and the subject was 'best movies.'
500;This came up as one of the greatest of all time.
501;It was a great movie.
502;Great acting by great actors.
503;Loved being surprised at the end.
504;This is a movie I'll watch again.
505;If you have not seen this movie yet you have got to see it.
506;The acting is top by all actors.
507;It just touches and pulls at your heart all through the movie.
508;This may be the best movie ever made.
509;It is such a good movie because it stayed true to the book.
510;I think it is the best movie I have ever seen.
511;Nobody cared to see it.
512;For those of you keeping score at home that's an average of $3.17 million a week.
513;It's a good movie, but not nearly a great one.
514;Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot.
515;here are some of the good things about this film:1.)
516;The dramatic arc is right on target and there are plot surprises.2.)
517;The pacing by the director is very good.
518;The suspenseful buildup is well timed and the scenes snap in place with good tempo and rhythm.
519;If you can get by the dry, aloof, and uninspired performance by Robbins, you will really like the acting job by Freeman.
520;This is a well rounded, three.
521;dimensional performance by Freeman and he really saves the film's credibility.4.)
522;The villain is believable and more importantly sinister.
523;It's well written and more importantly, played out realistically.5.)
524;The sound engineering is excellent.
525;A movie you either love OR hate.
526;but somehow, I found the middle ground and saw the gray lining.
527;It had it's share of rivals in Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, but I must say with complete humbleness, that this is one of the most underappreciated, underrated, and best films of the modern era of motion pictures.
528;the story written by the horror master, Stephen King, shapes a unique and compelling story with many surprise twists including an ending that shocks and completely catches you off guard.
529;It has everything: great story line, likable characters, a truly evil sinister antagonist, and surprise elements along the way.
530;the movie is so well crafted that you feel you are eavesdropping on the main characters all the time.
531;For example, when Red finds Andy's treasure and personal note at the end of the film, Red opens up an envelope with a huge amount of cash and looks around as if someone is eavesdropping on him.
532;It's a poignant yet funny moment that takes the edge off of his discover.
533;If you give it a chance you may believe in the hope and triumph of the human spirit.
534;love this movie like the story line and like to watch this movie and love to see this at any time without question
535;Some of the reviews written here, including Amazon.
536;com's editorial review hammer home how important this movie is: the poignant emotions it evokes in viewers, but in terms of how powerful using time in a film to create a real sense of experience can be.
537;If this movie is nostalgic for you, you'll enjoy seeing the stars reminisce about filming the movie, and what it meant to each of them.
538;I think this really solidifies the intense emotions this movie produces in viewers, and it definitely adds value to the film.
539;Sometimes it's hard to see the bigger picture.
540;Our journey in life builds our character.
541;It is interesting, thought provoking, and well put together.
542;winner Tim Robbins (Mystic River, The Hudsucker Proxy) stars in this Oscar.
543;This is one of my all time favorite movies I recieved it just as planned.
544;I believe that,like good friends, we can count the truly great movies on the fingers of our hands.
545;This picture is in my top 5 of all time.
546;The performances alone, of all the cast, not just Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, are superb.
547;This movie is the best movie ever made.
548;This blu ray is great because it came with a book about the movie which was very interesting and informative.
549;This is by far the best movie that I have ever seen and I think most would agree.
550;First of all the script is perfect.
551;"From there a friendship sparks with him and another inmate named ""Red""."
552;The movie is about his life and how he adapts to prison with a great ending.
553;Who can possibly deny that this movie should have won an Oscar for best picture in 1994?
554;This is by far among the greatest masterpeices in the history of film.
555;, this film moved me.
556;I experienced the gamut of emotions.
557;the characters were brilliant and alive, as well as the cinematography and music.
558;The original score, similar to those done by John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones), added to the suspense and energy.
559;The Shawshank Redemption is simply put, the most awe.
560;inspiring movie i have ever seen.
561;Morgan Freeman is outstanding as always, and puts on a great performance in this movie.
562;Tim Robbins, who plays Andy Dufresne, a man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, really makes the viewer gain a larger appreciation for their own life.
563;In the movie, Andy Dufresne always remains hopeful, which is the sole reason he survives in Shawshank prison.
564;The ending is spectacular, which is expected from the mind of Stephen King, the man who originally wrote the short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption .
565;Thios movie has changed my life forever, and hopefully,will do the same for many others.
566;Stephen King did an excellent job as always.
567;We love this movie and it is a great addition to our movie library which we have hundreds.
568;The story is moving and most rewarding.
569;This movie is just as great as it was when I was younger.
570;"There are very few movies that really deliver such an amazing story with such amazing performances
I:8414;571;We are always riveted when watching this movie.
I:8414;572;The filming and sets were done extremely well.
I:8414;573;Tim and Morgan gave excellent performances.
I:8414;574;This movie is by far the greatest movie ever .
I:8414;575;When I got the movie one side of the case has a very small scratch the movie is perfect:)
I:8414;576;good flick, but not until the very end.
I:8414;577;Shawshank redemption is a great movie I've seen several times.
I:8414;578;Just a great story about life in prison.
I:8414;579;Acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is excellent.
I:8414;580;The movie played perfectly with no issues.
I:8414;581;I used the live streaming and there were only a couple little lags, but overall it was as good as you can get.
I:8414;582;A great strory and great actiing.
I:8414;583;One of the best I have seen in a whiile.
I:8414;584;One of the best movies of all time!
I:8414;585;To feel that good after seeing a prison movie, is incredible.
I:8414;586;I totally enjoyed the journey to Shawshank.
I:8414;587;Some scenes that look the best are when Morgan Freeman in in the hay field in Buxton.
I:8414;588;The close ups of Red and Andy are crystal clear and every great character mark you can see.
I:8414;589;If you are not sure if you want to upgrade, let me just say it is well worth it.
I:8414;590;This movie just gets better and better with each viewing.
I:8414;591;If you have never seen this movie, you are in for a real treat.

I:8414;595;At the time of this writing, 549 people have reviewed this movie and it ranks 5 full stars.
I:8414;596;Because it is, hands down, the best movie I have ever seen.
I:8414;597;First off let me state this is my friends favorite all.
I:8414;598;O well to each his own.
I:8414;599;One of my all time favorites.
I:8414;600;Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship.
I:8414;601;The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance.
I:8414;602;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively.
I:8414;603;And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving.
I:8414;604;The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.
I:8414;605;As well as a very surprising """"twist"""" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair."""
606;As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.
607;The Shawshank Redemption is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever.
608;It is entertaining through and through and gives a glimpse of the lives of long term prisoners that many people will fortunately, never know.
609;first rate performances by all the actors, especially Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.
610;I still watch this movie at least once a year.
611;It's a great story with a great ending!
612;It's almost as good as the Godfather trilogy to me!
613;This is a great movie about hope and friendship and justice.
614;I've watched this time after time since it was released, and I always catch something new.
615;The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best and most underrated movies out there.
616;The extras/bonus features add to the experience.
617;My husband loves this movie.
618;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman create such believable characters and the horrifying realities of prison life hold the viewer captive.
619;The reasons it was rated R, I believe, are some of the themes may be considered graphic, but for the most part, they did not show them.
620;I watched this with my teenage boys, and they loved it.
621;Virtue regardless of circumstances, I believe, is the message that is very well said.
622;You also know that each role is exceptionally well.
623;If you just want to play the movie on demand, the VHS is fine.
624;I'd been meaning to see this forever, since so many people recommend it, and I'm so glad I finally watched it!
625;It is the great pay back movie.
626;Intelligent realistic and great actors also .
627;Great movie, one of my all.
628;Deep and moving portrayals by the actors.
629;Plus it has a great ending.
630;This is a masterpiece of film work and acting.
631;The story is phenomenal, and one of the best translations of a Stephen King work!
632;It is put together and directed so well, I can't fault it for anything.
633;Even after all these years I still find my self watching this movie from time to time, I am a big fan of documentaries about criminal investigation, court trials and prisons, and this in my opinion seems to be the best fictional movie about prison and incarceration ever made.
634;This movie is such a good, good wholesome movie.
635;Teaching friendship and THE BEST ending ever.
636;I watch it quite alot.
637;The Shawshank Redemption is by far, one of the greatest movies of all time.
638;It is ultimate story of how hope truly never dies, and how good things finally happen to good people.
639;tim Robbins, in his finest acting job to date, plays the wrongly convicted Andrew Dufresne.
640;He is sent to Shawshank Prison for killing his wife and her lover, and there he meets Red, played by the ever talented (and one of the best voice.
641;The chemistry between the two is so amazing throughout the entire movie, and you can clearly see it flow.You really begin to feel for Andy and his quiet demeanor peppered with subtle emotions.
642;Just when you think the movie is going a certain way, the plot takes an incredible turn that leaves you sitting there with your mouth open.
643;the film is wonderfully written, and the actors were superb.
644;It has a beautiful flow to it, and you can't help but enjoy the masterpiece that you are viewing.
645;You will definately be pleasantly satisfied.
646;This film is an excellent addition to anyone's video collection.
647;This is a great movie and when I saw the day after thanksgiving deal I had to get it, it is a must have for me.
648;Although Tim Robbins plays the character the events of the story revolve around, it is his effect on Morgan Freeman's narrating character that is the film's true focus, for it is the slow forming of that emotional bond that gives this beautifully made film its power.
649;I read the story by King first, then I saw this movie, and I must say , I love it.
650;It does the novella justice.
651;In one of the most inspiring films ever made, Tim Robbins (as Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (as Red) give their best performances and enthrall the audience emotionally.
652;He comes across Red, the seasoned prisoner and an improbable friendship springs up between them.
653;The excruciations and his unbendable hope make Andy stronger and determined, leading to freedom in his own way.
654;"and remember: Fear can hold you prisoner
I:8414;655;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8414;656;The movie is a quiet emotional ride of shock, understanding, hope, depression, and triumph.
I:8414;657;Even after all of these years I watch until the last frame and leave the movie with a smile.
I:8414;658;I would recommend anyone over the age of 18 to see this movie.
I:8414;659;A great talent and a great guy as comfortable to be around as an old shoe.
I:8414;660;You will love this movie , you'll never tire of it, you'll gift it to your friends (like I have done)and you'll be riveted from the very opening scene.
I:8414;661;This is a classic movie and a keeper 110%
I:8414;662;Ranks right up in the top 100.
I:8414;663;i didn't read the book but, Stephen King must once again be proud of his accomplishments.
I:8414;664;Like Delores Claiborne, this movie tugs at the heart in a beautiful way.
I:8414;665;I became interested when I saw reviews in Parade by some actors and actresses who chose Shawshank as the best film of the year.
I:8414;666;to the naysayers, well to each his own, but seven academy award nominations speaks volumes.
I:8414;667;Out of the thousands of movies I have seen this is still in the top 5 all time best movies.
I:8414;668;I would recommend this movie to everybody.
I:8414;669;Its definitely a cunning movie that i could watch over and over again.
I:8414;670;I'm not a fan of Stephen King movies and was unsure about watching this movie, but I did, and wow!It's not very often we get to see such a strong cast in such an amazing film these days, but this movie delivers in both accounts.
I:8414;671;this movie is so well done and I love the way it pans out towards the end.
I:8414;672;Stephen King has proven he can write good dramas with out having to throw in machanical killers and possessed thingys.
I:8414;673;it was largely ignored at the box office, but this has to be one of the best movies to come out in recent times.
I:8414;674;I got this for my daughter.
I:8414;675;We both watched it and liked it very much.
I:8414;676;Good movie as all fans know.
I:8414;677;a worthy piece of movie that you do not want to miss.
I:8414;678;One of the greatest stories on screen with wonderful acting.
I:8414;679;letter sentiment is exactly how I feel every time I watch """"Shawshank""""."""
680;, and that exact feeling of triumph resonates throughout the many satisfying special features on Disc 2.
681;But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell (especially when one is innocent) makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion.
682;Everyone is real, and everyone is flawed.
683;But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful, sublime, and moving things ever committed to celluloid.
684;A great story and a well chosen cast make this film a winner .
685;This move is really good , its long but not drawn out nor boring , it was one of those shows that make you go hummm
686;that said, Darabont does a wonderful job with his commentary.
687;This is a great movie.
688;To think this movie comes from a short story by Stephen King is kind of amazing.
689;This is easily Tim Robbins best role.
690;One of my all time favorite bittersweet, feel good about the human spirit and condition.
691;Some of the finest acting (and oratory skills from Freeman) you'll ever see, superb plot, screenplay, directing, etc.
692;Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors of our time and Tim Robbins shone as the good guy character.
693;well that's MY opinion, even if a bunch of critics didn't necessarily think so.
694;Just goes to show you.
695;My guess is those users favorite movie is something like The Cable Guy or Scary Movie.
696;In any case, this is my favorite movie.
697;shawshank if perfectly acted and directed.
698;I find myself mumbling and laughing to myself, drawing attention from others, while watching this movie.
699;I'm usually saying This is my favorite part.
700;The beer scene and ending are my real favorites though.
701;This is by far Stephen King's best movie and it is right up there with the 1994 Academy Award winning movie Forrest Gump.
702;Tim Robbins gives the performance of a lifetime.
703;The movie itself might not have been quite as good as Gump, but he definately had a better performance than Hanks (who as you know won best actor).
704;And Morgan Freeman is outstanding.
705;If you think that this movie is just mediocre, then watch this movie again, but watch it closely and pay attention!
706;well you'll have to watch it to find out what it's really about.
707;I bet you'll watch it more than once.
708;i highly recommend this movie for your collection.
709;This is one move we can watch over and over thank you
710;I highly recommend it to anybody who is a Shawshank fan.
711;"People say it's so great, but I'm always like, ""what's so great about it?"
712;And, I'm sorry, but Gene Wilder is great in that movie.
713;Here's the story: two criminals are in prison in the 1960s and they become friends while they're in jail.
714;done film about friendship and persistence.
715;I won't waste anyone's time retreading through the plot, but there are some wonderful touches.
716;best movies of all time !!!
717;great acting great directing great storyline it's grrrr reeeee aaaa tttt !!
718;The video wasn't great, but it was pretty good.
719;I give it a 7.5 to 8.0 on a 10 point scale.
720;I think this is a classic.
721;Great movie a little long but well worth the time.
722;Will always be a classic.
723;I really loved this movie for the acting/actors who played in it and the message it sends.
724;Honesty is the best polcy and the truth shall set you free, just pay attention to your inner guide and you'll always find a way out of any situation.
725;This movie was probably one of the best movie moments I've had.
726;(See THE USUAL SUSPECTS) for another movie that buzzes as masterpiece before it's release.
727;This movie is emotionally packed with all kinds of goods.
728;This is a truly great film, it really involves the viewer and tells a great story about an unjustly convicted man and his struggles in jail.
729;It's got a lot of very moving moments and has a very human story at the centre.
730;i'd recommend this to anyone as a must see film, and it has enough in it to make it worth watching several times.
731;Now it's a popular favorite that holds the No. 2 spot on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 movies.
732;It's just a good, old.
733;after that he was able to demand the right to direct it, and this is an excellent book.
734;burning, engrossing fuse for the first two hours, and the final act a series of beautifully timed storytelling explosions .
735;It probably will make some people upset because of this.
736;Every once in awhile, a film comes along that defies explanation, that you can't really pinpoint why everyone loves it so much, you just do.
737;Despite having rather brutal guards and gay men who keep assaulting him, Andy becomes very likable due to his intelligence.
738;He also befriends Red, a kind of convenience store man who can get anything.
739;This is my favorite movie of all time.
740;Freeman and Robbins made a great on screen dual male lead.
741;This movie is filled with realism and suspense.
742;King is an incredible story teller.
743;I have enjoy Kings work for many years but, this is really a deep story line.
744;Once in a while a film emerges that goes beyond the mainstream, though manages to touch many hearts and minds.
745;These films somehow give us hope, inspiration and a reason to carry on despite the obstacles thrown unremittingly across our paths.
746;They show us that the human being is capable of enduring great suffering yet can push through this suffering and shine like never before.
747;The Shawshank Redemption is one such film.
748;Andy is an unusual character.
749;He is a man of great intelligence and patience, a man with a basic goodness that shines forth despite the horrors that befall him.
750;He is a man of great humanity and never ever loses hope because he holds fast to those simple aspects in life that define our humanity.
751;Red (Morgan Freeman) comes to the conclusion that the act simply made him and his fellow prisoners feel more human.
752;morgan Freeman as Red narrates the story about Andy and their relationship with an almost undefinable heart.
753;"I truly believe Freeman is one of the best ""voice."
754;His resonate and wise voice pulls the viewer into the tale making the story feel real and significant.
755;Freeman makes us listen because what he's saying is true and we hold on to every word because we know we'll learn something.
756;Morgan Freeman is one of our greatest actors.
757;The soundtrack is beautiful, but it is Robbins and Freeman, including the entire cast, that makes this film an extraordinary one.
758;In this round, somehow, against all odds to the contrary, good triumphs over evil.
759;And it is done with such flair, elegance and real justice, that most of us coming away from the tale are left almost dumbfounded: how did Andy do it?These are good men in appalling conditions, where most would fall and become part of the evil.
760;the Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable film.
761;Shawshank is one of my favorites movies.
762;ray picture was simply amazing, perfect.
763;I see this movie at least 5 times in a year and I now own it and I am happy.
764;He plays a charismatic and vicious pimp.)
765;He was likeable, intelligent and sly.
766;Best of all, in my view, was Bob Gunton as the warden.
767;Four stars is generous, but the movie is better than three.
768;I am surprised every time I mention this beautiful film to a friend and find they have not seen nor heard of it.
769;No movie will leave you feeling so overwhelmingly satisfied as will The Shawshank Redemption.
770;I have yet to enjoy another movie as greatly and I have never felt nearly as drawn to the characters of a movie as I have while watching the Shawshank Redemption.
771;Many turns in this movie and some heart wrenching moments.

784;I love it, it's definetly one of my all.
785;This is truly one of the finest films ever made.
786;It is sweeping, heartbreaking and uplifting.
787;It has surpassed Star Wars as the movie I've viewed the most times.
788;The characters are a part of my imagination now.
789;I can see Andy and Red now on the shore of the Pacific.
790;This is the best movie ever made.
791;I have seen every movie on IMDBs top 100 and this film is amazing, it has something for everyone and if you are that weird extraterrestrial that doesnt like it for some reason then your broken and need to seek repairs because your alien robot brain is malfunctioning.
792;It came right when it said that it would and the product works just fine.
793;But what I will say is that this movie is a great movie, an awesome story, with good direction from the same man who directed The Green Mile (Frank Darabont).
794;The picture with this blu.
795;ray is very good, which is the largest thing your looking for on a blu.
796;ray, and the sound is also meets expectations.
797;This movie always keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart beating.
798;The moment Andy got into Shawshank, he wanted to get out.
799;"He created a strong enough relationship with Red, that he could get stuff ""smuggled"" to him from other guys in the prison."
800;Near the end of the movie Andy tells something to Red that changes the movie a little bit that makes the audience get on the edge of there seat.
801;They have created a certain pathos in the prisoners.
802;The warden also has created a pathos in the prisoners as well.
803;Its a cool movie that should only be seen by people High School and up.
804;This film should have received the Oscar in the year it was nominated and not Forrest Gump!
805;It's simply a wonderful story and it relates to everyone who's been in jail for a minor misdemeanor or for something thy didn't do.
806;great actors and good story for family and kids.
807;My husband and I have watched this movie numerous times and just loved it.
808;The Shawshank Redemption is by far one of the best movies made in the past decade.

811;I had to add this favorite movie to my collection.

813;After serving almost 20 years of his sentence Andy tunnels through the walls to freedom and lives his dream of living next to the Pacific Ocean.

I:8414;866;the connection that I felt between the characters were strong and powerful.
I:8414;867;The one thing this movie shows and talk about is hope, it reminds me of a video I made for my multimedia class back in high school.
I:8414;868;The video's message was about hope and contains a poem about it.
I:8414;869;i have seen plenty of grade A movies, The Godfather, Goodfellas, American History X, Cidade De Deus, Pulp Fiction, etc.

I:8414;887;It's as beautiful as film to watch as it is a beautiful story to experience.
I:8414;888;But the movie itself is so worth seeing I guess the omission of extras is forgivable.
I:8414;889;I'm going to use this forum to sing the praises of Morgan Freeman because this film is his greatest accomplishment in an impressive film career.
I:8414;890;As good as the ensemble of actors employed here Freeman's Red is the glue that holds the whole enterprise together.
I:8414;891;This performance is the difference between a very good film and a great one.

966;but the really sad parts were so well balanced that the story's real theme, hope, kept surfacing.
967;The ending was truly a thumbs up for getting over depression.
968;My favorite movie of all times!
969;This is one if my favorite movies !!!
970;love love Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman recommend 100 % Enjoy !!!
971;Tim Robbins was beautiful like he knew what he was doing!
972;"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison."
973;What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement.
974;It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing.
975;I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.
976;it is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible.
977;The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect.
978;You will take delight, I promise.
979;She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955).
980;It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs.
981;frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story.
982;the cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent.
983;all in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul.
984;It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.
985;This movie is a rite of passage for any person that goes to the movies.
986;There was a magic surrounding the creation of this piece of artistry that can only be marveled at.
987;I have seen it probably five or six times, and each time I see it, a deep sense of contentment comes over me, and I remember that being alive means having hope.
988;I really feel that this movie being created is a miracle and a gift to the human race.
989;YES, it is THAT good!!!
990;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman provide for the perfect contrast.
991;It is a movie about perseverance, tenacity, dedication and true and unwavering friendship.
992;I cheered each time I saw it.
993;Everytime I have been in a situation where I see no way out I remember this awe inspiring story!
994;There is always a ray of hope.
995;Andy Defrank's determination and fortitude are truly inspiring.
996;but every second is worth the wait for this triumph, climatic ending!
997;Good men do win in the end!
998;This is my all time favorite movie!!
999;It's amazing and I need 9 more words for this thing.
1000;This is a great movie.
1001;It's full of suspense, great acting, and great drama.
1002;wow were they pleasantly surprised.
1003;The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film and probably one of the best film of all time with a message of hope and inspiration to everyone.
1004;great acting especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
1005;direction was superb by first time director Frank Darabont.
1006;the musical score was also good.
1007;it will truly be enjoyed by anybody who love great films and those who wants films that can truly uplift the human spirit.
1008;If you haven't seen this movie already, you are in for a treat!
1009;Excellent acting, great story and well.
1010;Get ready for a truly great film.
1011;Every role cast was perfect.
1012;The narration by Morgan Freeman is a spot of brilliance by Director Frank Darabont and sets this apart from other similar movies such as the Green Mile.
1013;Its difficult to watch at times and the viewer is bombarded with the whole range of human emotions.
1014;Fabulous character development, great story.
1015;Truly one of the greatest twists in the history of film.
1016;A pleasure to watch EVEN until the story makes its delightful triumph.
1017;The movie was very good.
1018;would recommend for anyone wanting something of a real life in prison.
1019;I really liked this movie.
1020;He who laughs last laugh best.
1021;I think it is inspirational in a way.
1022;based on the Stephen King novella ' Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption ' this really has become a modern day classic.
1023;but also for the fact that his is the voice of the film.
1024;rich tones were director Frank Darabont's choice for the voice.
1025;Voice overs often dont work ( Blade Runner being a prime example ) but this one does, perfectly.
1026;the reward is worth it.
1027;eventually as we progress through the film, we see how Red's initial suspicion of Andy becomes a deep respect, and eventually a deep friendship, indeed it would be true to say that these two men love each other like brothers by the end.
1028;There are a few key scenes that really stick in the memory .
1029;the film's true emotional impact of course comes in the final third as we learn the truth about Andy's guilt or otherwise.
1030;good glow that lasts for days.
1031;"No""Trust me I said, ""It's the best movie you've never seen."""
1032;He bought it, and I like to think I made that man and wife cry, laugh and smile that evening.
1033;package, and give us fans the extras this classic deserves!P.
1034;The ten.year anniversary edition has righted many wrongs.
1035;The film has finally been done justice.
1036;I watched it again the other night, and again my eyes welled up at the end.
1037;This is a wonderful movie i love it.
1038;This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1039;A true story that's a must see movie.
1040;Shawshank redemption is one of my most favorite movies ever.
1041;The story is excellent,the action is incredible, and the ending is superb.
1042;Loved the movie and will definitely watch it again.
1043;This is a fantastic story told through a group of master thespians.
1044;I feel that The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful movie.
1045;It's the kind of movie that you can watch again and again.
1046;The story is original, engrossing, and ranges from funny to tragic, as it takes us through the trials and tribulations of an innocent man sent to Shawshank Prison.
1047;The acting is superb and the film ends magnificently.
1048;The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that every film buff should see at least once.
1049;Even though the setting is a prison from the early part of the 20th century, it is one of the most uplifting movie experiences that you will ever have!
1050;a man who can get you pretty much anything you desire.
1051;This is also a story of hope and what it can do to a man who is locked up for life and how he changes things (and people) while incarcerated.
1052;You have to see this film at least twice to appreciate the fine acting done by Robbins and Freeman, and to see how their friendship developes and changes over time.
1053;Every actor in this film does an excellant job in their portrayals.
1054;The film is directed by Frank Darabont (who also directed The Green Mile) and he has done an awesome job of taking this novella written by Stephen King (yes, that Stephen King!)
1055;and turning it into a beautiful and timeless film.
1056;The music score is fantastic, perfect for this type of film.
1057;I highly recommend this film to everyone who can appreciate a film that has substance, will stick with you long after you've seen it and make you want to watch it again!
1058;tHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of the best movies of its.
1059;here we have a story of patience and persistence.
1060;a story of deep friendship and ultimate triumph.
1061;"Pitted against a corrupt administration and a brutal prison culture, Andy has the patience and the persistence to score a stunning victory
I:8414;1062;freeman and (yes, I have to admit) Robbins are spectacular"
1063;It may or may not be a coincidence, but the two greatest films to celebrate the indomitable human spirit are both products of the mid.
1064;haves for serious movie buffs.
1065;A friend recommended this movie to me for years before I finally watched it.
1066;Of course when I finally checked it out I discovered that it is indeed very uplifting and inspiring.
1067;Being focused on triumph of the human spirit, of course there is going to be heavy.
1068;I've watched it numerous times now, so I recommend it highly as a movie worth watching and owning.
1069;This is simply the gratest movie I have ever seen.
1070;I enjoyed it because it is about so much more then just an innocent man going to prison.
1071;My favorite line from the movie is Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.
1072;The underlining moral of this film is the struggle for man kind to live the life that they have dreamed about.
1073;They form a tight, life.
1074;long friendship and everything revolves around them, especially DuFresne.
1075;The ins and outs of this movie and the wonderful, surprising ending make this a feel good movie despite some violence.
1076;Now I can watch it commercial free.
1077;this movie is based on a true story.
1078;I have seen this type of thing happen myself and I do know it's so very true, Harsh yes, but true.
1079;I love the real justice, and all the time and patience it takes to survive thru the trials and tribulations.
1080;Biblically, God rewards patient endurance, and this gives the greatest satisfaction of conquering your circumstances and beating back the Bully.
1081;This is one of my top.10 of all time.
1082;One of the top movies of all time.
1083;If you're a Shawshank fan, this is for you.
1084;The movie is as you must know, amazing.
1085;The bd transfer is great and the 7.1 audio (I only have a 5.1 system but it was nicely done and I'm sure the 7.1 could only be better).
1086;I loved this movie and watched it several times.
1087;Stephan King did it again with another great story, one of my favorites
1088;The blu ray transfer is very good, if you enjoyed the movie in std.
1089;"Everyone has their ""ONE"" story."
1090;this is such a story.
1091;"two men's journey or better said, ""One man's first impression of another man and then ultimately both their journey's""."
1092;meeting a few characters yet in this movie you watch Andy Dufrane (Robbins) develop both through the camera's eye and then through Red's eyes (Freeman)!
1093;you will cheer and appreciate this movie as it draws near to its end.
1094;This movie holds a surprise twist near its end .
1095;What a wonderful way to end this movie!!!
1096;The score for this movie is moving and disturbing.
1097;This is by far one of my favorite movies, and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two extraordinary actors.
1098;The five star rating tells the truth, you are pretty much guaranteed to love this movie.
1099;This is definitely one of the greatest films ever made.
1100;If you have never watched this, you should definitely watch.
1101;This is one of the best movies ever made.
1102;Everything about it is just Great!!!
1103;In addition to be an amazing story, the acting in this movie takes hold of you from the beginning.
1104;I don't normally watch movies more than once or twice, but Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that you share with friends.
1105;I ordered it and received it quickly and at a great price.
1106;Very good acting by Robbins and Freeman with strong supporting characters.
1107;Great story line with several twists.
1108;I'm so glad we took a chance because this is one of the greatest movies ever made!
1109;So much more than a prison film, this movie is an inspirational triumph of the human soul.
1110;a movie that can be watched over and over again with a great cast and story.
1111;It will keep you engrossed from beginning to end.
1112;A story about friendship, endurance, compassion and most of all hope!
1113;you know it's going to be good!
1114;This guy could recite the phone book and make it interestingI own the Blu Ray digi book edition and it is a huge improvement in picture and audio.
1115;Many people watch this movie over and over again.
1116;Its message of hope and redemption, not to mention sweet revenge, is timeless.
1117;"As Tim Robbins' character writes in this movie ""Hope is a good thing."""
1118;, and this movie gives us hope that intelligent movies might still be made in Hollywood.
1119;The color and sound were well done.
1120;The characters in this movie form a bond of friendship that is a joy to watch.
1121;This is one of the great movies that will withstand the test of time.
1122;Every so often comes a movie that just works on all levels.
1123;The Shawshank redemption is one of these movies .
1124;While Steven King is known mostly for his gore and horror stories, these are his two best works ever.
1125;The rest of the cast is excellent of course.
1126;one of the true measures of a movie is how it looks ten years after it's released.
1127;it's as fresh and enjoyable to watch as the day it came out of the edit suite!
1128;the script is great, the acting is great, the musical score is great.
1129;not since The Godfather has a movie been this moving.
1130;I reccomend this to anybody who likes GOOD movies.
1131;My fiance was turned on to the wonderful world of King with this movie.
1132;studded cast and is a very poignant film.
1133;A classic drama about overcoming extreme adversity played by superior actors.
1134;This is a great movie for guys and girls!
1135;Unlike most great film this one truly gets better throughout its duration.
1136;The acting, story, direction and music in this film is perfect.
1137;I've seen thousands of films but this is my favorite without a doubt.
1138;Every time I watch it I still feel the huge power and raw emotion this film possesses.
1139;This is the greatest movie of all time.
1140;spiritual redemption leading to the come.
1141;This is a really good movie.
1142;I suppose I could just leave that sentence and not write any more, but I feel that I need to jabber on about how it is a good movie.
1143;I respect a movie that makes the viewer seem like they're living it.
1144;Not one with characters so endearing, so believable.
1145;I do believe it's in part due to the wonderful writing of Stephen King's story, from which this film is adapted, but some of the credit has to go to the actors and directors.
1146;an uplifting story with a great central message.
1147;It's been a favorite of mine since I saw it in the theater long ago.
1148;Every detail of this movie is perfect.
1149;it's just one perfect scene and line of dialogue after another, until the tear.
1150;The music is lovely and adds much to the atmosphere.
1151;The character of the warden is not only an evil villain, he is believable and you will TOTALLY despise him.
1152;This movie is just amazing and inspiring.
1153;My son is 16 and he agrees!
1154;make sure you can watch it all the way through without stopping.
1155;I watch the movie before the showing of it in class.
1156;I thought it was okay.
1157;But who could've ever imagined that a film based on friendship and perseverance could be so engaging and just flat out good?
1158;This is truly one of the BEST movies I have ever seen (along with City of God, the Pianist, Amelie, Life is Beautiful, Ever After and Bowling for Columbine) and I would recommend it to everyone.
1159;It is a must for your movie collection.
1160;Steven King at his most imaginative and best.
1161;The movie is absolutely compelling.
1162;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great.
1163;This is one of the best movies ever to come out so it's only fitting that it gets a proper blu ray treatment.
1164;The #2 best movie of all time?
1165;I heard of this movie from friends and It is a great movie with excellent cinematography.
1166;Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are at their best
1167;I need not even mention how wonderful this film is, as it's a classic in my book.
1168;I was expecting it to look worse considering the age of the film, but I was pleasantly surprised.
1169;I loved this movie because even though society wrongly accused this man, he was able to overcome and after much suffering he showed them who was the clever one.
1170;The support actor was awesome as well!
1171;Besides the movie is an expectacular hymn of hope, the presentation and blu.
1172;the book has also good insights of the actors and present The Shawshank Redemption in a new perspective.
1173;The ending was perfect, and I think the director purposely set it up so that all of us are dying to go down to the beach and hug Andy and Red.
1174;"portrayed so wonderfully by Tim Robbins,it represents so much 
I:8414;1175;his character is one of the most inspiring I've ever known.
I:8414;1176;An example of the strength of the human spirit, and one basic rule : diligence and patience with a little bit of luck and wisdom can get you anywhere . . . Even outside the walls of Shawshank state penitentiary.
I:8414;1177;i bet it shall lift your spirit just a little bit higher ,and help you through the crisis .
I:8414;1178;Shawshank is an absolutely amazing film.
I:8414;1179;i saw Shawshank in the cinema, which is always good, but not necessary for a film where the plot and filmatic skill are what draw you in.
I:8414;1180;The film is so beautiful that even the tough people cried.
I:8414;1181;Well, perhaps sadness has something to do with it, but it's a deeper kind of sadness, one that's got tears of joy in it too, not """"how could they kill the dog?"""""""
1182;notice that this movie is loved by all kinds of viewers.
1183;This is my all time favorite Prison Film
1184;One of the best movies!
1185;I also love the music pay close attention.
1186;The reason: both films represent the reasons why I watch movies in the first place.
1187;provoked, challenged, and inspired, all of which The Shawshank Redemption accomplishes and more.
1188;But if we take charge of our very own existence, appreciate everything we have and can accomplish, then the very process of living can be wonderful.
1189;Even the most cynical people I know still love this movie, a grand statement for just how powerfully effective it is.
1190;year old with the attention span of a fly, and the movie still gripped me like no other), but it fits perfectly with the themes at work, and much of the dialogue is so beautifully written, the film simply demands repeat viewings to gather it all.
1191;Darabont's direction is equally as terrific, keeping things low.
1192;key and seemingly unexceptional, but truly crafting something memorable and brilliant.
1193;Thomas Newman's remarkable score is emotionally touching and uplifting, perfectly fitting with the movie's tone.
1194;but great as the direction and writing may be, what puts this over the top for me are the performances.
1195;Everyone here is excellent, without the slightest minor exception.
1196;Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver the best, most powerful performance of their careers in crafting two of the most memorable characters in cinema, with the former proving why he's the greatest actor around and the latter showing why he's one of the more underrated performers.
1197;The film is primarily about the friendship between Dufresne and Red, how a man can bring hope to a cynic in even a place as confined as Shawshank Penitentiary.
1198;In supporting turns, James Whitmore and William Sadler are exceptional as prisoners who befriend Dufresne.
1199;Sadler, in particular, begins the film as a total ass, and it's to his credit that by the end, his transformation to a genuinely likeable character is entirely believable.
1200;Even Gil Bellows is excellent here, and anyone who's seen Ally Mcbeal knows he typically defines bland.
1201;the Shawshank Redemption's ending is, quite simply, fabulous.
1202;hour is perfect, from the big surprise twist to the pacing to the music to the acting right down to the very final scene.
1203;The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect film, and I'm absolutely certain nothing will ever match it, much less surpass it.
1204;what we have here is a masterpiece of filmwork.
1205;The story, from beginning to end, it engaging and fast paced.
1206;The acting here is superb.
1207;Freeman and Robbins shine and their chemistry together is magical.
1208;This really was a great movie.
1209;one of the best of the past 10 years.
1210;Loved the screenplay, loved the actors, loved the cinematography, loved the score!
1211;This is simply one of those movies that i can watch over and over and feel as moved as the first time that i watched it, and how often can someone truly say that about a movie.
1212;time favorite movie, truly a classic.
1213;tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman amazing actors.
1214;Either way though it will make for a great gift for someone else.
1215;The Shawshank Redemption definitely rates as one of the best movies of all time.
1216;Frank Darabont( Director of the Green Mile) orchestrates this moving masterpiece.
1217;With captivating performances all around, the movie subjects you to the power of human spirit.
1218;To quote the movie hope is a great thing,perhaps the best of things,and no good thing ever dies.
1219;The Shawshank Redemption will not only restore your faith in movies, but in humanity as well.
1220;seriously, this is the best movie of all time, its awesome, morgan freeman, tim robbins, great everything, one of those movies you have to see
1221;i recommend such a movie for all kinds of movie fans.
1222;Of course, as it has always happened many, many times with this movie before, I got so absorbed with the characters, the excellence of the direction, acting, cinematography, music.
1223;taken for a ride of contemplation and emotion that at times I'll admit nearly brought me to a tear .
1224;com to see if it was actually available.
1225;I read them all, and felt so happy to the very end.
1226;There is hope for humanity after all.
1227;I am very glad to share this genuine appreciation of great film.
1228;Great story, nigh great acting, and all the rest of great words you read about this movie are by and large true.
1229;Yet, I take one (big) exception with this movie and interrupt the series of great qualifiers by asking: How could the hair style and physiognomy of the main two characters stay the same over 20 years of prison time?
1230;There are a ton of extras on the Blu Ray.
1231;This seller deserves the top rating for service.
1232;She went above and beyond what I would have expected.
1233;Timeless, poignant story of friendship, hope, and survival against a background of almost insurmountable odds.
1234;this film is a must see in the top ten for all to appreciate the magnificent story and superb acting of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.
1235;A couple of hours well spent indeed.
1236;Definetely one of the top three movies I have ever seen.
1237;I know it is a few years old but still one of the best movies!!
1238;This was one of the best films of the 1990's and was all but snubbed by the Academy.
1239;frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's short story was a thing of beauty.
1240;security prison, and survives on sheer intelligence, guile and will is expertly spun and engrossing.
1241;The ending is uplifting and exhilarating.
1242;both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave career performances.
1243;Robbins was outstanding in the portrayal of a character whose phlegmatic and understated persona belied his cunning and razor sharp intellect.
1244;Freeman was also fantastic as the old convict who knew how to get things done in the joint.
1245;Freeman's performance got him a Best Actor nomination in a year when Tom Hanks was a cinch.
1246;The direction, the cinematography, the sound and the music were all top flight.
1247;i rated this film a 10/10.
1248;I highly recommend it, although viewers should be advised that there is some disturbing prison violence.
1249;Whether it was the lack of a catchy title, or the rather bland movie poster showing Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the true spirit of this film never got the attention it deserved at it's big.
1250;It is a compelling story of the strength of human character, emerging from the most hopeless of situations.
1251;The cinematography and musical score are magical, especially in the scene where Red is dropped off in Buxton to search the fields for Andy's stash, and where he finally reunites with Andy in Mexico.
1252;All this was put together by a talented director who can go to his grave knowing he orchestrated one of the finest films in history.
1253;I envy those who are watching it for the first time.
1254;It is so completely engrossing a story, never boring, with a truely satisfying ending.
1255;This is a very moving film, someone that's been put in jail for something he didn't do it's already harsh but the reality in prison is even worse, and to think the main character (very well acted by Tim) never lose it and he really is trying to make the most of this unfairness, helping the fellow prisoners and even the guards it's really moving.
1256;the outcome of this film it's something else, amazing, well crafted piece of direction, Morgan Freeman's character is great here, everything pulled together to be one real inspiring momentum.
1257;driven film, the audio is good enough.
1258;see movie of a man.
1259;The Shawshank Redemption break through the limitations of man movie, incredibly warm tone throughout almost full, the greatest movie theme is hope .
1260;Wisdom, trust, hope, and courage to face the fear, to defeat it?
1261;"When he arrives the resourceful ""Red"" (Freeman) believes the aloof man will be a pushover."
1262;He still has one miraculous trick up his sleeve.
1263;"Fittingly he instills ""Red"" with hope and in the end they are reunited."
1264;I found this film intriguing because in such a corrupt and immoral place, Andy always seems to strive for good.
1265;His spirit is ultimately inextinguishable.
1266;It is a great story with a great ending.
1267;it's a movie of true substance that requires an open mind to really appreciate it.
1268;while Gump is a good movie, basically it just a lot of historical events gradually being connected together with Gump as the link.
1269;It is a great story and Darabont is a great storyteller.
1270;abiding citizen, you should be able to relate to this film.
1271;Small wonder that this film has such a substantial following.
1272;featuring a script with no wasted scenes, superb lighting by the great Roger Deakins, a magnificently understated performance by Tim Robbins, an academy award.
1273;nominated performance by Morgan Freeman, and quite a bit more.
1274;"I thought the storyline of ""The Shining"" was really stupid but I managed to still enjoy watching it because of the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick who somehow managed to make my eyes addicted to watching the film not for the storyline but for the wonderful images we get to watch courtesy of the Kubrick genius."
1275;"I detected some Kubrick influences here like the scene of the soaring overhead view of the prison near the beginning which has its parallel in the beginning of ""The Shining"" but overall as a film with a great script, great casting and great directing of a Stephen King story this has to be the best one ever."
1276;together digibook format among the best blu.
1277;ray releases that I've ever seen.
1278;great script, great acting, great storytelling makes this film a must.
1279;This film has that truly exceptional touch of magic, that very few motion pictures have.
1280;An absolute gem of a film, that has taken its rightful place alongside classics, in my mind, such as Casablanca.
1281;The cinematography is rich, life affirming, encompassing, and colorful.
1282;"The screenplay is in parts positively sublime
I:8414;1283;simplistic and direct screenwriting that keeps it simple and truthful.
I:8414;1284;And the direction of this film is fantastic.
I:8414;1285;this is not just a truly great film, it is also a necessary one.
I:8414;1286;The values it discusses and the emotions it conveys are in short supply in today's world: love, patience, perserverence, trust, loyalty, sensitivity, truth, and compassion.
I:8414;1287;This was one of Steven King's best books.
I:8414;1288;Then making it into a movie for me was great, even with the customary differences, I loved the movie.
I:8414;1289;Steven King has a true gift for drama that makes you wonder why he does horrors at all and narration was perfect.
I:8414;1290;go to any extent to see this film.
I:8414;1291;Boy, I really scored on this one!
I:8414;1292;It was a fine, fine movie and for under four dollars!
I:8414;1293;Alas, this one already has over a thousand Amazon reviews and a lot of them are very well done!
I:8414;1294;I'd just like to add a few of my impressions and suggest you read some of the very fine top reviews.
I:8414;1295;The direction, the photography and sound and the flow of the story were all first rate.
I:8414;1296;The acting was excellent across the board and throughout the movie.
I:8414;1297;teerm resident """"Red"""" (Morgan Freeman) and they very gradually developed a deep friendship over the next several decades."""
1298;Finally, after enduring decades of this depraved life, Andy manages a very clever escape.
1299;the plot was extremely well done and carried out with only one exception.
1300;If you've seen the Green Mile, this movie has that kind of feel to it, except without the supernatural stuff.
1301;A very good movie, Morgan freeman was great.
1302;'The Shawshank Redemption' is in my opinion one of the best movies ever.
1303;ray version, and if we are surfing channels on Direct TV and we come across this movie we will watch it.
1304;The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen.
1305;It is the story of friendship,time,and most importantly, hope.
1306;While in prison, he meets Red, who is played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman.
1307;The unlikely friendship that forms between these two men who come from such diverse backgrouds is a part of what makes this movie so incredible.
1308;"They become each others best friend and confidant
I:8414;1309;the music of this movie is what ties all the emotional elements together.
I:8414;1310;Thomas Newman does an amazing job with the soundtrack.
I:8414;1311;His music transports you to the movie's place and time.
I:8414;1312;It has the power to make you feel what the characters are experienceing.
I:8414;1313;but the one elment that makes this movie so truly remarkable is the theme of hope.
I:8414;1314;It gives us something to be excited about and reminds us to continue to hope in our everyday lives.
I:8414;1315;Red, on the other hand, thinks hope is a dangerous thing.
I:8414;1316;But Andy pursists and wins Red over by the end of the film.
I:8414;1317;I think Andy says it best when he states, Hope is a good thing.
I:8414;1318;Maybe even the best of things.
I:8414;1319;Me and a fellow critic who I admire were just talking about Morgan Freeman's performance.
I:8414;1320;It was outstanding, only seen by him in one other film(Seven).
I:8414;1321;This is the feel good movie of all time.
I:8414;1322;It is a story of the human soul and spirit and overcoming things that keep your inspiration down.
I:8414;1323;Sometimes, however, something truly deserving works its way into the public consciousness.
I:8414;1324;These guys are played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, respectively, and the two great actors give the best performances that I've seen from either of them.
I:8414;1325;No one else has too huge of a role, but everyone is certainly believable enough, and the minor characters have enough quirks and strange things about them to make them interesting with out turning them into caricatures.
I:8414;1326;The score is fairly conventional, but it's also very beautiful and haunting, and a perfect backdrop to the more significant scenes.
I:8414;1327;Thus, pretty much every scene is important, in its way.
I:8414;1328;it also deserves particular credit for the remarkably good adaptation.
I:8414;1329;They manage to both condense and bolster the material, combining characters and creating new ones and just solidifying a tale that was remarkably formless and free flowing, all while remaining quite faithful to the source material.
I:8414;1330;Furthermore, the screenwriter had a particularly good eye for the most memorable lines of the novella and finds a way to include all of them in the film.
I:8414;1331;again, this is a film that relies on human interest and is fundamentally a feel.
I:8414;1332;good kinda film, in spite of the fact that almost everything that happens in this film is bad.
I:8414;1333;Of course, this is probably why it works with so many people.
I:8414;1334;A film that talks about how wonderful life is unlikely to make anyone feel good about themselves if they think about it too much.
I:8414;1335;Thematically it is simple, just saying that happiness come form within, and how we have to find joy in little things and always cling to hope and so on.
I:8414;1336;Again, simple stuff, but absolutely true and I've never heard anything truly profound in a movie anyway.
I:8414;1337;The best you can hope for with thematic effect in a films comes from making you remember and believe what you already knew, again.
I:8414;1338;Lotsa people didn't seem to notice that, as that isn't what you're looking for in a horror movie, but it's there if you want it, and makes that into a truly great film.
I:8414;1339;But, on the other hand, I'm a fairly bitter and cynical person myself, yet I love this movie and am moved by the more effective scenes every time even after about 10 or so viewings over a decade.
I:8414;1340;This is one of King's best tales.
I:8414;1341;The movie is true to the book and has the assembly of some very fine actors, including Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
I:8414;1342;It is a charming tale, with great photography and excellent performances by every member of the cast.
I:8414;1343;Character develpment is a hallmark of King's writing.
I:8414;1344;This reviewer has seen this movie many times and it is just as engaging now as it was upon the first viewing.
I:8414;1345;A wonder of modern cinema.
I:8414;1346;Frank Darabont has included into this film his absolutely remarkable talent of direction and writing, complete with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's selection, make this a higly recommended title.
I:8414;1347;and one of Darabont's greatest films
I:8414;1348;This is a great Steven King movie.
I:8414;1349;I am not a Tim Robbins fan, however, he is excellent in this movie
I:8414;1350;RObbins and Freeman deliver the goods here.
I:8414;1351;IT's a example for those guys that think that Stephen King can only write about horror.
I:8414;1352;He proved more than once that is an amazing and versatile writer.
I:8414;1353;This one is an example, APT PUPIL another .
I:8414;1354;This movies here is majestic, nearing perfection, a pleasant surprise in this age of imbecile and mediocre films like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE II.
I:8414;1355;I have watched this movie about 4.5 times over the last ten years and it makes more sense each time.
I:8414;1356;In the end, it has a good lesson to take away with you.
I:8414;1357;It is a hopeful story.
I:8414;1358;This movie is a real masterpiece: the poetic dialogues, the protagonists' intense performance, the human values of dignity and solidarity.
I:8414;1359;In other words, Andy waits for the right moment to be free: he knows his innocence and is aware that it is necessary to be careful and wisely strategic.
I:8414;1360;In modern culture the metaphor of sheep resists as an idiom defining a condition of passive subjection.
I:8414;1361;Ulysses' eyes of mind are always open and allow him to save his own life.
I:8414;1362;Similarly, Andy's eyes of hope are always open, as well, nevertheless the other prisoners provoke him fiercely and try to discourage him.
I:8414;1363;The same happens to Andy, who demonstrates the courage of the wait and the strategic attitude of a champion of chess (another fascinating metaphor recurring in the movie).
I:8414;1364;And you'll be wrapped around my finger .
I:8414;1365;control and patience at last win.
I:8414;1366;A great lesson of life for all of us.
I:8414;1367;this movie meets these criterias very well.
I:8414;1368;Inspires you (good for repeat viewing).
I:8414;1369;A great story, with a great cast, and great direction.
I:8414;1370;I honestly believe this to be one of Morgan Freeman's, and Tim Robbins best roles to date.
I:8414;1371;The characters in this film are some of the best written I've ever seen in a film.
I:8414;1372;it's a very touching story and couldn't have a better cast or director.
I:8414;1373;The book is really brilliant, but I'm of the opinion that the movie did the unthinkable and actually improved on it.
I:8414;1374;Although the movie is really brilliant, the book is better.
I:8414;1375;Still, both of them are worth every dollar and every minute (and I'm able to say this even after seeing Shawshank about 8 times and Green Mile more than 3)!
I:8414;1376;It's such a great example of the human spirit, how it can endure even through the worst situations.
I:8414;1377;It's also a testament to the importance of freedom and redemption.
I:8414;1378;We watch it every time it comes on so now we can see it any time we choose.
I:8414;1379;This is an excellent prison genre film that realistically depicts life behind bars.
I:8414;1380;Prisoners have an uncanny ability to realize a potential, they probably misused on the outside of prison walls, to become more creative.
I:8414;1381;Overall the movie is a heartening depiction of human will overcoming insurmountable odds.
I:8414;1382;Morgan Freeman's performance was superb and I would wholeheartedy recommend watching this movie.
I:8414;1383;If you Morgan Freeman you will diefinely want to see this movie.
I:8414;1384;Robbins and Freeman are terrific in this film!A great story and twist at the end!
I:8414;1385;This movie is the best.
I:8414;1386;The acting is superb and the story is so real.
I:8414;1387;Great performances by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
I:8414;1388;i wanna say that this movie is probably the best I have ever watched!
I:8414;1389;If u liked to please mail me and we can share thought about this historical history!
I:8414;1390;The Shawshank Redemption is now one my all time favorite movies.
I:8414;1391;Morgan Freeman, as Red , narrates the complex story of one intelligent man, Andy, who is wrongly imprisoned for murder.
I:8414;1392;banker, played perfectly by Tim Robbins, quietly lives his life behind bars and in the sand.yard.
I:8414;1393;He subtly works his magical patience and resolve over a span of many years and delivers to other memorable characters and to us, the one thing we all need to know exists.
I:8414;1394;There is so much to this tale.
I:8414;1395;beautifully shot, well adapted, and perfectly casted, Shawshank will forever be a shimmering wave of emotion.
I:8414;1396;thanks for your interest comments.
I:8414;1397;This film is definitely one of favorite films and I feel one of the greatest films of all times.

I:8414;1413;Without getting into plot, i'm going to say this was the greatest movies of the 90's, if not ever.
I:8414;1414;The story is powerful and the charaters fit it perfectly.
I:8414;1415;The ending is a true masterpeice, and the revenge is sweet.
I:8414;1416;Stephen king is truely a great writer
I:8414;1417;This is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
I:8414;1418;A banker framed for murderand a convict become friends at a New England prison.
I:8414;1419;this is one of my favorite films and Morgan and Timare terrific together.
I:8414;1420;This special edition has nicepicture and sound plus neat extras.
I:8414;1421;The movie is quite unique in that it is the only movie based on a Stephen King book where the movie is actually better than the written word.
I:8414;1422;The story, the acting, the message of hope and the scenery out of the prison are all compelling.
I:8414;1423;The ending of the movie is just fantastic.
I:8414;1424;the movie can be viewed again and again.
I:8414;1425;On the various lists of the top movies of all time it is near the top of the lists.
I:8414;1426;It's an incredible story, and the movie is even better.
I:8414;1427;It's the best prison drama ever made.
I:8414;1428;It's a must see for anyone who loves great movies.
I:8414;1429;in this wonderful screen adaption, Andrew Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is a young banker who is convicted of killing his wife.
I:8414;1430;He makes friends with a man called Red (played by Morgan Freeman), a man who can get things.
I:8414;1431;This friendship grows, and soon becomes very strong.
I:8414;1432;in the end, this is a movie about hope, about never giving up.
I:8414;1433;The acting in this film is great, enough so to match the plot.
I:8414;1434;It is a true classic, one that everyone needs to see.
I:8414;1435;A classic film, so I will not review it here.
I:8414;1436;If you haven't seen it, see it.
I:8414;1437;For anyone who liked the film, the special features are well worth the price.
I:8414;1438;How do describe it?Smart story, a lot of suspense, an incredibly good Tim Robbins.
I:8414;1439;i could see this movie over and over again!
I:8414;1440;i had one of the best moment of my life in front of the sceen thanks to this monument of art great acting great story nothing else to say just pure pleasure
I:8414;1441;The Shawshank Redemption is definitely one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8414;1442;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do an outstanding job in their roles.
I:8414;1443;The story and characters are just phenomenal.
I:8414;1444;I really want to read the book to gain an even greater understanding of the characters.
I:8414;1445;Wonderful film with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman about institutionalization, hope, and honesty among friends.
I:8414;1446;A great Clint Eastwood production.
I:8414;1447;but then so many events take place that you ignore your beliefs and sense the thrilling powerful struggle and injustice taking place.
I:8414;1448;the drama is very interesting and amazingly put together that you do not get bored at all but keep on living the changes and frequent ups and downs.
I:8414;1449;morgan Freeman, played with viewers emotions with his deep character who gave up hope but managed to survive in jail.
I:8414;1450;this is a great movie not to be ignored.
I:8414;1451;Definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.
I:8414;1452;it is such a great movie that a have seen a hundred times and would see it a hundred more times.
I:8414;1453;This is one of the best yarns that has ever spun on a screen.
I:8414;1454;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8414;1455;And Steven King has a number of great stories to compare with.
I:8414;1456;The characters are very believable due to the great acting, and you build a lot of empathy for them despite their despicable pasts.
I:8414;1457;It has been a long time since I have actually cried while watching a film or sat on the edge of my seat literally in suspense, but `The Shawshank Redemption' managed to make me do both.
I:8414;1458;the characters are what make this movie brilliant and the casting of Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy was spot on.
I:8414;1459;They managed to convince me that I was watching real life and actual circumstances rather than just a realistic portrayal of the prison world.
I:8414;1460;i felt inspired by the ideas raised and loved how my mind was encouraged to consider certain beliefs and rules in society.
I:8414;1461;Frank Darabont has produced an excellent movie which does not disappoint in any way.
I:8414;1462;I would recommend `The Shawshank Redemption' to anyone over the age of about 15 as a brilliant and enlightening drama.
I:8414;1463;One of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8414;1464;shawashank Redemption is one such movie with the premise thatif you loose hope you stop living.
I:8414;1465;Great movies have one thing in common,a Screen writer who also wields the megaphone.
I:8414;1466;god bless these kindred since they have made some great movies and Shawshank Redemption is one of them.
I:8414;1467;This is a feel good movie in the sense that you see a bad guy get what he deserves, and others redeemed.
I:8414;1468;Based on a Stephen King's shot novel, this ambitious film has several levels to analyze.
I:8414;1469;His perseverance, patience and goodwill will transform the inhumanity and soon he will sculpt not only chess figures on rock, but the respect and tender of every man in the prison.
I:8414;1470;Thanks to his experience in the Finances World, he will create a solid reputation and special status among the prison's highest authorities.
I:8414;1471;and in that state of things, you will understand there are two suggested, deserved and beautiful homage to Robert Bresson's A man escapes, and Alejandro Dumas?
I:8414;1472;stunning film and one of the most important American pictures in the nineties.
I:8414;1473;You can read a lot of reviews here about how great the movie is.
I:8414;1474;I agree that this is a SUPER movie and a wonderful story and a GREAT ending.
I:8414;1475;get past that and this is a classic.
I:8414;1476;This is a fantastic package.
I:8414;1477;For big fans of this movie.
I:8414;1478;TIM ROBBINS and MORGAN FREEMAN have created characters that will live on in your heart and memory.
I:8414;1479;The prison friendship that develops and evolves over decades between TIM ROBBINS AND MORGAN FREEMAN is a beautiful thing to see.
I:8414;1480;My husband loves this movie so I bought it for him and he made me watch it.
I:8414;1481;I ended up liking it.
I:8414;1482;Placed ordered at 1 in the afternoon, picked it up from the mail box the next day at 9 in the morning.
I:8414;1483;But there is more of a story in the movie thanks to Frank Darabont.
I:8414;1484;This movie was in 1994, and nominated for best picture.
I:8414;1485;This is way better than the extremely overrated Forrest Gump that won for best picture that year.
I:8414;1486;On a last note, Tom Hanks is cool, but it is unneceptable how he won for best actor over Mogan Freeman's triumphant acting in this film.
I:8414;1487;This is a great movie.
I:8414;1488;Partly the voiceover by Morgan Freeman, partly the underplaying by Tim Robbins, partly the brilliant setting of mood by Director Frank Darabont, partly the importance given to making all the speaking parts interesting characters, all together it stands as a great movie.
I:8414;1489;A feel good film that's for sure.
I:8414;1490;Shawshank is our all time favorite movie.
I:8414;1491;The story is moving, the acting is superb, and you just melt listening to Morgan Freeman's narrative.
I:8414;1492;We introduced our teen girls to this great movie and they loved it"
1493;"Brilliant movie
I:8414;1494;The story however is told through Morgan Freeman with his usual excellent narration, and the majority of the story takes place in the grey frigid prison, and the length of the movie helped emphasize the feeling most of the characters had of spending most of their life behind bars.
I:8414;1495;the acting is uniformly great, my favorite probably being the greaser that comes mid.
I:8414;1496;Morgan's sensitive portrayal of a repentant armed robber is exemplary, and his onscreen paring with Tim Robbins is a masterstroke of casting and chemistry.
I:8414;1497;This is the best movie ever.
I:8414;1498;Extra content and style is great as well.
I:8414;1499;This is one of the best movies of all time.
I:8414;1500;This is by far one of my favorite movies.
I:8414;1501;When I see it on tv, which it is on plenty, I watch it again.
I:8414;1502;Nice of them to put it on Blu.
I:8414;1503;Emotionally satisfying on so many levels.
I:8414;1504;This is just one of those movies that is a must see.
I:8414;1505;This is third time I've bought it.
I:8414;1506;The Shawshank Redemption was a very powerful drama movie with amazing acting job by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman what was most shocking was the fact it was wirtten by Steven King never knew he had a talent for more then just horror and suspense triller books.
I:8414;1507;To me this is one of best movies ever made in movie history, some people feel this 2 disc special edition deserves more special features but I think it had enough special features.
I:8414;1508;But no matter what people say this is a truly great movie and deserves to be in anyone's drama movie collection for all time.
I:8414;1509;Also for some it shows how life inside prison really works day to day year after year all its dirty little secrets.
I:8414;1510;This movie is truly a masterpiece, overshadowed by the war epic named Braveheart.
I:8414;1511;why Morgan freeman didnt win Best Actor is mindblowing after his performance as Red .
I:8414;1512;His scenes alone towards the end of the film are wonderful and are my favorite part of the whole film.
I:8414;1513;Another stellar performance was by Clancy Brown who has made a career out of playing total jerks, plays the meanest of the prisons guards.
I:8414;1514;an epic tale of friendship and endurance through life's trials.
I:8414;1515;I wonder how many people do that as well!
I:8414;1516;This Blu Ray came in great shape with good packaging and fast delivery.
I:8414;1517;I can say this much it is an extremely good movie and an even better storyline with great acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, truely outstanding.
I:8414;1518;The send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take.This is one of the most inspirational movies I've ever watched.
I:8414;1519;another great part of this film is the portrayal of the other inmates.
I:8414;1520;He is befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman) who also is serving a life.
I:8414;1521;But on the outside world, along with being a banker, Dufresne was very interested in geology and rocks, and is convinced he can escape with his knowledge.
I:8414;1522;many years pass, and Andy gains lots of respect from all of the prison.
I:8414;1523;He decides it is time to escape from Shawshank.
I:8414;1524;The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie.
I:8414;1525;It really portrays another world.
I:8414;1526;I definetly reccomend it to anyone.
I:8414;1527;a B class actor and that led the critics to look at it.
I:8414;1528;This is what storytelling at it's finest.
I:8414;1529;Name another movie with better storytelling.
I:8414;1530;Very moving emotional story, with a 'Disney Ending'Unable to find 'WHO': Allen Greene .
I:8414;1531;It is by far the best movie.
I:8414;1532;Good to add to the shelf
I:8414;1533;Every so often, a certain type of movie comes along that deeply moves anyone who watches it.
I:8414;1534;This movie is grand in scope and scale, its character portrayals so moving and so real, that you cannot help becoming completely engrossed by it.
I:8414;1535;I believe that the Shawshank Redemption is one of these movies.
I:8414;1536;defining performances from many of its cast members,including Tim Robbins, who became a top star after his incredible performance, and Morgan Freeman, who added to his already impressive list of accolades with his perfect supporting role.
I:8414;1537;Robbins plays this part to perfection, showing emotional vulnerability, as well as the stregnth to overcome the greatest adversity.
I:8414;1538;Red adapts to his life in prison by becoming a source for bringing outside goods to prisoners.
I:8414;1539;The interplay between Robbins and Freeman is one of the highlights of the movie, as these two wonderful actors test each other's limits.
I:8414;1540;Bob Gunton takes a memorable turn as Bible.
I:8414;1541;Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed this movie,is a master of skilfully portraying human emotions.
I:8414;1542;He deserves all the credit he gets for helping to shape this memorable movie experience.
I:8414;1543;Stepen King's brilliance shines through, as his ability to create complex and memorable characters is evident in this movie.
I:8414;1544;The bottom line is this: The Shawshank Redemption is a monumental achievement in motion picture history.
I:8414;1545;It is defined by a memorable story, engrossing character performances, and one of the most truly gratifying endings I have ever seen in a movie.
I:8414;1546;This is truly one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8414;1547;Stephen King and Frank Darabont are quite a team.
I:8414;1548;They did 'The Green Mile' together, another superb prison drama.
I:8414;1549;'Shawshank' is definately a classic, and as far as I'm concerned, it's up there with the cinema greats of all time.
I:8414;1550;If you judge a film by its emotional impact, then this one is clearly a winner.
I:8414;1551;Redemption has an engaging story line but it also serves as a narrative of Andy's character development.
I:8414;1552;The one theme that I took away from the film is how the actions, high personal standards set by one individual can influence, lift up and inspire an entire community, even if this community consists of prisoners.
I:8414;1553;All of the characters are complex, richly developed, intelligently casted and wonderfully portrayed.
I:8414;1554;Intellectually spriritually rewarding (can't say that about 95% of the product which is on video shelves today).
I:8414;1555;is just chilling to watch and should be considered a yardstick other performances are compared to.
I:8414;1556;Worth the watch if you haven't seen it.
I:8414;1557;This movie is a classic.
I:8414;1558;The special edition gives interviews with the actors and little known information about the making of the screen.
I:8414;1559;and their performances are a true testament to their art.
I:8414;1560;i have watched this film many times over and continue to be impressed by the amazing nuances and performances.
I:8414;1561;i would recommend this film to anyone who loves film.
I:8414;1562;Morgan Freeman is superb as always, but Tim Robbins is also amazing.
I:8414;1563;The story, the drama, and the suspense is outstanding.
I:8414;1564;It is one of my favorite movies.
I:8414;1565;great movie and arrived quickly and in great shape.
I:8414;1566;ray version is really nice!
I:8414;1567;Superb movie and even better on blu.
I:8414;1568;There is not much to really say about this movie other then it's great.
I:8414;1569;The movie was one of the greatest I've ever seen.
I:8414;1570;One of my very favorite movies.
I:8414;1571;This has little to do with anything other than fine acting, great story and probabably one of the best cast put together to pull this off.
I:8414;1572;Morgan, as always is so into his role, which I think made the movie.
I:8414;1573;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8414;1574;Acting, story, plot, cinematography, and scenery all combine for a memorable experience.
I:8414;1575;There are some tough parts (graphic) and some tender points but in the end you'll feel hopeful and full of life.
I:8414;1576;This is a movie you'll love at first viewing, and appreciate more and more each time you watch it.
I:8414;1577;The extra features let you get inside the movie.
I:8414;1578;Comes in a very good book kind of really
I:8414;1579;Never before have I seen a movie that is so profoundly human.
I:8414;1580;It is a celebration of the human spirit and that great thing that we have called hope.
I:8414;1581;do yourselves a favour and watch this movie.
I:8414;1582;Let it inspire you"
1583;She also found it to be one of her favorite movies of all times.
1584;it speaks volumes to the value found in connecting with others around you.
1585;Its rare, but sometimes those random connections can forge friendships that will span time and the globe.
1586;They are truely something to draw strength from.
1587;I really enjoyed this movie when I first watched it, as I did most movies with Tim Robbins.
1588;When was the last time CNN asked you about whether you liked a candidate, or policy?Anyway, Tim Robbins is a great actor, but I can't get the image of him telling me how to think out of my head when I see him act now.
1589;I do like prison movies and this has to be the best of the best.
1590;I don't always like Tim Robbins but this role is perfect for him.
1591;I do always like Morgan Freeman so anything he is in works for me.
1592;The cool way Tim Robbins character handles many years in prison is inspirational.
1593;The interaction between Tim and Morgan is timeless.
1594;The revenge ending is perfect as is the direction, acting, and scenery.
1595;This is down to earth human storytelling at its best.
1596;great story plot, superb actors who keep you glued onto the screen, just to see how it all unfolds.
1597;It is a very good movie.
1598;The type of movie you can watch many times, and always enjoy it.
1599;Please read the Stephen King story as well, it is one of his best stories.
1600;Great movie, should be mandatory viewing for all human beings.
1601;The great story meets excellent pacing and tone by Director Frank Darabont, and suburb acting.
1602;I have just finished it, and I believe that this movie should be in everyone's library.
1603;It really shows you a story about life.
1604;that wants to put a smile on their face.
1605;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unbelievably relaxed, effortless performances, not to mention the often overlooked heart wrenching performance by James Whitmore as Brooks Hadlen.
1606;The stark visions of prison contrast beautifully with the luminoisity of freedom.
1607;The framing and cinematography are nothing short of breathtaking.
1608;The flawless passage of 19 years during the course of the movie takes us on a lovely journey full of hope, friendship and inspiration.
1609;Truly one of the most signifigant cinematic achievements ever.
1610;a gem to be cherished for years to come.
1611;The sweeping, stirring soundtrack capture the mood of this story perfectly.
1612;a story with an INTELLECTUAL protagonist is soooo refreshing!
1613;the way this movie misleads and surprises the viewer is tremendous.
1614;a man experiences a private Hell, but his spirit remains strong.
1615;Stephen King may be known for horror but I think his greatest stories are those such as the one this movie was based on and 'The Body' which was turned into the movie Stand By Me .
1616;The test of time and consumer spending are far more telling than any award for revealing what films are truly great .
1617;This film has proven to be one of them.
1618;This is arguably the greatest prison film of all time and is worth the time you spend watching it.
1619;I could have watched another two hours of this great film.
1620;I love this movie and (sorry Forest Gump) it should have won Best Picture.
1621;A great adaption from a great author.
1622;Tim Robbins and Morgran Freeman are excellent.
1623;I highly recommend this film to anyone who has yet to see it.
1624;I have seen it twice and I recommend it to all my friends.
1625;will, determination and inner strength.
1626;Morgan Freeman, plays friend and cell mate, Red, represents the rest of us, who are on a journey to discover what made Andy tick.
1627;Both actors put up an excellent performance that keeps one enthralled in the film, wanting to know everything they do, think, and how they develop over the course of their years in prison.
1628;It was subtly presented with maximum impact.
1629;i have read Stephen King's book and I think that this film is a very good film portrayal of his writing with charaters that adhere closely to the book, and are very well.
1630;You must Watch something of substance to tease your intellect and lifts the spirit.
1631;This is the best Non.
1632;A chilling tale of a framed Banker going to a maximum security prison for the murder of his wife and her concubine I reccomend this to anyone witha supreme intellect and a keen spirit.
1633;Cause we are All Andy, Being shackled in the maximum security prison of life maybe one day we will all escape.
1634;This is my favorite movie of all time.
1635;This is one of the movies all others should be compared to!
1636;A story about friendship,freedom,revenge and hope.
1637;his special friendship with Red (Freeman).
1638;It has a brilliant twist in the end.
1639;one of the best work from Stephen King.
1640;Great adaptation from the same name novel.
1641;Even better with the class of actors and the sincerity of this production.
1642;tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfect for their roles and showed great rapport.
1643;frank Darabont's did a marvellous task in putting this intriguing story together.
1644;this movie filled with dark and violence scenes it also depicted vivid prison life.
1645;One of the best movie ever made.
1646;It is definitely on my Top 10, up there with Metropolis and Citizen Kane: amazing character studies, contrasting atmospheres, great cinematography, and terrific editing.
1647;Every frame is, in some way or another, truly heartfelt and carefully handled.
1648;A wonderous piece of modern filmmaking. . .
1649;This is a great movie.
1650;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great.
1651;"Morgan Freeman is a great supporting actor in this movie, must see along with ""The Green Mile"", makes for a great family night."
1652;Yes, as my title says, it IS the best movie ever made to me.
1653;I got trully engaged into this movie.
1654;This is a wonderfully written script.
1655;One of those movies you can watch over and over.
1656;The Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List have a common theme: Using the system to achieve one's goal.
1657;You can accomplish more by working within a system .
1658;"to achieve a desired goal
I:8414;1659;this movie is definitely worth watching more than one time.
I:8414;1660;The film does not drag on"
1661;While watching this film, you will see how Tim Robbins uses the system to his benefit.
1662;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on a stellar performance.
1663;good movie. . . .
1664;good Acting. . . Good Lesson. . . Good fun.
1665;this movie is about a deep emotional relationship between two men.
1666;It is in this context that Dufresne develops his bond with the other lead, Ellis Redding.
1667;"The poster's role in the film is to conceal this opening to the ""sewer,"" to the homosexual escape."
1668;covering includes many types of posters.
1669;albert Einstein, various maps, portraits, landscapes, etc. and that the poster concealing the escape route.
1670;is, suspiciously, unique in its depiction of a sexualized woman.
1671;Keep in mind that up to this point in the film, Andy was happy to use his talents to gain favor within that structure.
1672;In this sense, Andy's payback against Norton carries added meaning.
1673;I liked it because of it's genious storyline.
1674;I love the story line.
1675;I enjoyed Morgan Freeman's nice, pleasurable tone on the narration and I think Tim Robbins plays his part masterfully.
1676;It is very well directed and, even though it goes at a very mellow and slow rate, you never get bored.
1677;The characters are so interesting that you have to know what happens to them.
1678;There are lots of twists and turning points in the story, and the last half hour of this film is the most enjoyable half.
1679;It isn't for everyone, but it is a remarkable film.
1680;This wonderful video (as states) does capture the triumph of the human spirit!
1681;The video is very inspirational to me!
1682;Morgan Freeman shows us that through paitence, we can make the best of any situation.
1683;This video based on a Stephen King story is the best!
1684;I must say seeing this move made me realize that you can find good friends.
1685;you will love the drama and the cast in this movie.
1686;This is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen.
1687;regardless of the time of night or state of mind.
1688;"One of the few films that can be put in the ""All Time Greats"" category."
1689;An emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish and well worth watching again on blue.
1690;One of the reasons I enjoyed this film so much is how well it exemplifies life itself.
1691;Stephen King, who wrote this short novel that the film was based on once said, : The more difficult life becomes, the more the human spirit has a chance to shine .
1692;you can see how the friendship grows between these two inmates and becomes a strong bond for life.
1693;If you are among the significant number of Americans who think this is the best movie ever made .
1694;Seeing it again, still being touched by the story.
1695;It is really a classic that can stand the test of time.
1696;After so many positive reviews already written, some personal observations.
1697;perhaps his mind works better in his home state.
1698;Finally, the movie is totally engrossing, leading to multiple viewings.
1699;Andy wants a small rock hammer to hand make a stone chess set and he also wants a poster of Rita Hayworth for his wall.
1700;Andy is a quiet man but he has a fire that burns within him, an intelligent mind and he has a plan.
1701;this is simply the best conversion of a Stephen King novel to a movie that has been done.
1702;The movie is also one of my all.
1703;time favorites as the storyline, directing and especially the acting is superb.
1704;It is one of Morgan Freeman's and Tim Robbins best roles.
1705;i really liked this movie and I recommend it to you.
1706;I believe that if you haven't seen it then you will enjoy it.
1707;It is entertainment at its best.
1708;This film is truly amazing.
1709;It really shows the ability of the human spirit.
1710;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are flawlessly cast together as true friends and depict real kindred spirits.
1711;the movie is full of rich detail and sound in every scene, it's guaranteed to encompass your attention.
1712;Very few movies have a plot as deep, emotional, and thought.
1713;I recommend this film to any movie buff who can truly understand a film's true meaning.
1714;but also a life lesson you will never forget !
1715;The stills are neat to see, but it'd be nice to control when the photo changes.
1716;It's strange how this movie appeals to so many across race, political and personal boundaries.
1717;The movie has more of an adult theme and I would not recommend for kids.
1718;"I have been hearing great things about this 'classic"" movie since it came out in 1994, but only saw it for the first time recently."
1719;Even the librarian who checked it out for me vouched for it in the strongest terms (women especially seem to love this movie, for some reason).
1720;"For a truly great prison movie, watch ""Cool Hand Luke""."
1721;wary as the new prisoner . . . punished as the victim . . . silent as the watchful one . . . captive as the warden's bookkeeper . . . demeaned as the shoeshine man . . . refined as the classical music lover . . . clever as the master of deception . . . loyal as a friend.
1722;the brilliant Morgan Freeman shines as Red, giving a superlative performance as narrator, prisoner, observer and friend.
1723;The Shawshank Redemption is sure to be listed among the classics.
1724;It was very good acting and an interesting story.
1725;This is the best movie I have ever seen.
1726;I bought the movie so my husband could see it and he agreed with me.
1727;this movie is one of my favorites of all time.
1728;tim robbins and morgan freeman blend fabulously well together with the support of several very good fellow prisoners who's actual names i do not know.
1729;Ultimately, this is a film about the humanity within each of us, and how struggles shape us.
1730;One of the best movies of all time.
1731;Really sounds like fun to me.
1732;On the positive side the classical music scene was excellent.
1733;Beautiful acting, amazing story, that it'll influence anyone who watches this film, to thrive to be a better person!At least, that's how I felt, and I promise you'll feel the same after watching this masterpiece!
1734;Lilke all my friends, I really loved this movie.
1735;Bare with me for a moment if you will.
1736;face but you stood up for her, ever though it meant envoking the wrath of every guy.
1737;the film takes you into .
1738;Yes, this is one of those yummy films.
1739;in it, we can feel the complete desperation of Andy Dufresne(played perfectly by Tim Robbins) and we can see deep into his heart, witnessing his pain, his agony, and helplessness.
1740;"andy meets up with ""Red"" Redding(played magnificently by Morgan Freeman) and soon the two become very good friends."
1741;The cast is electrifying, the plot flawless, and the musical score a complete gem(done handsomely by Thomas Newman).
1742;nOTE: How much do I love this film?
1743;love the movie about a prison break gone right for the right reason with a twist of the books and fiat
1744;This is truely a rare film, where the triumph of the human spirit shines through.
1745;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely superb in this movie and all of the other supporting actors make this film worth watching over and over again.
1746;This was brilliantly adapted from Stephen King's short story, and I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to see a brilliant piece of film making.
1747;What an extraordinary accomplishment this film is.
1748;For starters, it's got Morgan Freeman in it.
1749;And you know I'm right.
1750;He is right and you are all wrong.
1751;There is something in this movie for everyone.
1752;It's a long one but well worth watching.
1753;Probably one of the best movies of this generation.
1754;This movie has touched me like no other.
1755;Tim Robbins' character is beautiful and amazing.
1756;his ability to maintain hope despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles is truly miraculous.
1757;Freeman's portrayal of his institutionalized friend tears your heart apart at times.
1758;The Shawshank Redemption has so many messages of injustice and inhumanity and the ability to love oneself enough to keep faith and transcend the most torturous of circumstances.
1759;This film is a masterpiece.
1760;drama genre with a robust, deeply touching story about courage, friendship, and the persistence of hope amid the regimentation of life in the Big House.
1761;And Freeman brings his own Southern gentility to the role of Red, the wizened con whose bond with Andy takes him to a very unexpected place: the outside world.
1762;Excellent support from James Whitmore, William Sadler, Bob Gunton, and gorgeous camerawork by Roger Deakins makes this crowd.
1763;"pleasing ""Redemption"" song worth hearing more than once."
1764;This is a great story of an innocent man (Tim Robbins) that is sentenced to 2 life terms in prison and his struggle to keep his dignity.
1765;I ordered this as part of a summer project for rainy days.
1766;As it stands however the movie, through the home video market, has found an ever expanding audience that appreciates it's stunning power and beauty.
1767;Great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and storytelling add up to an all.
1768;Unlikely friends provide the backbone for a touching story about 'lifers' in prison.
1769;The characters are believable, the story unforgettable.
1770;The cruel reality of prison life provides a stark contrast to the depth of friendship between two men and their mental triumph over institutional life.
1771;No words can truly describe this incredible film.
1772;I had rated this film as the best film I had ever seen until I saw The Thin Red Line which is another overlooked film and the only film that in my mind surpasses The Shawshank Redemption.
1773;this film explores many fundamental questions about man's human nature and our society in general.
1774;the power of persistence to overcome adversity.
1775;The strength that we gain from each other.
1776;the direction, acting, story, cinematography, and soundtrack are just phenomenal.
1777;This to me is one of very few truly devine films of all time.
1778;SR has developed a huge online following since then, and I've heard plenty of praise for it.
1779;The other reviews elequently describe this masterpiece.
1780;But, I had to add my voice to the choir and proclaim that The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most terrific and uplifting films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.
1781;The characters, story, everything is beautiful.
1782;SR will be regarded as THE defining film of the 90's.
1783;One of the best movies of all time, a must have for your collection!
1784;One of the best screen adaptations of Stephen King's work to date, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most powerful stories told by the grand master of horror, yet not a single ghost or gorey monster appears.
1785;imprisoned man and his struggles with a life destined to be served out in prison.
1786;When The Shawshank Redemption came out in the 90s, I remember a friend telling me how great it is, so I went to see it in theaters.
1787;I loved it so much that I saw it a total of 3 times!
1788;Now my kids love this movie as I do.
1789;if you've never seen this movie then please do yourself a huge favor and watch it!!!
1790;blowing visuals or a fantastic movie that doesn't stimulate your eyes as much as your heart?
1791;In this case, we have one of the most well.
1792;executed films in the history of American cinema formatted for a cutting.
1793;Some outdoor shots look fairly good, but a majority of the scenes will not amaze you.
1794;The packaging and extras are pretty good (although a few of the extras are a little redundant and repeat information), and the movie looks better than it ever has.
1795;I was absolutely mesmerized from start to finish.
1796;True, not all of us pull upon our inner resources, but this movie demonstrates the unalterable truth that there is something deep within us that can get us through anything.
1797;but if you are willing to see it as symbolic and metaphorical of everyday life, I invite you to experience a very wonderful kind of film.
1798;It is absolutely lovely and magnificently crafted.
1799;This one is definitely a hit.
1800;It's no wonder it is IMDB's top rated movie of all time.
1801;Every time I watch this movie I am drained yet positively inspired.
1802;Every time I watch this movie I feel empowered and strengthened.
1803;Every time I watch this movie, I feel a connection between the main characters of this story and my own heart.
1804;While there he suffers through the ins and outs of prison life and yet Andy learns to make the very best of it.
1805;He gives out hope because he still wants to feel normal.
1806;He knows in the back of his soul that hope is the best of things and through hope, anything is possible.
1807;This is an incredible film with a moving story and real, powerful characters.
1808;I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and this is his best performance.
1809;Also Tim Robbins is fantastic.
1810;His stoic and remorseful nature is so subtle and moving.
1811;The film is based on a Stephen King short story and it is written and directed by the writer/director of The Green Mile: Frank Darabont.
1812;In both his sensitive writting and his beautiful shot selection he has created a filmic masterpiece.
1813;I don't usually like talky movies with little action, but I thought that the story and acting were great in this.
1814;This movie is probably my favorite all time.
1815;It's absolutely beautiful, and the fact that it's based on an original story by Stephen King just blows the mind.
1816;I just love everything about it, the story, the music, the superb acting, the direction, everything.
1817;Morgan Freemans protrayal as Red is pure genious.
1818;The music throughout the movie is also done very well, complimenting the scenes perfectly, especially in this last scene.
1819;The story is developed perfectly, and without the long length of the movie the relationship between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins characters would not have been developed well enough to have the effect that it does at the end.
1820;This movie is absolutely amazing.
1821;It's perfect, and is definately my favorite movie of all time!!
1822;It was my favorite movie growing up.
1823;I loved the bond formed between Tim and Morgan's characters and the story the movie told.
1824;why do you Americans need films with happy endings, anyway?Secondly, I loved the fact that we don't know at the start whether Andy is guilty or innocent.
1825;The episodic bit in the middle of the film .
1826;"with the ""kid"" and the overheard jailhouse confession story that proves Andy innocent ."
1827;Forrest gump was a good movie, but not as redeeming as Shawshank.
1828;while both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins had some memorable roles before and after this movie, their roles as Red and Andy, respectively, are career.
1829;The dual story arcs of the prison break, combined with Red's conversion and redemption is a remarkable storytelling achievement.
1830;this movie has personally resonated with me ever since I first saw it nine years ago.
1831;Any time I'm down, I'm able to remember and watch Shawshank and ultimately become inspired and full of hope again.
1832;I'm grateful that this movie was made, and it's easily my favorite movie.
1833;Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie ever.
1834;Film buffs know that this is a movie that comes along maybe once a decade, if that.
1835;It's magical, comprehensive, filled with subplots that all add to the greater story even during the final scene of the film.
1836;A movie that will fill you with hope and joy, and make you cry, not from sadness but from happiness.
1837;Truly a joy, Frank Darabont clearly loves the subject material as do the actors portraying the characters that Stephen King first brought to life with his short novella.
1838;A film that can be viewed multiple times, and given the blu ray treatment, looks fantastic and the book gives it the love and attention it deserves with full color photos of the filmmakers and trivia and information on the production of this one of a kind movie.
1839;ray really adds a new level.
1840;really good movie kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time and the ending is so good
1841;Leonard must be psychic, because no one I've experienced this film with has anticipated its sheer emotional impact.
1842;Easily one of the best films Hollywood has ever released, Shawshank gave voice to anyone who has ever felt cheated, deprived or un.
1843;From its memorable characters and incredible performances, to its shocking ending and impeccable production values, I believe Shawshank will eventually find a comfortable place on everyone's TOP TEN FILMS OF ALL TIME LIST if critics like Maltin really truly understood what an audience needs in order to feel connected and touched.
1844;Disturbing, visceral, audacious yet real, and deeply touchingly grand, Shawshank blew me away.
1845;Other, more celebrated flicks may have their moments, but as a complete whole, this is easily one of the most beautifully realized buddy.
1846;Share it with your kids.
1847;The morals and values that Darabount and his characters deliver are worth their weight in gold.
1848;This movie is worth every penny.
1849;The only thing I can say is the sound and music is better than ever.
1850;Shawshank Redemption is a great movie .
1851;probably one of the best of all time.
1852;up, the content, the aura, and the mood that makes it so great.
1853;Must watch, it is one of the greatest movies ever made!
1854;Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all.
1855;Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!
1856;Probably one of the best films to ever come out in the last 30 or so years.
1857;If you want to see a good film, with a great cast, storyline, and one heck of an ending, than The Shawshank Redemption should certainly be on your list.
1858;"The one movie that stands out for us (above the others) is:The Shawshank RedemptionA modern day version of the classic, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" with its unique story line and plots."
1859;great movie that will appeal movie lovers.
1860;This is the single best movie of all.
1861;i tend to judge books/movies by their covers, but this was actually a real good movie.
1862;I would highly recommend this movie.
1863;There's a reason why this movie prospered on home video: It works as an intimate story.
1864;It has a great, simple theme: That regardless of your circumstances, there's a way out.
1865;Hands down, the best movie ever made.
1866;Incredible acting and beautifully filmed.
1867;Storytelling and directing at it's finest!
1868;Stephen King claims that this is the best film adaptation of one of his stories.
1869;One of the things that make Stephen King a great writer (and I mean this) is that his books are about PEOPLE.
1870;He makes us care about the characters, and then we are frightened when they are put in jeopardy.
1871;The movie, The Shawshank Redemption, succeeds because it is all about the characters .
1872;who they are, and the journey they take.
1873;well, two life sentences, actually.
1874;He forms a friendship with a fellow.
1875;inmate named Red (Morgan Freeman) and uses his own natural resources to create a life for himself.
1876;The ending is changed slightly, but it works for the screen.
1877;Considering the enduring popularity of the piece, it seems most people opt for the former.
1878;Andy's cool attitude and determination capture your heart and get you to feel his pain and dispair.
1879;I strongly recommend this to the strong at heart, for the authenticity of the violence is not for the weak stomach.
1880;This is still one of the best movies if all time.
1881;Lastingly good good good entertainment.
1882;The Shawshank Redemption has to be one of the most powerful movies of all time, the only other film which moved me more than this was Braveheart.
1883;The character portrayal of Red did the book justice and the on going struggle of the characters moved smoothly from one to another.
1884;Has to be Tim Robbins best.
1885;One of the most interesting things about the film is the fact that the main character in the film isn`t Freeman or Robbins but Shawshank itself and the effects it has on each of the inmates and wardens alike.
1886;Probably one of the top 30 greatest films of all time.
1887;Just as with The Green Mile, this is a complete story with satisfying beginning, middle and end, which .
1888;The storyline is excellent and entertaining.
1889;Great story, great characters an very good performances by Robbins and Freeman.
1890;This is an all time classic movie and the cast is terrific.
1891;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are perfect in the lead roles.
1892;the story line, the acting, its just beautiful, I seen it 5 times already, every time I watch it, I can always find something new
1893;Whenever films are being discussed and good films are being discussed The Shawshank Redemption has become a benchmark.
1894;This is what a truly great film and what truly great acting and filmmaking looks like (so rarely seen these days).
1895;If you ever wondered what it is like to be liberated through cinema watch this film and you will understand.
1896;They are almost comforting, like and old friend who stops by to visit from time to time.
1897;I have known true stories much like the ones they tell, making them even more believable and appealing to me.
1898;It is a story of friendship, hope and redemption .
1899;I was also truly impressed with supporting cast members like James Whitmore, who played the old convict Brooks, too thorougly institutionalized to make it on the outside.
1900;tingling musical score or the fact that two of my favorite actors play leading roles.
1901;The sequential order of the film, the choice of all of the characters and the personality that the prison itself takes on have perfected King's (superbly written, by the way) work.
1902;this is without a doubt one of the best films ever made and it truly deserves the high praise it has received.
1903;This is an all time favorite.
1904;The ending is not predictable and yet it is amazing.
1905;Good cast and I really enjoy it.
1906;"Red is the prison bookie, but he also specializes in bringing in goods from the outside ""for a small fee""."
1907;"One of the major themes of Shawshank Redemption is ""A man will do almost anything to keep his mind occupied in prison."""
1908;to me, everything about this film is great.
1909;It's brilliantly cast, has wonderful characters, and comes with a beautiful score to set the mood.
1910;The plot is interesting and realistic, and the dialogue is fascinating.
1911;It also has plenty of humor to offset the sad/depressing events.
1912;"The best movie of 1994 was ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" with ""Pulp Fiction"" a close second."
1913;The sequence in which Andy's secrets are revealed qualifies as one of the five most thrilling movie sequences I have ever watched.
1914;"At the time the movie was seen as a failure because it had not broken even during its theatrical release, but as millions of movie buffs around the world will enthusiastically remind you, ""Shawshank"" honored its message about the value of patience and endurance, by becoming a runaway word."
1915;It holds a place of honor in my collection.
1916;the history reflects la unjustice committed against a inoccent person, making him to be in jail during 20 years.
1917;it is a lesson of living with a deeeply meaning.
1918;This film is remarkable and left me speechless.
1919;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do an outstanding job portraying the characters they were given.
1920;hoping is good thing, we should keep it whatever we are and what we face to.
1921;this is by far my favorite movie of all time (yes, i said of all time).
1922;never have i seen a movie that developed characters so well and MADE you care about them.
1923;Great plot, great screenplay, great cinematography, and terrific acting.
1924;one of the better movies ever made.
1925;This is one of the absolute best movies you will ever see period.
1926;"The Shawshank Redemption is the one of greatest movie I have ever seen, and based off of a short story called ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" it really shows you the talent and genius of Stephen King, one of the GREATEST writers of our time."
1927;Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the Shawshank Redemetion is a real feel good movie but you won't know how good until you reach the end.
1928;Freeman (Red)is a lifer and a survivor who knows the ropes.
1929;Andy,in his quiet way learns how to control and take advantage of situations within the prison along with the friendship he develops with Red.
1930;The acting is superb and it keeps you on your toes until the surprise and wonderful ending.
1931;Tim Robbins was fantastic and Morgan freeman, again, can't be beat.
1932;The twists at the end were especially clever.
1933;Morgan Freeman's character, Red, was an accurate example of a man in prison and his refusal to look for hope.
1934;It was also interesting to see how the once tough.
1935;Some complained of the length, but every minute was interesting and enjoyable.
1936;it's so touching when they meet up in the end!
1937;One of the best movies I have seen in this past decade.
1938;Definitely it deserves the high ratings.
1939;"I was very touched and impressed with the ending, a rather smart, practical and satisfactory ending better than the normal classic revenge of the ""The Monte Cristo"" version."
1940;I loved the movie and I think one ought to have it in his library.
1941;It is one of the best movies of all time!!
1942;It will become one of your favorites, I guarantee it.
1943;It showed and brought to life so many emotional struggles and discoveries.
1944;It to me showed the true power of friendship despite the worlds/systems influences.
1945;must watch film that is truly one of our nations best dramas!
1946;It's one that you can watch over again.
1947;It's definitely one of a kind.
1948;This is is one of my all time favorite movies.
1949;I truly believe this is Tim Robbins' best performance.
1950;and perhaps the same is true of Morgan Freeman.
1951;The film centers on those we encounter in life and assume to be the good versus those who we are predisposed to believe evil.
1952;Overall, it's a good movie.
1953;Definitely entertaining and very uplifting, even made me get teary.
1954;The good guys, though rough on the edges, are still so incredibly good and likable that you are rather unable to imagine them having committed the crimes that they did in order to land in there.
1955;still, it's a good enough movie, it's just not a masterpiece.
1956;It's something you should watch if you need a soulful movie.
1957;"One of the best scenes is when Andy blasts the duettino ""Sull'aria"" from Le Nozze di Figaro over the prison loudspeakers."
1958;It was one of the best Steven King stories ever!
1959;Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are wonderful in this.
1960;will watch again and again and share with our friends.
1961;Can't believe I waited so long to see it.
1962;I'd watch this movie again!
1963;It's classic Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins .
1964;such great chemistry and a story of hope and learning.
1965;It is, by far, one of THE best movies ever made and has withstood the test of time.
1966;"One of the best movie lines ever comes from this movie, ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."""
1967;She's a bit hyper and has always found it hard to sit still for two hours.
1968;Lately (in our old age) she has come around to watching movies with me.
1969;After watching The Shawshank Redemption tonight her opinion: Wow, that may be the best movie I ever saw.
1970;This is one of the best movies ever!
1971;The actors are wonderful and the story superb.
1972;It's long but worth it.
1973;The ending is so satisfying.
1974;It isn't always easy to find the words to describe a great film.
1975;It is just that every ten years or so there is a film that lifts me up and forces me to take a deeper look at some facet of my life, in this case an understanding of value for my own personal freedom.
1976;The Shawshank Redemption feels like a deeply personal film for me.
1977;The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that reflects something real enough that I can almost empathize with its characters for two hours, at least enough that I find a new respect for the life I have.
1978;dimensional perspective on such profound character dynamics.
1979;"It is far more than that
I:8414;1980;Andy is easy to root for as both an innocent man and a fish out of water.
I:8414;1981;His ethics, his honesty, and his moral character are crucial elements to a story taking place in a world of such corruption and guilt.
I:8414;1982;It is beautiful to watch and Robbins is so compelling.
I:8414;1983;Freeman truly becomes the redeemed and in the end he can only find his sense of hope and freedom in the ways that an innocent man, perhaps unwittingly, inspired him.
I:8414;1984;All of sudden it seems everyone is coming out of the woodwork to hail the Shawshank Redemption as one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8414;1985;The movie is emotionally powerful enough that it almost feels like a relative or an old familiar friend up there getting a round of applause and all the credit in the world.
I:8414;1986;This is my all time favorite movie.
I:8414;1987;So he told me to check out The Shawshank Redemption because it was #1 on IMDb, so it has to be good.
I:8414;1988;To add to the clarity, here.
I:8414;1989;The full screen version of this movie includes the soft matte.
I:8414;1990;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8414;1991;It's about a man overcoming the greatest obstacle in his life and never giving up.
I:8414;1992;The acting was perfect and the story was disturbing, compelling and overwhelming.
I:8414;1993;This is the best drama I have ever seen.
I:8414;1994;Morgan and Tim both put up a good show of their talent.
I:8414;1995;It is a must watch.
I:8414;1996;I love the film and the price I paid for it!
I:8414;1997;This is a well made film with fully developed characters.
I:8414;1998;The director takes you on a wonderful journey.
I:8414;1999;I would recommend this film especially for this price I paid $7.99.
I:8414;2000;Other reviewers have probably done a better job of explaining why.
I:8414;2001;All I know is that the visuals are superb.
I:8414;2002;Morgan Freeman is probably the best actor around, and Tim Robbins is one of my favorites as well as extremely underrated.
I:8414;2003;This is one of the few movies that my husband and I both love and that we watch over and over.
I:8414;2004;There is something new to discover each time it is viewed.
I:8414;2005;The characters are so well written and acted.
I:8414;2006;They and the plot blend seamlessly to create an undeniable masterpiece.
I:8414;2007;This movie is absolutely amazing.
I:8414;2008;This one hits you in the heart.
I:8414;2009;I have seen this movie about 30 times, mainly because TNT shows it every two weeks.
I:8414;2010;We also realize that Andy's calm, quiet exterior hides a great reserve of patience and fortitude, and Red comes to admire this mild.
I:8414;2011;Overall I think this is one of the most entertaining movies of all time and has one of the best endings ever recorded on film.
I:8414;2012;This is an incredible movie, you must get this one, tim robbins is accused of murdering his wife and is sent to shawshank prison for life, trouble is hes innocent, as red (morgan freeman) points out hey were all innocent in here.
I:8414;2013;What andy dufresne (tim robbins)has to go through to survive prison life is incredible, the movie gradually builds up to a gripping climax and one hell of a supprise ending .
I:8414;2014;YES get this movie its well acted both stars play there parts really good,to the point you may think is this based on a real event?
I:8414;2015;It is a deep story that searches for justice.
I:8414;2016;Powerful movie worthy to be called number one movie of all time.
I:8414;2017;Product recieved in a timely manner without any complications.
I:8414;2018;Excellent movie I highly recommend it.
I:8414;2019;I generally don't like prison flicks but this one is a must see.
I:8414;2020;After having my arm twisted into watching it, I was surprised by this film.
I:8414;2021;It speaks of keeping hope and faith through adversity.
I:8414;2022;It has a delightful cast.
I:8414;2023;It has a fantastic plot with a surprise ending that you'll love.
I:8414;2024;There are both poignant and light hearted moments.
I:8414;2025;By far, my favorite movie of all time.
I:8414;2026;Great story, great characters, great twists, great cast .
I:8414;2027;After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town.
I:8414;2028;what happens next , you will just have to watch !
I:8414;2029;in fact, I am most confident that you will enjoy this one.
I:8414;2030;I am a very satisfied customer.
I:8414;2031;The Shawshank Redemption tops many """"favorite movie"""" lists, and for good reason."""
2032;The movie is entertaining, touching, and always a treat to watch.
2033;The product came quickly and well packaged, for an excellent price.
2034;I believe this to be one of the finest movies ever made.
2035;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give highly nuanced performances in a script written for the ages.
2036;You find yourself with a better understanding of the community within prisons from years ago, how institutionalized people can be and also how terrifying freedom can be after so many years within the walls.
2037;he rated it as one of two nest movies ever seen.
2038;Good movie for a stay home date
2039;This film sticks in my mind as one of the best movies I've seen for several reasons, but primarily because of the outstanding character and plot development.
2040;All the inmates respect Red, including Andy, who feels completely out of place in the prison world.
2041;as the film progresses the audience is captivated by the developing relationship between Red and Andy.
2042;"We watch them grow together and we can see the impact that they have on each other
I:8414;2043;The development of the characters draws us in.
I:8414;2044;we feel personally connected to them and as twists in the story take place we are anxious to see what happens to each of these characters.
I:8414;2045;as the story draws the audience in, we wonder just what will happen next.
I:8414;2046;plots emerge, including the story of one elderly prisoner who is released back into a world he hardly knows.
I:8414;2047;The overall dynamics of the storyline are so engaging that at the end of the film it is difficult to find closure.
I:8414;2048;this film is engaging, cleverly worked together, and wonderfully developed.
I:8414;2049;Superb acting and an engrossing storyline are finely knit together to produce this masterpiece.
I:8414;2050;I've seen this one several times and finally bought it to keep at home.
I:8414;2051;Great story, great ending, great actors.
I:8414;2052;My husband and I enjoy watching frequently.
I:8414;2053;It's a great movie that shows perseverance of one person who was wrongly convicted of a crime and spent 20 years in jail.
I:8414;2054;It's a good example of what goes around, comes around and that good usually wins out in the end.
I:8414;2055;If you have not seen this movie I highly recommend it.
I:8414;2056;I HAD to see what happened, so I went out and bought it.
I:8414;2057;it is a much cleaner version.
I:8414;2058;The actors in this movie are perfect for their parts.
I:8414;2059;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8414;2060;Everyone should definitely see this movie!!
I:8414;2061;The movie always has the unexpected,
I:8414;2062;It was a gift, and was excitedly received.
I:8414;2063;our favorite its time to start living or time to start dying.
I:8414;2064;Not only is the movie an excellent story, but it is blessed with superior acting.
I:8414;2065;The SR is one of my favorite movies.
I:8414;2066;The tale that this movie weaves about justice, injustice, redemption and just deserts was done marvelously.
I:8414;2067;Morgan Freeman's voice draws you in and captivates you.
I:8414;2068;And this was Tim Robbins best performance ever.
I:8414;2069;It is the best prison drama ever made.
I:8414;2070;I just thought it was going to be a touching story about friendship.
I:8414;2071;tim Robbins' character epitomizes the type of individual who usually succeeds in life.
I:8414;2072;Not only is he gifted with above average intelligence, but he has an amazing work ethic.
I:8414;2073;Our lives are a gift that comes with good and bad, but in the end we *do* have the power to make our own destiny.
I:8414;2074;i'm choosing an angle when I recommend this film.
I:8414;2075;Resourceful Andy has also been secretly working for years on a wild escape plan.
I:8414;2076;with all the prison cruelty, this is a very painful movie to watch, but it has a hopeful and heartwarming ending.
I:8414;2077;Robbins and Freeman have a great chemistry and are a pleasure to watch.
I:8414;2078;James Whitmore has a small but touching role as a convict who gets released after spending most of his life behind bars.
I:8414;2079;Although there are many scenes that make me cringe, I do like the movie and heartily recommend it.
I:8414;2080;fest"""" but when I did see it, I found it to be one of the best movies I have ever seen."""
2081;Probably one of my favorites of all time.
2082;and who can ever possibly forget the King of Hank Williams lovesick blues singin', multitalented and underrated veteran actor William Sadler, recently seen in the equally underrated The Battle of Shaker Heights and soon to play in the anticipated Wonderfalls dramedy on Fox?I love this movie and its observations on life, love, justice, and yes, redemption.
2083;The Shawshank Redemption easily ranks among the best prison films I have ever seen.
2084;And is a running contender for one of the best dramas I have ever seen.
2085;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman absolutely shine and is easily one of the best movies in both of their long line of film credits.
2086;the movie really brings a message of hope and friendship and a good understanding of life behind bars.
2087;1960's) An excellent movie with an excellent message.
2088;"One of those ""take what you can from it"" films that really stands out."
2089;Oh well, maybe a SE on the horizon?Pick this one up and see two very talented actors at their very best.
2090;"I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and found it to be an inspiring movie."
2091;time favorites, written by Stephen Kingand masterfully directed by Frank Darabont.
2092;i am a proud owner of this movie on BD.
2093;"the picture looks damn good
I:8414;2094;every time I am up for a movie in a category with this movie comes up in my mind I go ahead and put it in, it definitely is riveting and capturing to watch every scene of it.
I:8414;2095;:)All hail Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins' outstanding performances that were Oscar.
I:8414;2096;Great performances by Freeman and Robbins.
I:8414;2097;Great story telling made intensely more effective with Freeman's narration.
I:8414;2098;Characters you can truly empathize with.
I:8414;2099;The Shawshank Redemption was a very strong and powerful movie.
I:8414;2100;This movie displays one mans triumph (Red, played by Morgan Freeman) of life through finding hope, given to him from a friend(Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins) while they were in jail.
I:8414;2101;The other main point is about freedom.
I:8414;2102;Andy demonstrates that freedom is beautiful for being wrongfully accused and finally escaping Shawshank (as well as basically overthrowing it)and living his days out in the tropical sweetness of mexico.
I:8414;2103;some say this is the best movie ever.
I:8414;2104;But I can with certainty say that this movie was certainly an amazing movie with an amazing cast and not the least that this movie was only made over a book from one of the best authors on this planet, Steven King.
I:8414;2105;I highly recommend this film and also recommend that anyone who is slightly interested after reading this check it out.
I:8414;2106;Excited to add this classic movie to my collection.
I:8414;2107;Highly recommend it to anyone
I:8414;2108;This is an excellent movie!
I:8414;2109;It has an excellent moral, and an excellent surprise ending.
I:8414;2110;i recommend it for men and women, although you might want to watch the age of children viewing this show.
I:8414;2111;adults, enjoy the story of friendship, lies, and the redemption of an innocent man.
I:8414;2112;This is one of the rare movie that is enjoyed by me.
I:8414;2113;Honestly, I love to watch action packed movies like """"The Last Stand"""", """"Taken"""", """"Taken 2"""", """"Unknown"""" etc."""
2114;The story line is good and the pace is fast without slowing down.
2115;Tim Robbin and Morgan Freeman gives a very excellant performance too.
2116;Repeat viewing will let one appreciate the movie more.
2117;Stephen King's The Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest movies made in the last 25 years.
2118;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb in their roles as lifers at Shawshank, a prison which is run by an iron fisted but crooked warden.
2119;The Shawshank Redemption is actually a actor about dignity, forgiveness and personal freedom and it is a Must.
2120;see movie for every human over the age of 12.
2121;A true piece for the movie collection.
2122;Shipped quickly, movie worked great in the blue ray.
2123;This has to be one of the best movies ever made.
2124;One of my all time favorites!
2125;It was on time and in perfect shape.
2126;Oh yeah, it's a good movie too.
2127;Many great things have been said about this movie, and the movie deserves it.
2128;This Stephen King prison tale is excellent (as is his other prison tale The Green Mile).
2129;this movie is my all time favorite movie .
2130;"I absolutely love the story
I:8414;2131;technically it's a good movie, nothing to blow your skirts up, but most definitely worthwhile.
I:8414;2132;i can highly recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8414;2133;I love this movie and could watch it all day.
I:8414;2134;It is one of Stephen Kings best movies in my opinion.
I:8414;2135;came as stated and packaged perfectly.
I:8414;2136;this movie is great and for the price .
I:8414;2137;The masterful way the story is unfolded through a mixture of real time, flashback and narration by Red (Morgan Freeman) keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end .
I:8414;2138;His expressive face is always a pleasure to watch.
I:8414;2139;Every track of Thomas Newman's soundtrack is evocative and haunting.
I:8414;2140;No other movie I've ever seen can touch Shawshank Redemption for consistent excellence and thorough attention to detail.
I:8414;2141;bottom line: everyone who took part in the making of this film should feel deeply proud of what they produced, and everyone who wants to feel the power of human hope and friendship should see it.
I:8414;2142;I've tried to think of another film that I thought was as compelling and meaningful and the closest I can come is """"The Best Years of Our Lives."""""""
2143;This is by far, one of the best films I've seen in quite some time!
2144;if you liked The Green Mile you'll love this movie too.
2145;This is the type of movie that stays with you after you have watched it.
2146;I was very pleased with the condition and the timely fashion that I received my movie.
2147;All movies are better on Blu.
2148;Definitely worth the price, especially since you get the book full of info.
2149;The experience is moving, and when you watch it from beginning to end, you'll have something to think about for a while.
2150;Its upbeat message will pull you in all directions, and then eventually bring warmth to your soul.
2151;Within two months of his sentence, he meets friends, such as Red, who make up the little prison family that Andy grows accustom to.
2152;Through his experiences, you'll see first.
2153;You're always kept thinking, and if anything you'll be entertained, until the rousing climax.
2154;And no movie's ending has ever captivated me as much as this one's has.
2155;At its heart is a deeply moving, heart.
2156;warming experience about friendship and hope.
2157;This movie is powerful and touching for anyone.
2158;I cannot say enough good things about the storyline and, having read the novella many times, the adaptation is true to the plot.
2159;This is a film that might not seem to be a good date film on the surface, but would actually be the perfect mix of the emotional as well as the physical side of movie.
2160;It's just the kind of movie that gives you goosebumps, gives you teary eyes and makes you want to clap!
2161;THis movie is just incredible.
2162;Frank darabont did a fantastic job of transfering this king novella to the sliver screen.
2163;He is sentenced to to life terms, when he enter's the prison he mets up with a con named Red ( wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman), Red doesn't think very much of Andy at the begining of the film but over time he learns that underneaath Andy's meek surface lies patience and courage enough for ten men.
2164;superbly acted an directed this is a movie for any one who claims to like movies, a must own.
2165;Morgan Freemans narration is so spectacular and right on key that I think he should've won an Oscar just for his narration of this movie.
2166;A fine,fine,masterpiece of a movie.
2167;nothing that year or since has matched the greatness of this motion picture.
2168;It is still as great as when it was first released.
2169;Obviously Shawshank is the best movie of all time.
2170;"yet each time i see it, it is more captivating
I:8414;2171;the relationship between Red and Dufresne is one of the most intimate and honest in recent film, yet it is interesting how Andy, who seems to know everyone else, is really a mystery"
2172;Extremely powerful film and definitely a must.
2173;Unforgettable performances both by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.
2174;This is the kind of movie which will inspire you time and time again.
2175;This story never grows old and the characters represented here give 'hope' for the world and for all of us as humans living together.
2176;very inspiring and the acting is superb.
2177;gives you faith in keeping ahold of your own identity no matter what is going on around you.
2178;The music is one of the reasons I have loved it so much.
2179;The composer, Thomas Newman, also did The Horse Whisperer, which had the same kind of haunting, gorgeous music throughout it too.
2180;It helps to tell the story and is, in my opinion, perfect.
2181;This is because the story is so inspirational and moving, that by the end, you forget about those bad times.
2182;It examines and is a testament to the human spirit, and is told/portrayed so well that the end result is powerful.
2183;The good times consist of the friendships between the men in the prison and the way they try to still hope and have good lives dispite of their situations.
2184;The times in the movie when he quietly, but at the same time loudly, defies the corrupt authority at the prison are very moving.
2185;There is a scene where he broadcasts an opera record over the intercome of the prison, then everyone stops and listens, its really a beautiful moment and a powerful thought, that every human has to have hope to keep going in life.
2186;This thought is the driving force of the movie and is worked to perfection.
2187;His performance is just as good and his character just as important to the story as Robbins'.
2188;The deep friendship between the two of them is another driving force for this movie.
2189;These two exceptional actors make this movie a real stand out in the films over the years.
2190;bottom line, this is a wonderful piece of cinema that I am glad is so highly acclaimed and remembered.
2191;It ranks very high up there in my favorites of all time.
2192;This movie is one every adult should see.
2193;it has a great cast, great acting, based on a true story which makes it even that more awesome!
2194;It has action, suspense, drama and has humor to boot.
2195;Gives you a glimpse into prison life that will stay with you forever.
2196;One of the best movies of all time!
2197;One of our family favorites .
2198;Excellent acting and great message !
2199;This copy was bought as a gift for a nephew.
2200;The moving life of Andy Dufrane entered my life two years ago.
2201;Tim Robbins went beyond an actor and truly transformed into the quiet, well.
2202;This movie touches the heart, especially when Andy is roughed up by the 'sisters' and when he befriends 'Red'.
2203;There are hundreds of reviews about The Shawshank Redemption in general, and its place as one of the finest movies ever filmed.
2204;I do love the movie, don't get me wrong.
2205;And I'm pleased that it vaulted right into the #72 spot in the new revised listing.
2206;still, with that all being said, clearly the movie is incredibly well done and well worth watching.
2207;The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made.
2208;The acting is incredible, the characters are great, and the story is gripping.
2209;Tim Robbins, who plays the main character, Andy Dufresne, does an incredible job.
2210;He plays the heroic role of Andy to perfection, gaining the audience's sympathy and respect, while capturing their hearts with every step his character takes.
2211;While Robbins is great, though, Morgan Freeman is the one who steals the show in my eyes.
2212;"His narration adds a lot to the movie, as does his overall portrayal of Ellis ""Red"" Redding."
2213;Together, Freeman and Robbins have incredible chemistry, and make for one of the best on.
2214;the story is a great one.
2215;When you watch this one to the end, you'll have an appreciation for the realism that was presented within the film.
2216;"this movie isn't just for those who enjoy prison movies
I:8414;2217;The Shawshank Redemption is a great one, folks"
2218;It is admittedly short on features, but the picture is incredibly crisp and clear, and the sound comes through brilliantly.
2219;This movie I gave as a gift to a friend.
2220;It has a great and interesting story, it's directing delivers powerful emotions that will suck you in.
2221;You will feel the pain joy distress and true happiness during this movie.
2222;The acting in it is all far above par, some of the actors giving their best performances in their life.
2223;It looks great on blueray, and I don't even have to look at the other comments before posting this to know its gonna be nothing but tons of 5s.1994 was an amazing year for movies.
2224;This is easily as good a movie as forest gump (in my opinion better), and if you don't own it, you should fix that RIGHT NOW.
2225;The is my boyfriends favorite movie and I am a huge fan now too.
2226;the shawshank redemption is one of the best movies of all time, rated 9 out of 10 on imdb.
2227;"this movie gives people hope, the tagline of the movie is ""fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"" and this movie does, it tells the story of one man, well i wont tell you the plot, but it is good."
2228;the score on this movie is also very good.
2229;well there are my thoughts, i highly recomend the movie.
2230;It is one of the few films I can watch over and over and, except for a few harrowing scenes (which are nonethless essential to the story) I enjoy each time.
2231;The story is inspirational, the writing is crisp and the cinematography is superb.
2232;If anyone had told me, before I'd first seen this movie, that a film set in a prison would become one of my all time favorites, I'd have thought them insane, but it is that good.
2233;Nice to have it in blu.
2234;Good price but wish it also had the digital copy included.
2235;This movie is by far my favorite for a number of reasons.
2236;The actors (going for realism to provoke emotion) were superb.
2237;I tip my hat to both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman for their outstanding performances.
2238;I also believe that the simple atmosphere set for this movie added to it's authenticity a great deal.
2239;It was a beautifully written story that thankfully translated beautifully to the big screen.
2240;(Most Stephen King stories don't fare so well in film version.)
2241;This was a film with incredible performances by Tim Robbins and the wonderful Morgan Freeman, the supporting cast was great.
2242;The movie remained true to the book which was important to the story.
2243;It was a great film.
2244;I have seen this three times and it gets better every time.
2245;As much as I can't stand Tim Robbins, he does a very nice job here.
2246;This is one of Morgan Freemen's finer if not finest works.
2247;I must have watched this movie 5 times and its really a great movie.
2248;Tim and Morgan should be awarded an OSCAR for doing such a great job.
2249;This was a sleeper at the box office, however, it's one of Morgan Freeman's best movies.
2250;It has been a week since I saw this movie for the first time, and it still has lingered with me.
2251;I am an avid Stephen King reader and fan.
2252;I had read the novella, and very much enjoyed it.
2253;Very rarely, are the movies based on books enjoyed at the same level as the books, because one cannot simply film a book.
2254;One of the best things about this movie, is the fact that it makes you share these feelings with the characters.
2255;tim Robbins has given one of the finest performances I have ever seen in an American movie.
2256;Morgan Freemans performance and narration are top notch as well.
2257;The building in it of itself is amazing, bursting at the seems with history.
2258;I appreciate the prision a lot more now, and feel grateful that I live so close so that I can make another trip this summer.
2259;It has made it's way into my top 5 movies of all time list.
2260;It will take your breath away, and make you stop for a minute and just appreciate everything you have.
2261;what can I say . . . great movie, and absolutely fantastic service from Amazon.
2262;Great movie about a situation that could change people forever in negative or positive I see it as moving forward with the best results to look forward after something bad happens.
2263;It is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story and was nominated for 7 Oscars.
2264;It has also garnered a perfect 5.
2265;Great movie based on a Stephen King story.
2266;The Shawshank Redemption definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies of all.
2267;It is an excellent movie that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a bank manager who has been convicted of murdering his wife and sent to serve out a life sentence in Shawshank prison.
2268;overall, with the great story, good casting and acting, and an interesting soundtrack, the Shawshank Redemption is a classic movie that should not be missed.
2269;Highly recommended for anyone as it tells a great story about life, struggle, and redemption.
2270;The movie by itself is one of a kind!
2271;One interesting thing about this movie is that it occasionally shows up as the #1 movie on lists of the 100 top movies of all time.
2272;a movie that many people probably wouldn't have thought of for that rarefied honor.
2273;It's one of my favorite movies, and one of the few movies I have been able to watch more than once.
2274;For me, that's extremely rare and is another indication of how good the movie really is.
2275;The movie has a great story, great acting by Robbins and Freeman, and a great ending.
2276;This is without any doubt one of the best stories I have ever come across.
2277;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game.
2278;The entire cast is outstanding.
2279;There have been many excellent reviews of the award winning movie, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.
2280;a hope, which in the end was dramatically depicted through his courageous escape.
2281;This has to be one of my favorite movies.
2282;It is a great movie of hope and prison life.
2283;He goes to prison and meets friends and wants to make them happy, so he gives the warden some financial tips, if he can give his Co. workers some beer.
2284;I highly reccomend this great movie.
2285;classic, The Shawshank Redemption with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, and it doesn't show any signs of aging, much like the soul of the main character, played by Robbins, who remained intact through his tenure in the Shawshank prison in spite of having been locked away for life (for two life terms, actually, something I've always had a hard time understanding.)
2286;The script is simply brilliant (can't give much away without spoiling it for those readers who still haven't had the privilege of watching it).
2287;this movie will be close to my heart always and it is one that I can recommend with my eyes closed once and again.
2288;The shawshank redemption is a brilliant film that is beautifly acted with and insiring and uplifting message message of hope.
2289;A journey into the world of a true hero.
2290;Astonishingly moving and uplifting drama about a successful banker (Tim Robbins) who wrongfully receives two back.
2291;It became a phenomenon back in 1994, and here it is again, on an impressive 2.
2292;com's readers have voted this the second best movie of all time, behind only The Godfather.
2293;That's pretty impressive company right there.
2294;Then by the onset of the third act, I was completely engrossed by phenomenal acting and directing, unexpected friendships by the characters, and a satisfying finale (don't worry, I didn't give away anything).
2295;This is a very extraordinary movie.
2296;Watch it, if you haven't yet.
2297;she said it was one of her favorite movie, so as a loving husband IBought it for her not knowing anything about it.
2298;Perfect characters of Robbins and Freeman and the end is one of the most amazing in movie's history.
2299;Highly recommended for any kind of crowd.
2300;One of the best stories I've ever seen.
2301;Emotional, human and the best friend relation.
2302;Of course, if you've seen the movie, you know it's good.
2303;ray makes it come to life even more!
2304;It's a rarity in the movie world that a movie can take you on the emotional rollercoaster that The Shawshank Redemption takes you on.
2305;It's unquestionably the greatest movie of all time, for a variety of reasons.
2306;Bob Gunton as the Warden gave a steller performance, as he truly made you hate his guts in convincing fashion.
2307;The movie is an example of a wonderful friendship and exciting story.
2308;Well acted, interesting story that hold ones attention tightly until the end.
2309;Although, there were few squiggly, tense scenes the majority of the move is touching.
2310;The was a really good movie and I enjoyed it.
2311;I will probably watch it again and also loan it to other friends to watch.
2312;Andy's spirit is kept alive and because of it he does indeed survive.
2313;the actors in this movie are great.
2314;Morgan Freeman and Tm Robbins both do absolutely fantastic job.
2315;We all know Shawshank is one of the best movies of all time, and many of the reviewers have well.
2316;release Shawshank to give it the glory it is entitled to and give Shawshank's many fans a better product.
2317;It is highly dramatic and starkly graphic, conveying a sense of injustice and ocaasional despair.
2318;It has a fitting ending though.
2319;If you want my advice, this is simply the best film you will probably see.
2320;spend part of a Sunday afternoon in front of your tv and turn it up!
2321;if that's not an instant disqualifier for you it is also one of the best movies you'll ever see.
2322;"ahead of Casablanca and everything but ""The Godfather"", but it's still a dang good thing to watch."
2323;tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne is that rarity of a prison inmate .
2324;But Andy has intelligence and patience, and much of the film is about how Andy comes to gain the respect of his fellow inmates as well as the Warden.
2325;"morgan Freeman is wonderful as Red, a prison ""Lifer"" who carries the weariness of his life matter."
2326;I'd love to tell you the story, but that would detract from the pleasure of discovering it yourself.
2327;you just KNOW it's going to be good.
2328;(Shawshank is a favorite among everyone I know who has seen it.)
2329;That guy should write some more!
2330;According to Red, Andy's friend, everyone is innocent at Shawshank.
2331;Red thought, hope and the dream of freedom was a pipe dream.
2332;Andy, believed and had faith in his future.
2333;After a while, prisoners at Shawshank accepted their lot in life, stopped dreaming, and eventually even feared the prospect of being paroled.
2334;Many become institutionalized and begin to feel comfortable, secure, and even dependent in their personal prisons.
2335;Their prison could be a job or circumstance that they just accept as their lot in life and give up hope.
2336;He made friends and alliances, even with prison guards in order to advance his plan for freedom.
2337;Andy kept his hope and dreams alive and made the best of his present situation while learning from his past.
2338;I remember those words as clear a bell.
2339;I gained my freedom .
2340;A year later I broke out my wife and we have enjoyed our freedom for the last15 years.
2341;This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time.
2342;Robbins and Freeman are excellent and their characters' friendship (essentially the core of this movie) makes it worth watching repeatedly.
2343;A classic Stephen King novel shown with a great deal of style and substance.
2344;Tim Robbins along with Hank William Seniors great musical style.
2345;He soars when Hank is played!
2346;It is one of my favorites.
2347;A nice addition to my movie collection.
2348;A movie about hope and true friendship.
2349;It's a bit on the long side, but it is well worth it.
2350;There's a lot of things to say about The Shawshank Redemption.
2351;One is: It is simply the best movie ever made!
2352;I'm still trying to figure out why so many people absolutely LOVE this film and think it's the best ever and why it inspires such fierce loyalty.
2353;or maybe I just need to be more emotionally in need of inspiration and hope in order to get this remarkable film.
2354;It's small, I should have ordered a larger one.
2355;i ordered it for my husband and he likes it very much.
2356;This movie is one of the best I have ever seen.
2357;Tim Robbins is intelligent in every movie he does, but this one is at the height of his career.
2358;He befriends Morgan Freeman, a man that knows the streets and the ins and outs.
2359;Their friendship provides strength to get through the many years they serve in prison.
2360;Excellent movie, excellent ending, a must have.
2361;It has been added to my own personal blockbuster!
2362;Such a good story, except there's no con alive who would take new evidence to the warden as Andy did .
2363;And since Stephen King didn't develop trust between Andy and the Warden, this story line make NO sense.
2364;I got the movie in no time and it was a great Christmas gift for my boyfriend.
2365;expected something way more violent and jaw dropping, but was incredulous at the grace, beauty and message within this movie.
2366;Though violent, it is A story on the survival of the human spirit.
2367;I saw it a couple of years ago and I did enjoy it as it has a great storyline.
2368;a long movie, but worth the dedication to sit and watch it.
2369;phenominal acting, great writing, and an ending that makes you want to and actually sprint out and take a victory lap around the block.
2370;If you haven't seen it, get over it and watch and enjoy.
2371;Watch it and you'll see.
2372;This is my favorite movie not only for its creation of a vivid, enthralling microcosm, but for the profound wisdom of its theme.
2373;This film translates the heart of King's message with wonderful fluidity and fills characters otherwise left to the imagination with actors perfect for their roles.
2374;Morgan Freeman and Time Robbins are undeniably convincing, and the often brutal and savage aspects of their prison life are counterbalanced by the humanity with which they embrace their roles.
2375;This film is truly great.
2376;It portrays how the human spirit has the ability to transcend the ugliness which can so often imprison the soul.
2377;It is a superb story of suffering, hope and the strength of unwavering determination.
2378;The Shawshank Redemtion is a compelling and gripping movie.
2379;if you want a film that is made for those who enjoy a deeper meaning in what they watch, not just big men running around shooting things or crazed serial killers that have come back from the dead to exact some revenge, I highly recommend seeing this film.
2380;i can honestly say it is the best motion picture my eyes have had the honor to see.
2381;Another Stephen King masterpiece that receives just the right touch on the big screen.
2382;The movie is extremely faithful to the short novel, and the few departures are just right.
2383;Everyone does a good job with the acting, and the dramatic prison escape in the ending is tear.
2384;Overall, though, this is a good movie that has something to say.
2385;This film was touching and amazing!
2386;Great film for any cinema lover or anyone wanting to see a good film in general!
2387;It's perfect in every way, shape and form.
2388;Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins both give outstanding performances.
2389;Frank Darabont writes a wonderful script and directs a terrific film.
2390;It's many stories, many characters and many films all condensed into the best 140 minutes I have ever experienced.
2391;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
2392;One of my most favorite movies of all time.
2393;Sound and picture were absolutely fabulous!
2394;Despite a fairly formulaic plot, based on a Stephen King book, it's still a great movie.
2395;It allows the plot to advance without actual acting.
2396;I'd heard for a while that this was a good movie.
2397;This is an incredible film.
2398;I was incredibly moved by the soul of this film.
2399;The story is so human and has so many themes that made me reflect on my life.
2400;I bawled during and after viewing the film.
2401;And the director has crafted a riveting film.
2402;There are times you really wander What the heck is going to happen next?
2403;, which is quite amazing for a prison film.
2404;This is a smart film that tells a soulful story.
2405;There are great twists and turns that the main characters go through.
2406;And the truths at the heart of this film are expressed simply and with care.
2407;Well, it's finally here and it is received with mixed emotions.
2408;Still, though it is nice to have a permanent copy of the greatest movie ever made, finally.
2409;Every decade has a film that stands out.
2410;I believe that The Shawshank Redemption is such a film.
2411;The soundtrack is excellent with subtlety and remarkable detail.
2412;Saw the movie before and want to see it again.
2413;One of the best movies of all time.
2414;A+ acting and great story.
2415;I recommend this to everyone.
2416;Most people rate this movie at the top of their favorites.
2417;Worthy of keeping in a collection of favorites that you can watch every couple of years.
2418;This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2419;It shows us the values of hope, friendship, and patience.
2420;The characters are so well developed and have a way of evoking intense emotion.
2421;Some you will love others you will despise.
2422;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb!!
2423;I do beleive it is my all time favorite!
2424;I thought it was well written and the actors did a 5 star performance.
2425;This is a great movie to have in any collection.
2426;time favorite films even having seen it several times already.
2427;The story is compelling, and tells of a man, Andy Dufresne, wrongfully convicted and committed for a murder he did not do, but he uses his intellect and the help of a friend he made in prison to survive and even in some ways thrive within the system.
2428;In the end, Andy has to rely on himself and his intellect along with what he has accomplished in prison to beat the system.
2429;this is a solid, stellar film which I cannot recommend enough.
2430;I have experienced this movie about 10 times on VHS, and I laugh, cry and fall more in love with this movie with every viewing.
2431;While some movies lack in certain catagories, Shawshank Redemption is perfectly written and directed, the casting is perfect, the acting is perfect, the cinematography is perfect and any other catagory I am forgetting is perfect.
2432;Ask anyone who has seen the movie, and the worst response you will ever get is that was a very good movie!
2433;The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever had the priviledge of viewing.
2434;This movie had all the components to make an excellent classic.
2435;Robbins and Freeman prove great allies and friends in this movie.
2436;Unlike other films I truly believed these two had a genuine friendship.
2437;The story continues as the man continues through his years in prison and eventually his unconventional way of getting out.
2438;i recommend that everyone who loves great films should see this movie.
2439;It will renew your faith in the human spirit.
2440;One of the best pictures I've ever seen.
2441;Undoubtedly, a major gem that will never be forgotten.
2442;Morgan Freeman was especially funny in this movie.
2443;I enjoyed his role playing the friend of our shy banker.
2444;Robbins gives a good performance here.
2445;He still speaks through his teeth.
2446;Morgan Freeman steals almost every scene.
2447;He has developed his craft like an old master.
2448;He is one of todays best actors and I believe he is still very underrated.
2449;He can easily carry a starring role with no problem.
2450;Guntons's performance works because he is evil but still adds some good qualities deep inside.
2451;Way deep, deep, deep inside.
2452;The length is necessary as the story is about the passage of time in prison.
2453;As the picture begins, the helicopter shot of the prison passing below along with the scoring is picture perfect.
2454;My favorite shot is another helicopter shot of Red and Andy after they are released from prison.
2455;He also tells Red to go to a spot where He's left some money for Red.
2456;As the two men lay eyes on each other the music is playing and the shot pulls back further and further.
2457;Just two old friends embracing each other as the copter shot pulls back further still.
2458;We are seeing the story through his character's remembrances so it's appropriate.
2459;There is some prison stereotype behavior but it is easily overlooked in this well acted drama.
2460;They are stories of survival, survival of the fittest.
2461;What you have got to remember is Violence is a fact of life.
2462;If you want to do a movie, you would want to depict it as true to life as you possibly can.
2463;all that aside, the movie is spectacular.
2464;in the opinion of this film critic it is a must see.
2465;I liked this very much.
2466;This is my all time favorite movie it is a Classic!
2467;The acting was excellent, and the story line was executed beautifully.
2468;Morgan's character Red is a savvy businessman in his own way, and part of what keeps him alive and respected in prison.
2469;Every scene is well worth the time to watch.
2470;The music more than fits the movie.
2471;This Oscar nominated movie is defintly one to add to your collection.
2472;it's a bit unusual considering it's a Stephen King movie, yet it's my personal favorite of all movies based on Stephen King's writings.
2473;Very few movies capture the triumph of the human spirit as memorably as The Shawshank Redemption.
2474;That is definetely a true statement!
2475;To tell you the truth, The Shawshank Redemption really moved me.
2476;Personally, I thing Morgan Freeman gives the best performance in this movie hands down!
2477;Tim Robbins was great too, but something about Morgan's performance really makes you understand and feel for him deeply.
2478;Frank Darabont (in his directorial debut) did a stunning job directing this film.
2479;But if anyone gets a chance to read this review (who hasn't seen the movie) please give it a chance!
2480;Back in 2000, my high school religion teacher had our class write a paper that we had to base on one of a few movies with religious themes.
2481;"On his recommendation, I chose to watch ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" and since then, it has turned into my favorite movie of all time."
2482;i am not usually a big Tim Robbins fan, but he does a fantastic job playing Andy Dufresne, a banker who has to adjust to life in prison after being wrongfully convicted in the deaths of his wife and her lover.
2483;In my opinion, his portrayal of Andy is easily his greatest performance to date.
2484;The movie also features Morgan Freeman, who may be one of the greatest actors of his generation, as the felon named Red who is serving a life sentence and quickly becomes enamored with Andy and his easy.
2485;Perhaps the best part of the movie is that they also manage to use Freeman as the narrator, and he has a deep, calming voice that I could listen to all day.
2486;He and James Earl Jones are in a tight race for best voice ever (although Kiefer Sutherland is catching up).
2487;The supporting characters are also expertly cast and well performed, as the viewer feels the perfect amount of affection or hatred for each of them.
2488;"It has some fantastic quotes (""I had to go to prison to be a crook"") some menacing villains (the warden) and some chilling scenes that are unforgettable."
2489;In the end, this is a movie about friendship and loyalty that I think all people should see and are sure to appreciate.
2490;"Go out and watch it now if you haven't done so already, because ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""
2491;It seems supremely ironic that two of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work have taken place in prisons: THE GREEN MILE and this mesmerizing drama, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.
2492;With director/screenwriter Frank Darabont's careful execution, this movie offers us Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in some of their most outstanding film work.
2493;As the movie unfolds, we are treated to some fine characterizations and superb, understated performances.
2494;"In addition to the brilliant work from Robbins and Freeman, savor the other performers: Bob Gunton as Warden Norton, a Bible spouting hypocrite who uses Robbins to become a wealthy man
I:8414;2495;With a marvelous score by Thomas Newman and the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a powerful examination of the power of hope, and a dazzling cinematic experience.
I:8414;2496;Turns out, the title is perfect.
I:8414;2497;This film is powerfully moving and completely captivating.
I:8414;2498;The acting is superb, some of the best I've ever seen.
I:8414;2499;This is an absolute must.
I:8414;2500;This is a classic movie that should be seen by everybody.
I:8414;2501;Based on the story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful movie filled with talented actors, a brilliant story, and more.
I:8414;2502;Still, Andy knows in his heart that he will be free someday.
I:8414;2503;this is a terrific film which gives the true meaning of friendship, and what one must go through in order to find the final redemption.
I:8414;2504;This film is brillantly directed, and the screenplay is outstanding.
I:8414;2505;Filled with heart and surprises, The Shawshank Redemption is an outstanding picture.
I:8414;2506;This is officially the greatest movie ever.
I:8414;2507;i loved it, and it was entertaining from beginning to end.
I:8414;2508;it is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8414;2509;two of my friends agree with me and say its their favorite movie ever, and my other three friends say it was great.
I:8414;2510;the movie is simply about all of the things that happen at the prison including new inmates, and working in the fields.
I:8414;2511;the movie is rated R for language and prison violence.
I:8414;2512;Go see it right now!!!!!!!!!!
I:8414;2513;Tim Robbins animates Andy Dufrense almost exactly as I recall him from King's story, and Morgan Freeman is as powerful as ever as Red.
I:8414;2514;The acting and directing surpassed the writing.
I:8414;2515;I have read the Last Lion twice with a spread of 30 years.
I:8414;2516;With age you get a fuller understanding of how entitlement played such a strong positive and negative place in Churchill's life.
I:8414;2517;This well written and well filmed movie depicts exactly the way that real prison life is.
I:8414;2518;OZ is pure fiction, but the Shawshank Redemption shows you the exact way that real prison life is.
I:8414;2519;Beautifully acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this movie lends itself to the pantheon of films that will still be on television for my kids' kids to enjoy.
I:8414;2520;The final five minutes of this film is one of the most indelible marks of greatness in cinematic history.
I:8414;2521;All in all, a flawless movie that every single person alive should see at least once before they die.
I:8414;2522;Morgan Freeman won the Oscar for his portrayal of Red and Tim Robbins should have for his part as Andy.
I:8414;2523;good movie with R. language that takes place in a prison?
I:8414;2524;crafted movie that ultimately lifts you up.
I:8414;2525;Seeing the prison in real life made me want to own the blueray .
I:8414;2526;and, actually watch it from start to finish.
I:8414;2527;I do think that this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time.
I:8414;2528;The underlying messege of hope and redemption is brilliant.
I:8414;2529;The story of Andy Dufrasne and his time at Shawshank Prison is truely marvelous and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a superb job.
I:8414;2530;Andy learns to adapt, in fits and starts, to prison life and is willing to take the long view of things.
I:8414;2531;Unexpected strengths are revealed slowly.
I:8414;2532;There are excellent characters sprinkled throughout.
I:8414;2533;This is a fine movie, one that has grown on me after several viewings.
I:8414;2534;I think it's one of Tim Robbins best performances
I:8414;2535;Would be a tough spot to be in under any circumstances let alone.
I:8414;2536;This movie is so gripping, so aweome, and it's great.
I:8414;2537;A monumental achievement for Frank Darabont.
I:8414;2538;He gets two life sentences for the crime.
I:8414;2539;He meets up with Red(Morgan Freeman) in prison and the two form a friendship that teaches Red about life and hope.
I:8414;2540;Red delivers with a poster of her.
I:8414;2541;Both actors here deliver their best performances and the director/writer Frank Darabont does an excellent job of adapting the story to screen.
I:8414;2542;(He's a big Steven King fan by the way).
I:8414;2543;This is a must have for anybody.
I:8414;2544;It's main themes are faith, hope, and the human spirit.
I:8414;2545;It's just awesome!Watch it twice, three times, it gets better each time you watch it.
I:8414;2546;The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the 5 best movies I have ever seen, and I consider myself a movie junkie.
I:8414;2547;The relationship between Robbins and Freeman seems absolutely real.
I:8414;2548;There are a couple of memorable lines that will stay with you for a lifetime.
I:8414;2549;That was such a good movie!
I:8414;2550;I'll just stop at saying that every actor I was familiar with gave the best performance that I have seen in their career.
I:8414;2551;the bottom line is that The Shawshank Redemption is simply a really good movie, nothing more and nothing less.
I:8414;2552;This is one of my favorite prison movies!
I:8414;2553;disc Special Edition)In great condition, love the features.
I:8414;2554;As video maker (microdac videos) and a person who love great movies, I can say without equivocation that this movie is one of the best that was ever made.
I:8414;2555;I would recommend this movie to any adult with intelligence to appreciate the story and the art form.
I:8414;2556;It's great to have in your collection and let it entertain you once in a while.
I:8414;2557;I'm pleased and would get it again.
I:8414;2558;I won't spoil the movie, but I will say that Shawshank has the best ending of any movie I've ever seen.
I:8414;2559;I also give the movie kudos for its discretion.
I:8414;2560;Finally, I agree that the acting is terrific and the movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish.
I:8414;2561;Definitely one of the all time greats.
I:8414;2562;Many friends told me it was a must watch video and it was as good as recommended!!!
I:8414;2563;If you love a good movie of good .
I:8414;2564;vs. evel and you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend it!
I:8414;2565;I had to watch this for a school project and forgot how good this movie is.
I:8414;2566;It is truly good storytelling based on a book by Stephen King.
I:8414;2567;If you are the type of person who really loves a good story, and does not mind a bit of darkness and a healthy portion of adversity, give this movie a chance.
I:8414;2568;The Movie:Every so often in everyone's life, they walk out of a movie that they consider perfect.
I:8414;2569;I have a couple of movies like that, and The Shawshank Redemption is one of them.
I:8414;2570;I still remember clearly walking out of the theater in 1994 and thinking that I've just seen one of the best movies that I'll ever have the pleasure of sitting through.
I:8414;2571;A movie so elegant and emotional that is perfect in its way of storytelling.
I:8414;2572;the movie stars Tim Robbins in one of his very best performances as Andrew Dufresne, a quiet man who is convicted of the murder of his wife and is sent to Shawshank prison.
I:8414;2573;It's there he meets Red , a convict played by Morgan Freeman who gets things from the outside for a price.
I:8414;2574;He first sees Andy as he's lead into the prison and predicts that he won't last long inside the prison walls.
I:8414;2575;Over time though, he's suprised that the young man is able to survive and soon, the two become friends with respect for each other.
I:8414;2576;One of the best cinematographers in the business (Roger Deakins.
I:8414;2577;Fargo ) did the filming on this picture and the pale colors are represented well throughout the picture, mainly browns and greys.
I:8414;2578;Images are clear and crisp throughout"
2579;Other than that, this is an excellent looking image that will certainly beautiful sound mix.
2580;The score by Thomas Newman is absolutely wonderful and it sounds clear and crisp throughout the picture.
2581;Surrounds are put into use occasionally, but always in a subtle way that is right for the picture.
2582;I'm happy the film is finally being realized by more and more people as a classic piece of filmmaking, which I've always considered it to be.
2583;One of my favorite movies of all time.
2584;I rarely watch any movie more than once.
2585;One of my favorites and this one was a gift so a family member can enjoy the great story also
2586;The Shawshank Redemption is a great film.
2587;unlike the usual buddy,buddy films that have The White Guy Black Guy as total opposites and then makes them friends at the end this film touches the core early.
2588;and reflects both Tim Robbins Morgan Freemans roles very well.
2589;the pacing of this film was done really well.
2590;this film was well directed written.
2591;it shows Life in Prison and the daily grind.
2592;It's a classic story of endurance, hope, truth and human spirit.
2593;I think it's a wonderful way to teach about morality.
2594;This is a wonderful story about friendship and personal growth.
2595;I would recommend this to anyone who likes movies.
2596;It is just so good!!
2597;Quite Possibly one of the finest films of the '90's.
2598;All around solid acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the lead to all of the other supporting characters, Heck, even the young kid from Ally Macbeal did a good job.
2599;Andy and Red soon become the best of friends.
2600;Andy's demeanour and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look within himself, and the world around him, while Andy proves to all the inmates at Shawshank that hope and determination can get you through even the cruelest of circumstances.
2601;everything about this film, from the directing to the musical score, is absolutely flawless.
2602;Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is absolutely incredible.
2603;The adaption is so good, that the film manages to be even better, because the story is too rich to be limited to a 100 page short story, and the film puts it on much grander scale.
2604;Darabont really shows how much emotion a musical score can get from the audience.
2605;It is one of the best I have ever heard, and it really drives the film.
2606;The story itself deals with the concepts of hope and freedom.
2607;They are the concepts of humanity which everyone wants, and it gives the film a more personal feel.
2608;the actors are do a phenomenal job.
2609;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give the performances of their careers.
2610;The warden played by Bob Gunton is outstanding because of how well he plays both sides of his character.
2611;James Whitmore does a great job with Brooks Hatlen.
2612;a great script with an identical adaptation, outstanding direction, amazing performances, thought provoking concepts of the human condition, and a briliant musical score.
2613;In 148 minutes running, the film manages to become a masterpiece that is one of a kind.
2614;This was a great movie.
2615;except this is one of my favorite movies, hands down.
2616;the acting is superb and the story itself, is just amazing.
2617;freeman and robbins were great together.
2618;I read this as a short story years ago and was so excited when it came out in movie form.
2619;The cast is perfect for this film and the story is just so compelling.
2620;I have watched this movie before, it always keeps my interest.
2621;I watched it with my son (29 yrs) and daughter (20) they both loved this movie to!Not for young children but a real great story for teenagers and older!
2622;I was very emotional after watching this movie.
2623;It's one of thousands movies that you can get lots of inspiration and motivation.
2624;This movie should be watched by many and I recommend it!
2625;Morgan Freeman does a great job in this playing his role.
2626;It's easily the best movie of the '90s, and qualifies as one of the best ever.
2627;Redemption is a stark look at prison life.
2628;From the brutal discipline of the guards, and the crushing lonliness that each and every prisoner feels.
2629;Morgan Freeman brings a vulnerability and a maturity to his character that gives it depth and dimension that makes it seem that Red's soul is borne before you eyes, and you know him as if he were yourself.
2630;I give this movie my highest recommendation, though it definitly deserves even more.
2631;This is a brilliant character study, a mystery, a drama, a buddy flick and a few other things all wrapped into one movie with an ending that will leave moisture in the eyes.
2632;i truly appreciated Morgan Freemans masterful narrative.
2633;"I liked the way the victim while having some of the most cruel and spirit crushing things visited upon him, did not become a mean, nasty person
I:8414;2634;This victim knew the good in himself, and saw the good in others regardless of the bad things they were guilty of committing.
I:8414;2635;This movie is amazing and the story of two men who meet up in an unlikely place in an unlikely way makes me feel hopeful that such moments will happen for me.
I:8414;2636;Andy and Red are the most mesmerizing pair of friends that anybody would want to see.
I:8414;2637;Andy has the faith and hope of young children with dreams of becoming presidents and kings/queens.
I:8414;2638;Red has wisdom and just enough hope in his friend Andy to barrel through any obstacles.
I:8414;2639;the loss of innocence and freedom are common themes found throughout movies, literature, and life.
I:8414;2640;Shawshank brings these major themes into focus allowing the audience to hope and dream with the characters.
I:8414;2641;Even the supporting characters carry a magical life of their own.
I:8414;2642;This has to be one of the best book.
I:8414;2643;if you like good movies you'll love this movie.
I:8414;2644;It even has Rita Hayworth for you classic fans.
I:8414;2645;Good Experience the date of receipt of the item.
I:8414;2646;Agree, this movie is one of the best movies, if not the best.
I:8414;2647;I'm a female, and I know women will love this movie as much as men do.
I:8414;2648;I really digested it, and the Shawshank Redemption became a part of me.
I:8414;2649;It's just a wonderful movie!
I:8414;2650;Edited on 8/18/2008It's not often you say that the movie is better than the book, but Frank Darabont took a good novella by Stephen King and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece.
I:8414;2651;Everything in this film works.
I:8414;2652;This is in my top 3 favorite films ever and it has been that way since the first time I saw it over a decade ago.
I:8414;2653;I guarantee you will watch it more than once or twice.
I:8414;2654;there's so much wonderful feelings in this movie.
I:8414;2655;Lots of reasons to own this one.
I:8414;2656;He now knows why it gets mentioned so much.
I:8414;2657;Great story line played out by great actors.
I:8414;2658;It will make you laugh and cry.
I:8414;2659;Great to keep and great to give as a gift.
I:8414;2660;everything is flawlessly connected and interweaved into what can only be described as a masterpiece.
I:8414;2661;tim Robbins is stunning as the heart.
I:8414;2662;breakingly mild mannered man who is sent to prison, charged with murdering his wife and her lover.
I:8414;2663;I could spend 10 reviews worth raving about Tim Robbins's performance in this film, and it is well deserved.
I:8414;2664;The perfect look, charisma and acting skill put into this by Robbins makes this entire movie worth while, in itself.
I:8414;2665;this is perhaps one of the most chilling movies I have ever come across.
I:8414;2666;visually and emotionally stunning, this movie is right on target.
I:8414;2667;If you have never seen it I highly recommend it,
I:8414;2668;The story is so good and the ending is so satisfying.
I:8414;2669;a movie that deserves a place very high in the all time best movies!
I:8414;2670;a great cast,Tim Robbins in his best movie and one of the most unforgettable roles in Morgan Freeman career, makes Shawshank Redemption an instant classic!
I:8414;2671;I don't normally enjoy screen adaptions of Stephen King movies.
I:8414;2672;But this one is well worth the nearly 3 hours it takes to watch it.
I:8414;2673;Kudos to Tim Robbins for a great acting job.
I:8414;2674;This movie is bound to go down as a classic!
I:8414;2675;It's a movie you'll watch over and over.
I:8414;2676;It's so beautifully written that it does seem like a true story, and i wish it was, but it's not i think.
I:8414;2677;The acting is outstanding, especially tim robbins and morgan freeman.
I:8414;2678;So once again, this is the best prison movie ever made.
I:8414;2679;This is probably one of the BEST movies ever made.
I:8414;2680;The movie is well written, the characters are GREAT and Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are Excellent together.
I:8414;2681;The colors are nice a crisp, very detailed and the sound is awesome.
I:8414;2682;If you have a Blu Ray player and a nice surround system set up, this is one that you will pull out when company comes over to show off the GREATNESS of BLU RAY!
I:8414;2683;This is a great human drama.
I:8414;2684;This continues until one day Andy does a favor for a guard and gets his crew a treat.
I:8414;2685;The warden is impressed by Andy's ingenuity and asks him to help him launder his kickbacks.
I:8414;2686;this is a great film about man's humanity under oppression.
I:8414;2687;Frank Darabont has crafted a masterpiece.
I:8414;2688;Morgan Freeman received his third Oscar nomination for this film and should have won.
I:8414;2689;James Whitmore once again shows what a great supporting performance is.
I:8414;2690;Frank Darabont's classic prison yarn based on a Stephen King novella (that is well worth reading) has only gained its fame retrospectively.
I:8414;2691;Failing at the box office it has since become a classic among modern movies.
I:8414;2692;Whilst there he makes friends with Red (Freeman), the 'man who can get things'.
I:8414;2693;Rather Darabont takes his time to introduce us to his characters and build up a realistic and touching friendship between the two Shawshank lifers.
I:8414;2694;This is a movie that tackles with such tricky themes as hope, friendship and freedom of spirit and pulls them all off in spectacular style.
I:8414;2695;In fact, for a prison film this is surprisingly tender, proving once and for all that this is a genre that can have a wide appeal when done right.
I:8414;2696;'The Shawshank Redemption' also benefits from fleshing out the plot of the original novella (which is only just over 100 pages) by drawing out several characters into some genuinely moving storylines.
I:8414;2697;of course, what holds the movie together most of all are the performances by the two male leads, who both give the performances of their respective careers.
I:8414;2698;this established Darabont as one of the most exciting new directors around and remains one of the best movies of its genre ever made.
I:8414;2699;I will say that Morgan Freeman's voice over is the best voice over in history.
I:8414;2700;Right now , I'm in the process of hunting down people who haven't seen it, so I can show it to them and see it again through their eyes.
I:8414;2701;unquestionably the greatest film of nineties(much better than its oscar compition Forest Gump and even Pulp Fiction), it, along with Midnight Run,The Thin Red Line and Goodfellas , is my all.
I:8414;2702;It seems that most of us who have been lucky enough to watch this gem have been profoundly moved by this story.
I:8414;2703;Now I love prison flicks and my favourites are Brubaker, Birdman of Alcatrez and Stir Crazy, but after watching Shawshank Redemption I can say this is one of the best films ever made, and one of the very few movies that made me cry, and it takes a lot for me to shed a tear.
I:8414;2704;The ending was filled with a great deal of satisfaction and hope that you rarely get in any film today.
I:8414;2705;If you want to watch a film that has a story that covers human survival, struggle, bonding and hope and want to be uplifted than this is the one to watch.
I:8414;2706;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both perform in some of the greatest roles ever, and the duo create a chemistry that displays true friendship and trust.
I:8414;2707;Through their bond, issues other than those dealing directly with the penitentiary are addressed and made evident to the viewer an honest approach to life.
I:8414;2708;In my humble opinion, as a college student and having first seen it in high school, it has only gotten better with time and it has indeed helped to shape my perception of the world.
I:8414;2709;Aready loved this movie, so wanted it in Blue Ray!
I:8414;2710;I'm so glad we took a chance because this is one of the greatest movies ever made!
I:8414;2711;So much more than a prison film, this movie is an inspirational triumph of the human soul.
I:8414;2712;a movie that can be watched over and over again with a great cast and story.
I:8414;2713;It will keep you engrossed from beginning to end.
I:8414;2714;A story about friendship, endurance, compassion and most of all hope!
I:8414;2715;you know it's going to be good!
I:8414;2716;This guy could recite the phone book and make it interesting "
2717;I recently bought the Blu Ray edition and it is a huge improvement in picture and audio, but the extras are carried over from the 2 disc edition.
2718;It must be one of the best loved and indeed greatest films ever made.
2719;It really is that superb.
2720;this is the most beautiful and ultimately uplifting film you could ever hope to see, whilst recognising the traditional conventions of prison drama (such as brutality and rape), it is really a film that demonstrates that the human spirit can overcome brutality with faith, friendship (and a rock hammer).
2721;This is as close to the perfect film as you will ever get.
2722;It is perfectly cast from the leads Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, who give wonderfully understated performances to the supporting cast of Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Bob Gunton and Gil Bellows.
2723;The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless all.
2724;time classic that will cast its spell over many people for a long long time to come.
2725;which makes the film worth watching for this part alone.
2726;the Shawshank Redemption is successful (like so many other films and stories) because it focuses so well on the theme of friendship.
2727;I bet those who have seen it and love it as much as i do cannot name a better film, it is THAT good.
2728;this film is a truely classic film, and a case of a film being released in a lowish profile, in the shadow of Evita (can you believe it!)
2729;and gaining a snowboard effect in the fact that everyone recommended it to their friends and so on!
2730;Even today it is still on the best sellers lists and has been voted in the top three films of ALL time many times.
2731;For me i have yet to see a better film and i doubt i EVER will.
2732;tim Robbins is so good in the role of Andy, and as for Morgan Freeman, you could not have picked a better actor to play that role.
2733;those of us that LOVE this film dearly should also love The Green Mile .
2734;I am just giving you my opinion and I hope this will help you to check out the film.
2735;the movie never does explain how Red is able to come up with that stuff.
2736;The suspense and characters keep one involved and intrigued.
2737;A must watch :) not to be confused with schindlers list (something I do for some reason!)
2738;this movie is just so well done!
2739;I love it and it's humorous parts, and it has just a great story to it!
2740;billion times I've enjoyed this movie, I wasn't surprised by the outcome, because I'd read the book.
2741;better than ANY book I've read.
2742;"I gain new insight each time
I:8414;2743;is the greatest film ever made.
I:8414;2744;Until today I still think that The Shawshank Redemption is the most extraordinary, impressive and engrossing film I've ever seen.
I:8414;2745;Throughout the movie, a constant message of hope transcends as its short but intelligent plot unfolds.
I:8414;2746;This film is a rare accomplishment that will uplife and move you.
I:8414;2747;It's nice to see the good guy outsmart everyone for a change.
I:8414;2748;Wonderfully acted movie, so much more seen and understood with each viewing.
I:8414;2749;Enjoy this movie and watch it every couple of months with the family.
I:8414;2750;The ending is the best when he finds the hidden treasure under the tree.
I:8414;2751;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:8414;2752;So glad I bought it!!!!
I:8414;2753;I cant wait to watch it again as well as share it with my family and friends.
I:8414;2754;I have watched many great movies in my time(and a good deal more bad ones) but not even the greatest of them celebrates the human spirit in such a simple and powerful way as Shawshank Redemption does.
I:8414;2755;time great authors Stephen King.
I:8414;2756;fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free.
I:8414;2757;is so simply brilliant that it somehow put s it one up over every other movie out there.
I:8414;2758;They loved it and couldn't wait to read/watch more!
I:8414;2759;I thought this movie was great.
I:8414;2760;I think that this movie was and is the best movie I have Ever seen.
I:8414;2761;The characters are spot on and the storyline is superb .
I:8414;2762;Caught this movie on t. v. the other day and realized again how much I loved it.
I:8414;2763;There's friendship, a man wrongly accussed, deseption, greed, and in the end justice.
I:8414;2764;Now you aren't going to find car chases and action packed scenes what you will a very good movie.
I:8414;2765;My all time favorite movie watch it every weekend.
I:8414;2766;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman present a fabulous story.
I:8414;2767;Acting and directing both excellent.
I:8414;2768;a great addition to my library.
I:8414;2769;This is one of the best movies ever.
I:8414;2770;The story and cinematography were both still relevant.
I:8414;2771;Not a waste of time to watch this powerful movie.
I:8414;2772;i too was skeptical about paying money to see a film based on a Steven King story but this film is a testament to his talent for creating characters and situation that demand the empathy of the viewing/reading audience.
I:8414;2773;all I can say is that SHAWSHANK is simply one of the best American films ever made.
I:8414;2774;Simply one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8414;2775;Maybe Morgan F. should narrate every movie, look at the success of March of the Penguins.
I:8414;2776;Awesome film"
2777;An absolutely wonderful and inspiring movie!
2778;I can watch this once a week and it never gets old!
2779;But Andy keeps his hope alive by working out a long range plan.
2780;He invites his good friend 'Red' to come find him in Zihuatanejo if and when he gets out.
2781;Against all odds we find ourselves pulling for Andy and Right to win out.
2782;This is a classic for me.
2783;It's one I love to go back and see every now and then, which is why I bought it.
2784;Beautifully acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, it's a story with enormous depth.
2785;What I appreciate is the exploration of the inward struggle to rise above the definition imposed on us by society.
2786;It's about the ability to retain hope, and the way life puts it before us to choose hope .
2787;The Shawshank Redemption, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies ever made.
2788;Both dovetail perfectly in elaborating on the human spirit.
2789;The book packaging that came with it gives you a lot of wonderful details about the characters.
2790;Have seen this movie before and enough has been said about this great film.
2791;having it in steelbook is awesome.
2792;This is the best movie I have ever seen!
2793;Tim Robbins is a good actor but he did a stellar performance in this!Morgan Freeman did a great job in this too along with his other movie called Glory about the Civil War.
2794;I liked this better than the green mile actually But Tom Hanks is the man of that movie!
2795;This is truly one of the best movies of all time.
2796;Clearly, one of the best films ever made.
2797;With narration by one of my favourite actors, MORGAN FREEMAN, and a performance by him that should have won him an OSCAR .
2798;partnered with TIM ROBBINS'S magnificent portrayal of a man wrongly convicted .
2799;is what makes this work.
2800;Not to mention, incredible characters we meet along the way.
2801;Attention to detail with costumes, sets and props.
2802;Spectacular footage rounds it all off.
2803;The prison itself is a character and it actaully comes alive in the film.
2804;And as Andy walks through the entrance and stares up .
2805;it's what keeps us all alive.
2806;put it on the shelf and watch it again every 6 months.
2807;The Shawshank Redemption is simply a piece of good storytelling.
2808;Andy, a reserved but sympathetic ex.
2809;This movie is as flawless as it gets, IMHO.
2810;Even thought the billing and shipping address was mixed up my wife still received it promptly, and was able to forward it.
2811;Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2812;Great acting, great plot, great story.
2813;The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies where after you are finished watching it, you feel good about life, about the power of the human spirit.
2814;How he kept his hope and his will to live alive.
2815;If you haven't seen this movie you will come away moved, on how good men can still be good in an evil situation.
2816;This movie is a classic and belongs in any good collection.
2817;It is long, cinematic, soulful.
2818;He becomes great friends with Red (Morgan Freeman), and their friendship builds up in the movie till it reaches it's maximum peak.
2819;"This movie is a ""Total Triumph"", and probably the best movie of the century."
2820;I have been writing stories so I can make movies when I'm older and thought I could make some of the best movies ever.
2821;Great acting by the main actors, and in my opinion should have won 'Best Picture' and many other awards it was nominated for.
2822;I gotta say Stephen King is an excellent writer.
2823;If you haven't seen this movie, see it.
2824;If you have, see it again.
2825;It is one of those rare movies you will think about over and over again.
2826;The characters are vivid in a way that is unparalleled.
2827;Each and every actor has just internalized their roles from the sisters, to the warden to the prisoners.
2828;a tale of a wrongfully imprisoned man who transcends all odds to escape.
2829;It seems fantastic and unreal.
2830;But as we follow him day by day, it makes sense.
2831;He was liberated from day one.
2832;One of the greatest movies of all time.
2833;A movie that you can watch over and over, enjoying every viewing.
2834;"There are some that come close
I:8414;2835;But for my money, I have never seen a movie that transcends the greatness of this one.
I:8414;2836;if you want great performances, The Shawshank Redemption has them in spades: Tim Robbins, Moragan Freeman, and the always excellent Clancy Brown do some of their best work here.
I:8414;2837;The rest of the supporting cast does likewise (especially that Miracle.
I:8414;2838;if you want cinematography on a grand and sweeping scale, look no further.
I:8414;2839;Thomas Newman's score is the perfect complement to the action and the scenery.
I:8414;2840;the story of Andy Dufresne as it is told in this movie is the story of an inner journey to freedom.
I:8414;2841;It is one of a man blessed in a sense by the shattering of """"the everyday."""""""
2842;I hope that you will give this film a chance.
2843;this movie gets close to the highest recommendation I could ever give.
2844;It is the best movie I have seen so far.
2845;The Shawshank Redemption ranks among the top five movies I've ever seen.
2846;Who knew such a heartfelt and poignant story could come from Stephen King?
2847;I won't give anything more not only because everyone else probably has explained the story in full, but I will say this: This movie has such a great finale.
2848;It gives you so much hope for the future and that all that is good eventually works out for the best.
2849;At the same time, it is entertaining.
2850;This is a great movie.
2851;and I finally got round to seeing it last night.
2852;"it's definitely a engaging film
I:8414;2853;with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at the helm, it was always going to be a worthy sort of picture.
I:8414;2854;skulled Hollywood way, by painting the moral world in black and white.
I:8414;2855;comprises only genuinely nice, decent, hard working, obedient folk.
I:8414;2856;He accepts his lot without complaint (but when he finally does speak his mind, he gets released!)
I:8414;2857;the resolution of the film may be predictable, but the manner of its arrival is nicely engineered: well plotted, Stephen King.
I:8414;2858;great call"
2859;this is a great movie,about life in prison ,and adapting to it.
2860;The story is so moving and I don't mind watching this over and over again.
2861;Better in steelbook package too.
2862;And trust me, you will be redeemed.
2863;Probably the most engaging movie I've seem.
2864;The little book is beautiful, nice pictures, nice paper.
2865;A must have for anyone who loves this movie.
2866;At the risk of telling you what you already know, The Shawshank Redemption is the finest film of the last decade, and quite possibly one of the finest films ever made.
2867;Seeing as we are all in agreement, I'll be brief.
2868;Frank Darabont's debut is a masterclass of storytelling.
2869;Every word, gesture and glance is ultimately of the greatest importance to the unfolding story, leading to a totally unforeseen resolution which left the audience I saw it with gasping.
2870;The friendship portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is believable and deeply touching, yet somehow avoids the sentiment a lesser filmmaker would have been unable to resist.
2871;I love this movie and the book cover its so great!
2872;This was another of my gift and he is so please!He already had the regulat version, so this is for a special collection!
2873;The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of the most well thought out and intricate movies of its time.
2874;Andy with his sly smile and cleaver tactics weaves himself deep into the prisons web of secrets and lies, but the prison is not the only thing hiding secrets.
2875;This movie is so good it is hard to describe in words.
2876;It is truly amazing how you pull for each and every character despite their questionable pasts.
2877;From beginning to end this story brings you back in time right inside those cinderblock walls.
2878;As one viewer put it, this is the best movie to never have received an Oscar that was ever made.
2879;I don't pretend to be a professional reviwer, but my opinion is that this is probably one of the best movies ever made.
2880;the chemistry between Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is both unforgettable and unrepeatable in it's essence.
2881;There are few 'extra's in this film .
2882;The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time .
2883;Such a good movie!Freeman and Robbins give fantastic performances in this riveting movie.
2884;would recommend as a much watch movie.
2885;It is my favorite movie of all time, and I don't really see that changing in the future.
2886;It has what is probably the greatest movie ending ever, and if you haven't heard anything about it yet, you will be taken completwly by surprise.
2887;Like it says on the back of the cover, the main character, Andy, is full of surprises.
2888;And he saves his best for last.
2889;As the title said this is my favorite movie of all time.
2890;About as close to perfection as any movie I have ever viewed.
2891;The slow pace, as with Lonesome Dove, is vital to allow the friendship to grow and to give us a perspective on the time involved in this amazing story.
2892;MUCH more than what is in the movie and so wonderfully acted!
2893;Music, pace, acting, script, story and cinematography and so on .
2894;This movie goes deep and it's theme blossomed beautifully.
2895;We really have enjoyed this tape.
2896;it is a great show and a true story.
2897;The Shawshank Redemption is always tops on my list of favorite movies, I may enjoy a ton, but this one is just so well done.
2898;It must be watched by all at least once, I usually give it a view once or twice a year at least.
2899;One of the best movies .
2900;It ranks way up there with the very few that I have watched more than one and felt it necessary to add it to my home collection.
2901;Tim Robbins does an excellent job as the prisoner who plans his escapefrom prison.
2902;I'd seen it years ago when it came out in theaters, but today it is as fresh and gripping as ever.
2903;are all brilliant in their roles.
2904;long life in hell is one of the most satisfying experiences in film.
2905;A brilliant screenplay masterfully brought to the screen .
2906;Very professional, and included info for contacting them if I needed to.
2907;it was with a great pleasure than I saw this movie.
2908;The Shawshank Redemption is my personal favorite movie, and I think you'll find that it's also the personal favorite of many a film lover.
2909;And I believe the story of The Shawshank Redemption is a story that many individuals can, in fact, relate to.
2910;"But what we do face, though, are many of own ""prisons"" and our own hardships, and I truly believe that those who love this movie see the main character (Andy Dufresne) as a representation of themselves ."
2911;Many of America's greatest films did not get their proper acclaim at the time of their release, and only as time went by did the public elevate them to their legendary status.
2912;Such is the case with The Shawshank Redemption, and in the future, I expect you'll find that The Shawshank Redemption is widely accepted as one of the greatest films ever made.
2913;if you relate to the film's story and of Andy's experience in the movie, you'll almost certainly think the movie to be spectacular.
2914;Three or four stars for a strong plot .
2915;Shawshank is a very good movie.
2916;My sociology class watched it and everyone laughed, paid attention, and actually liked it.
2917;He's a critic and loved it as much as I did.
2918;Beautifully written, fabulous story, wonderful actors, great set and filming.
2919;It has become my second favorite movie of all time.
2920;I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a great story with deep characters.
2921;It is a sad but very good movie.
2922;This movie was one of the best we've seen in a long time.
2923;The story was great and the acting by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins was supberb.
2924;I would highly recommend it as a movie to keep for your video library.
2925;Morgan Freeman always takes a good part in any movie he stars in.
2926;I'm 18 years old, and beyond the usual sci.
2927;Not only is the acting, location, and plot nearly perfect, but the movie also tells an uplifting story about a man who thrived in the darkest depths of Shawshank Prison.
2928;This movie is one of the top five movies I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.
2929;I've loved this movie for years, and had to add it to my collection.
2930;Robbins and Freeman give excellent performances, and the secret is awesome.
2931;Yes there is honor inside of the walls of prison.
2932;Great actors and a superb story of prison, friendship and honor amongst inmates.
2933;i did love that the fact that Tim Robbins character escaped from the prison after so many years, you could feel the triumph surge around you when you realised he had managed it!This is one of those great movie moments.
2934;a gritty movie, superbly filmed, that sustains a high level of interest and anticipation throughout.
2935;if you love a good drama or prison movie you will love this.
2936;First off it's simply the greatest movie I have ever seen, literally.
2937;"The movie is slow but, dramatic
I:8414;2938;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freedman are two of the greatest actors this generation has ever seen.
I:8414;2939;drama at its best actors were very believable"
2940;Anyway, my fiance really wanted me to see this movie, and how could I pass up a Morgan Freeman movie with his sweet seductive narrative throughout the entire movie.
2941;Regardless, it was still a really great movie and both Tim Robbin and Freeman did an amazing job in it.
2942;You would think that a film about a prison break would be boring, straight foward and make a very drab film but this was made very well.
2943;Shawshank redemption is probably one of the more empathic films i have seen the acting is perfect throughout and there are quite a few twists that get you more and more intrigued as the film goes on.
2944;The film has a great ending aswell after Red had spent all those years in prison then says what he feels and gets accepted parole and is set free then meets up with Andy (maybe i should'nt have mentioned the ending) well it's obvious that they get free anyway.
2945;The first time I saw this movie was in religion class my freshmen year of high school.
2946;It's definitely in the conversation of best movies of all time.
2947;If you've never seen it, it's definitely worth a watch.
2948;A must have for people who appreciate good dialogue.
2949;"Rare indeed is the film that can actually make you take a look at your own life
I:8414;2950;I have never seen any story, in ANY medium, that comes close to exploring the depths of love, hope and friendship as this film does.
I:8414;2951;I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend .
I:8414;2952;Thanks for the great service!
I:8414;2953;How does a Stephen King novel come to be one of the best films of recent time , if not one of the best five of all time .
I:8414;2954;I have seen this film inumerable times and am still completely blown away by it each time I see it, I used to think it was the source novel that made it the film that it was though on numerous viewings I can now say that it is one of those rare occassions that the sum of the parts far excels the core components.
I:8414;2955;To me it is a sign that when Hollywood wants to it can make a near three hour movie that has substance , the greatest acting seen in a complete cast for some time and a great story that hooks you in and makes you feel for the characters in a way that harks back to the great times of Movie making and it shows up all the inadequacies that are evident in modern film making.
I:8414;2956;This movie was tremendously touching and as my nickname attests to, it leaves an impression ( Get busy livin' or get busy dying ).
I:8414;2957;Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins give the performance of their careers.
I:8414;2958;This movie had a great story line.
I:8414;2959;It keeps you entertained and the story thread is engaging.
I:8414;2960;I rank this movie one of the best I have ever seen without a doubt.
I:8414;2961;This movie, adapted from a novella by Stephen King, crosses and defies the conventions of prison genre tales.
I:8414;2962;but it's really a story about faith in friendship and the raw skills of survival in an alien place.
I:8414;2963;There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman in one of his very best roles), a lifer whose regular appeals for parole are just as regularly turned down.
I:8414;2964;well, I'll say no more, in case you haven't yet seen this superb film.
I:8414;2965;Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly one of the best .
I:8414;2966;and the closing 5.6 minutes are watchable over and over and over.
I:8414;2967;Everyone should see this movie!
I:8414;2968;One of Tim Robbin's and Morgan Freeman's best performances ever.
I:8414;2969;Simply one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:8414;2970;I never saw a film that touched me as much as this one.
I:8414;2971;Just looking at the above picture brought tears to my eyes.
I:8414;2972;but I also remember the happy ending.
I:8414;2973;This has to be one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8414;2974;My husband loves it too and we rarely see eye to eye when it comes to movies.
I:8414;2975;This film is truly spectacular.
I:8414;2976;The suspense of will he won't he continues until the end of the film.
I:8414;2977;Has to be one of the all time best prison movies ever.
I:8414;2978;Frank Darabont is an absolute genius and the film itself is a masterpiece.
I:8414;2979;Everything is in place, it's part of this great composition.
I:8414;2980;the story's not so genuine, but beside this it's an absolute classic for everyone, (Except for those who don't watch hard movies)
I:8414;2981;Keeps you interested from start to finish, great cast of characters.
I:8414;2982;This is the best movie eve!
I:8414;2983;A must watch movie for everyone!
I:8414;2984;This movie is one of the best movie.
I:8414;2985;this is the firts time I saw it.
I:8414;2986;I really like it is the best story.
I:8414;2987;The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated hit that will have you caring and feeling for these men behind bars.
I:8414;2988;A excellent film, masterfully told, but with some adult themes and language children won't enjoy.
I:8414;2989;There is something in it for everyone.
I:8414;2990;one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8414;2991;Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with the many other great actors deliever remarkable as remeberable performances in The Shawshank Redemption.
I:8414;2992;The ending is so amazing, and the last minutes of the movie so filled with """"screen."""
2993;"beauty"" that it fills me with some sort of longing every time the credits starts to roll with the brilliant score."
2994;The ultimate movie about friendship.
2995;remember when films could be both positive and seem to have a heart?
2996;One of my favorite movies of all time.
2997;"a**""), THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is sure to renew your faith in modern filmmaking."
2998;long friendship formed in prision between Andy (played so wonderfully by Tim Robbins that I had to go out and watch his other films.
2999;"note: this is his best) and ""Red"" (portrayed perfectly by Morgan Freeman, as usual)."
3000;The classic references only enhance the fulfilling story of friendship, faith, hope and perserverence.
3001;this is simply a perfect film and will leave you close to tears, if not actually shedding them.
3002;This movie will teach you something, and that's a big compliment.
3003;and still like to give 4 stars for the entertainment value of it.
3004;It is a good movie after all.
3005;Well written, well directed, perfect actors for the roles.
3006;If you have never seen it before, than go pop some popcorn, get some candy and make yourself a nice drink.
3007;This is an excellent movie!
3008;The acting is incredible and even though the story plot is very similar to other jail escape type films, this holds your interest to the very last scene.
3009;The escape is amazingly surprising .
3010;I would highly recommend this movie.
3011;This film was elected as the best ever in the history by a major Japanese entertainment journal.
3012;But the story is really so so.
3013;It is a good movie and it should not be rank No. 1 on IMDb.
3014;Great movie, love the plot and life lessons.
3015;could write such a beautiful story of friendship, determination, and drama.
3016;It it perhaps the only story that I know of by King that has a wonderful ending that will bring tears to a grown man's eyes.
3017;Their performances were incredible and very poignant.
3018;'Shawshank' is a wonderful story of how friendship prevails and stands the test of time, hardship and injustice, as others have mentioned.
3019;I enjoy movies that are well written and well acted with meaning and this one is the best.
3020;This movie is a must.
3021;the story, screenplay and the cast are simple yet very powerful.
3022;the dialog is a huge drawing factor.
3023;But that usually means I catch it during the movie at some point and rarely see it beginning to end.
3024;The Blu ray looks and sounds good, a good transfer to disc job.
3025;but some of them, at least, are still human beings, and remain so in spite of the circumstances.
3026;In some ways, it is a study of how easily and thoroughly power corrupts.
3027;it is also the story of how one man uses his brain to make a positive difference in his circumscribed world, and ultimately triumph over the hypocricy and corruption that keeps him in prison, even though proof of his innocence is discovered.
3028;all of the actors deliver excellent performances, anchored by Morgan Freeman, who's character is the narrator.
3029;Warner Bros.' Digibooks are always nice to look at: this has a nice matter finish, relatively slim profile and nice paper stock.
3030;as a movie, there are very few, if any, movies that can be enjoyed like shawshank redemption.
3031;It is an awsome and touchy drama, superbly directed and acted.
3032;Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman were great.
3033;Both Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman could have easily won the best actor award in this movie.
3034;This movie is a solid prove that in Hollywood awards depends on politics rather than acting or film.
3035;If you like or even LOVE this movie, this is one of the best version to get.
3036;ray and it contains color photos, actors' biographies, trivia, and other behind.
3037;scenes information a fan of the movie would enjoy, all in a book form incorporated into the packaging.
3038;The price was a great bargain and it was like brand new.
3039;It was definitely worth it.
3040;Great film, but best film of all time?
3041;I saw this one in the theaters years ago, and loved it.
3042;top 100, no doubt, top 10, no chance.
3043;The Shawshank Redemption is considered by many critics, as well as fans, to be among the top films ever made.
3044;I'm sure you can find many more.
3045;There are few films as sublime as Shawshank Redemption .
3046;This is a lazy man's prediction for Shawshank Redemption has a screenplay based on a Stephen King story that is flawless, acting that is awesome and directing that is thoughtful.
3047;It is one of those rare major motion pictures that could be called a poem.
3048;The best movie in every movie store.
3049;I compare all other movies to this one.
3050;I give Godfather I and II a score of 9/10.
3051;I just get goose bumps everytime i hear morgan freeman delivering those wonderful dialogues.
3052;The plot is simple but with surprising twists, the characterisation is sensitive and believable, and the acting is outstanding.
3053;This gives a realistic, honest picture without excessive display of violence.
3054;This movie definitely deserves all 5 of those stars.
3055;The movie details the friendships that developed in his time here and also some of the enemies that surfaced.
3056;Even if you don't enjoy this movie, I can assure one thing, this will be the best ending you have ever seen.
3057;The way the movie was set up to lead to this totally unpredictable ending was done masterfully.
3058;This is a serious movie that ends on a light note.
3059;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both excellent actors who really drive this prison story along nicely.
3060;This my 27 yr old son's favorite movie, and not far from mine.
3061;Great movie what else can i say!!!
3062;we have a lot of reviewers they talked about the story, so I give the review about the blu.
3063;in my opinion this is a good almost a perfect transfer of the movie.
3064;Sharpness and a clearity are very good,like a blu.
3065;This is one of favorite movies, and for good reason.
3066;It is one of those movies that you're not so sure about until you see the very end, then everything falls into place in your mind, and it is a great movie.
3067;Outstanding performances by Robbins and Freeman help mold the movie into what it is.
3068;It isn't a prison that has a story to tell, it's a story being told about a prison and what it holds and is capable of, yet, the story revolves around two men, best friends, Robbins and Freeman.
3069;i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to sit and watch the lengthy, well.
3070;told story of two men, the prison that holds them, and the spectacular ending.
3071;This is a spellbinding and timeless movie.
3072;Terrific story and great acting.
3073;This movie gets two thumbs up.
3074;So very true, no matter your situation.
3075;An outstanding movie has to begin with an outstanding story, and Stephen King definitely provided that.
3076;"There have been a few really great adaptations of King for the screen (""Misery"" and ""The Shining"", to name a couple)."
3077;"Still, the two best, both about prisons and both written and directed by Frank Darabont have to be ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption""."
3078;as well as a good smattering of justice.
3079;This is a wonderful film experience.
3080;ALL credit should go to Frank Darabont.
3081;This outstanding work is coterminous with films like `The Longest Yard' and `Cool Hand Luke' in that it touches upon our ambivalence about prison inmates.
3082;Quite possibly it is the underlying threat of being immured ourselves, as we realize that it is really a fine line that keeps us free.
3083;of course it takes more than a play on our hidden fears to produce a film this good.
3084;It takes a good script, solid acting and characters that we can give a damn about, all of which are gathered here brilliantly.
3085;Above all it takes a good story, and obviously Frank Darabont knew one when he adapted this Stephen King novella into a movie script (you never really can tell what you will end up with when you endeavor to bring one of King's books to the big screen).
3086;He also knows how to use a camera to draw us into the prison world and how to exploit the power of narration (assisted nicely by the warm voice and splendid diction of Freeman).
3087;A truly great movie must have a truly great ending and this film actually has two.
3088;They could have ended it right after revealing the circumstances surrounding the escape as Freeman explains that he just misses his friend and it would have been fitting, but they continued and finish with a fabulous moment on the beach as Freeman succinctly explains in a voice over, `I hope'.
3089;It was and remains a masterpiece.
3090;the triumph of the human spirit.
3091;One of the best movies i ever seen, i now know why everyone love this movie after watching it.
3092;This is a movie you must see in your lifetime.
3093;With all the great Special Editions and Criterion Collection films that have come out, films that are worthy of true in.
3094;just production stills and trailer.
3095;A strong and compelling movie, I found it entertaining and not at all boring.
3096;I have seen before and will watch many more tiimes.
3097;Certainly a movie that is timeless.
3098;The interplay between the two main actors is delightful.
3099;I would recommend this movie.
3100;This is a great film to have in my Blu.
3101;Although the guilt or innocence of the primary character is never explained in full, his persistence in dealing with the system is inspiring.
3102;Definitely one of my all time favorites.
3103;Like the characters in the movie, it seems that this is a film that can grow and change and evolve with the viewer.
3104;time favorites (still is), and I wanted to see how well it was brought to the screen.
3105;Despite changes in the story and in some of the characters, I found that Frank Darabont stayed true to the heart of the story, and magnified what made the story such a wonder to read.
3106;Simply put, 'The Shawshank Redemption' was the best adaptation of a Stephen King story I had ever seen committed to film, and it remains so today.
3107;and beyond that, on its own merits, it is a fine film .
3108;very nearly a perfect film.
3109;It stands the test of time, with themes that are universal, characters that come to life immediately, music that strikes a deep emotional chord, images that quicken the heart and move the soul, and words that are familiar, yet new.
3110;and something that we can all gain a measure of hope from as well.
3111;Andy's story is a part of the larger story at work here, a tale of routine and of struggle and of the possibilities and risks that come with a hope for something better.
3112;It's a specific story about specific people in a specific situation.
3113;but it is told in such a way that its themes can be applied to many people, and many situations.
3114;Such a good story, so well.
3115;made, and offering such a positive message of hope and (yes) redemption.
3116;SHAWSHANK is one of my favorite movies of all time.
3117;Even if it's on TV and it's in the middle, I'll watch it.
3118;This is a definite masterpiece of work.
3119;It was an excellent film made by careful precision and detail.
3120;The story is consistent and virtually flawless, leaving a question free enjoyment of this great film.
3121;the story is a real grabber.
3122;The film gets you that involved.
3123;Tim Robbins does an excellent job as Andy, and Morgan Freeman is perfect for the role of Red.
3124;the way the film progresses is also extremely involving.
3125;this film deserves five stars, and it also deserves your money.
3126;Some may be disturbed by a scene or two, but I found it to be very enjoyable.
3127;it is definitely in the top 3 movies I love of all time.
3128;it is the message of hope?
3129;This film should top all the lists for the best of 1994.
3130;"Great acting, great photography, great script, great direction: the script particularly is a work of art
I:8414;3131;i can't really say any more about the plot without spoiling it, so trust me, it's full of twists, and turns and surprises, and is ultimately, extraordinarily fulfilling.
I:8414;3132;Andy was a banker, and very smart.
I:8414;3133;He's also very patient, and his patience serves him well in his finest hour.
I:8414;3134;There's some wonderful foreshadowing that is so subtle, most viewers won't pick it up until it plays out.
I:8414;3135;morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are understated and perfect.
I:8414;3136;Their characters are so solid, it's easy to forget that these are actors we've seen many times before, in other roles.
I:8414;3137;The supporting cast is great as well.
I:8414;3138;the camera work is superb.
I:8414;3139;In the greatest movies, the camera is not just a machine for recording the action, but is an active participant in telling the story.
I:8414;3140;That is quite true here.
I:8414;3141;It's two and a half hours that will be some of the finest in your life.
I:8414;3142;ray)Like with most people I took forever to see this movie, but that was actually because I knew the ending.
I:8414;3143;In the end one day I decided I'd had enough and streamed the movie.
I:8414;3144;I got almost every emotion from this movie, albeit not at a huge scale as I could predict some scenes.
I:8414;3145;I was also very impressed at how the movie gave a realistic description of a world within a world and how prisioners start up their own culture.
I:8414;3146;Also the great concept of Institutionalized , before I watched this movie had someone mentioned this concept I would just brushed them off now, I knew what Red means.
I:8414;3147;very good movie 5/5 Critique, 4.8 personally.
I:8414;3148;It grim, the acting is wonderful, and has one of the best endings of any book/movie that I have read or watched.
I:8414;3149;The pacing is very well done, the music outstanding, and I always enjoy watching it.
I:8414;3150;The message is wonderful, no matter how dark or dreary, no matter how loathsome life can become, there is always hope.
I:8414;3151;There is always a way to get out and start again.
I:8414;3152;Over the 20 years, Andy eventually gains the respect of his fellow inmates and forms a strong friendship with a resourceful life.

3155;The fine cast also includes Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler and James Whitmore.
3156;The 1994 prison drama is presented in a fine 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format.
3157;The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is clear and well balanced.
3158;minute interview with the film's director and cast, trailers and a 24.
3159;"Overall, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" scores a winning ""A""."
3160;The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films that I have ever seen.
3161;It may well be the best period.
3162;For quite a while it has ranked at #1 on the internet movie database, and with good reason.
3163;Not often does a film seamlessly blend gripping dramatic storytelling, with moments of lighthearted humor, as well as moments of deep sadness like this one does.
3164;And the journey goes on from there.
3165;There are so many great things for me to address, but my favorite is the acting.
3166;The entire cast was perfect.
3167;Tim Robbins gave probably the best performance of his entire career.
3168;He also grew on me, and I felt like I was on the journey with him.
3169;Andy Dufresne was definitely the whole package, and so was Robbins.
3170;when an actor gives such a powerful performance, there usually are not any other actors that stand out in the film, but The Shawshank Redemption is exceptional in many ways, including this one.
3171;Beside Tim Robbins's, there are a few more perfect performances.
3172;I enjoyed watching Red grow throughout the story, right alongside Andy.
3173;bob Gunton was great as Warden Norton.
3174;"He definitely earns his place on my ""Favorite Movie Villains"" list."
3175;But like I said, The Shawshank Redemption is exceptional in many ways.
3176;Captain Hadley is right on par with Warden Norton, in my opinion.
3177;I always pay attention to the music in films.
3178;So with that said, I have to mention the wonderful score done by the legendary composer Thomas Newman.
3179;He has composed some beautiful scores for big films like WALL.
3180;But the music he did for The Shawshank Redemption ranks among his best, in my opinion.
3181;i don't know what else to say about this wonderful film, besides how beautiful it is.
3182;It's one of my favorite films because it never gets dull, and it never gets old.
3183;Director Frank Darabont has not done many films, but I doubt he will ever be able to top this one anyway.
3184;This is a gorgeous looking transfer.
3185;A beautiful transfer for a beautiful film.
3186;Try to name a movie that everyone likes.
3187;One that you can show to a friend and be confident they will like?
3188;It is clever, touching, moving, exciting, and wonderful.
3189;I remember seeing this movie for the first time back in '95.
3190;4 amazing hours later, I realized that not only was it the best movie I had ever seen, but it was the kind of movie that changes my whole outlook on the way movies should be.
3191;And after the remarkable and surprising ending (which is still exciting after every viewing), Red realizes Andy's great internal strength.
3192;"frank Darabont does a terrific job with the directing and the script
I:8414;3193;The visuals and cinematography is also flawless.
I:8414;3194;Robbins and Freeman (who should've won the Oscar but lost to Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump)) are sensational in their roles, considering the fact that they couldn't rely on flashy sets of dramatic changes of scenery.
I:8414;3195;Wearing the same clothes and being in the same set scene after scene can truly demonstrate fine acting.
I:8414;3196;This movie truly shows the fine craft that is a timeless movie, one that remains in your mind since the first time you finished watching the ending credits.
I:8414;3197;One of the best movies ever made!
I:8414;3198;There are a few quizzical changes to the original text, but what made it to the screen did so in the best of ways.
I:8414;3199;Morgan Freeman plays Ellis """"Red"""" Redding, Dufresne's first friend in the prison, and the man who slowly draws Dufresne into a circle of the gentler, more intelligent prisoners, even as he's menaced by the, shall we say, less cultured of the bunch."""
3200;But Dufresne, whose philosophy is that freedom is all in your head, never does stop maintaining his innocence.
3201;"It's one of the ways King uses to show the passage of time in the story, and it's an effective little tool
I:8414;3202;It's another aspect of Andy's """"freedom is all in your mind"""" refrain, and it plays very well."""
3203;That's the only reason I can see for changing such an effective detail.
3204;"I'm certainly not saying it is in any way a bad movie
I:8414;3205;Its the kind of film you can watch several times and it still retains a feeling of freshness and eventhough you know the secrets, watching the film never becomes tiresome.
I:8414;3206;Director Frank Darabont finds the perfect tones in cinematography, writing and casting to breath life into this story with great flare and intelligence.
I:8414;3207;Like all great movies it never feels too long, every scene feels like it was shot, written and performed with great care.
I:8414;3208;The framing of the story is brilliant, the photography is cold and rich, really taking us into the Shawshank prison and it's interiors.
I:8414;3209;The performances are superb with Morgan Freeman really standing out as Red, our narrator, but Tim Robbins also delivers an immortal performance as the quiet, intelligent Andy who comes to personify freedom and defiance in a way only a great character could.
I:8414;3210;Darabont's script has a wonderful style to its writing, it feels like literature with a modern twitch.
I:8414;3211;discovered later), """"The Shawshank Redemption"""" returns in this impressive 2 disc set which gives us the film in a beautiful print and documentaries featuring fascinating stories from the making of the picture and interesting examinations at the movie's popularity and appeal to audiences."""
3212;Few movies really reach out and actually move us, few directors like Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, Fellini, Luis Bunuel and Frank Capra have actually given us movies that stay with us, embedded in our memories.
3213;I saw it for the first time in my life, and I'm 31 years old.
3214;I have been a big fan of this great classic!
3215;The fact that this classic has been released and remastered on Blu.
3216;This is an absolutely first.
3217;rate story about the survival of the human spirit.
3218;I watch this once a year, and every time, it makes me weep with empathy.
3219;"There are wonderful characters, funny, pathetic, and strong, as they survive in a brutal prison, run by a corrupt evangelical christian sociopath
I:8414;3220;the story is perfect, full of struggle and wonderful surprises, recounted by Red, the friend of Andy.
I:8414;3221;Andy is a remarkably resourceful man, who pursues several agendas at the same time, with patience and passion and pain.
I:8414;3222;Red, who becomes his intimate and special friend, helps him and then learns essential lessons from him about the value of life and freedom.
I:8414;3223;It is amazingly good and completely believable.
I:8414;3224;One of the truly perfect films.
I:8414;3225;A profoundly moving epic in the tradition of Frank Capra's masterwork """"It's A Wonderful Life""""."""
3226;"The story is tight and believable
I:8414;3227;The Shawshank Redemption is I believe still one of the most popular movies on the top 10 list.
I:8414;3228;Based on a Stephen King novella and directed by Frank Darabont, this film covers a 20.
I:8414;3229;There are many reasons why this film retains its appeal to me during the eight years since I first saw it.
I:8414;3230;Also, the unhurried pace of the film seems appropriate to the pace of life within a state prison.
I:8414;3231;Darabont's skillful control of the pace givens sudden, unexpected plot developments even greater dramatic force.
I:8414;3232;Finally, I admire Bob Gunton's portrayal of Warden Samuel Norton, a clever but corrupt and (when he deems it necessary) brutal public official.
I:8414;3233;The Shawshank Redemption now has and certainly deserves a high level of esteem which it did not (but should) have when first released in 1994.
I:8414;3234;The acting and directing in this film are outstanding.
I:8414;3235;I bought a movie poster of this film and have it framed and on my wall.
I:8414;3236;Watch this movie, you will be glad you did!
I:8414;3237;this is the best movie adaptation of any of Stephen King's books.
I:8414;3238;The story is awesome, timeless, and will definitely touch anyone's heart.
I:8414;3239;if you want a movie with a good story, get this one.
I:8414;3240;Don't expect lots of special effects and high tech wizardry, but do expect a wonderful story that you will remeber.
I:8414;3241;As most know, it is one of the true great movies of all time.
I:8414;3242;And now this movie is put on a blu ray package that is truly worthy of this movie.
I:8414;3243;excellent blu ray, looks and sounds fantastic.
I:8414;3244;And the extras and the packaging is just top notch.
I:8414;3245;A must for any movie buff.
I:8414;3246;This is one of the best movies of all time and it's on Blu Ray.
I:8414;3247;This is one of the best films EVER, if not THE best.
I:8414;3248;Truly an inspirational work of art.
I:8414;3249;The truth is, it is much more than just that.
I:8414;3250;It is about courage, determination, hope, and making the best of what one has, no matter how little that is.
I:8414;3251;It reminds us that good things happen to good people, to people who put their trust in the Lord.
I:8414;3252;Is there any penitentiary in the world with no violence, where all inmates are perfect, and can read and write English elegantly?
I:8414;3253;spoken, intelligent, kind at heart, and very touching.
I:8414;3254;In my opinion, all the acting was perfect to a tee, including Robbins'.
I:8414;3255;That is exactly the feeling Thomas Newman wished to portray, and it fits the film perfectly.
I:8414;3256;The music is subtle, quiet and solemn, but also contains magnificent, heroic sections which are quite beautiful contrasts.
I:8414;3257;That is when the sound is most gripping.
I:8414;3258;watch it, grasp its true meaning, and admire it, or just watch it mindlessly without understanding its significance to our lives.
I:8414;3259;A movie that will really hit home and can be appreciated by anybody .
I:8414;3260;anyone with a heart and a brain, that is.
I:8414;3261;Best movie favorite, had to own it.
I:8414;3262;Will be watching it for years to come.
I:8414;3263;Great acting, good hearted storytline.
I:8414;3264;Ok, so you already know how much I like this modern day classic.
I:8414;3265;The story actually has 2 endings.
I:8414;3266;If they don't know that it's Stephen King, they'll be surprised.
I:8414;3267;wHich brings me to a story I have to relate to you all:I had told a young woman from Australia about this movie.
I:8414;3268;She spots this movie and decides to get it because of what I said about it.
I:8414;3269;I love Tim's way of seeming as though he was the teacher's pet most of time, when he never ever was!
I:8414;3270;And what a surprise they all got when he was gone.
I:8414;3271;Just goes to show you that a honest man sentenced for a crime that he didn't commit when put in a certain circumstance can become what he must to survive.
I:8414;3272;By the end, you'll have the biggest smile on your face, and want to hug the person next to you.
I:8414;3273;People who have seen it knows exactly what i'm talking about.
I:8414;3274;I strongly recommend it to everyone.
I:8414;3275;This is by far one of the best films of the decade.
I:8414;3276;Morgan Freeman delivers a superb narrative and the picture excels in many aspects of film making.
I:8414;3277;Steeped in symbolism, the film leaves us with plenty of memorable quotes.
I:8414;3278;We can get into discussions all day and night long on what's the best movie of all time really is.
I:8414;3279;I've always enjoyed Stephen King films for their psychological thrill, this on the other hand has to be the most unique and fanastic piece of storytelling and character development in his career.
I:8414;3280;Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins gives flawless peformances playing incarcerated inmates who develop a friendship behind bars.
I:8414;3281;For 2 hours and 22 minutes this movie will have you captivated by the richness and cleverness of the film.
I:8414;3282;I have 2 movies that I simply love 1)Prince of Tides 2) Shawshank Redemption.
I:8414;3283;Regarding SR the acting of both actors was excellent.
I:8414;3284;The movie had such moving scenes I found myself cheering them on and crying at certain scenes.
I:8414;3285;I will say that Morgan Freeman did an excellent job narrating the movie as well as playing the part of a convict that took responsibllity for his actions.
I:8414;3286;Tim Robbins was at his best in this movie.
I:8414;3287;Steven King's short story was terrific and yet Frank Duramont (director), Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, Mark Ralston put capture on film the telling of a tale you will want to hear again and again.
I:8414;3288;I agree with most of the other reviewers.
I:8414;3289;This is a great movie in all respects.
I:8414;3290;The director presents a subtle hint at this in the scene where the inmates are stocking the library.
I:8414;3291;It's just a great movie.
I:8414;3292;Had seen it before but enjoyed it again very much.
I:8414;3293;This is a great movie that kept me interested the whole time.
I:8414;3294;even if you don't like Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman, this is an excellent movie.
I:8414;3295;great movie wanted it for the collection !
I:8414;3296;The movie was a great one
I:8414;3297;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play a dynamic duo.
I:8414;3298;The friendship and love created by these characters will cause tears to come to your eyes.
I:8414;3299;Andy is a character who is loved by all.
I:8414;3300;A heart warming film, The Shawshank Redemption receives two thumbs up.
I:8414;3301;Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and he doesn't disappoint here.
I:8414;3302;The screenplay brings out the best of Tim Robbins and Mr. Freeman making this movie one of my best ever.
I:8414;3303;This movie is a gift to mankind I would say.
I:8414;3304;Freeman and Robbins have shared a plot that has honor for every character involved.
I:8414;3305;A great story of irony of human society and its laws, and the people who lost their wild.
I:8414;3306;~This movie spreads that magic of consistent effort of life to bounce.
I:8414;3307;If you are looking for a great movie with a story to match this is it.
I:8414;3308;In the wrong hands this could have been a depressing and meandering two and a half hours, but instead is a beautiful, evocative and uplifting tale of friendship and hope that demands to be seen.
I:8414;3309;Add to the equation flawless acting and the best twist in recent cinema and you've got quite possibly one of the greatest films of all time.
I:8414;3310;It really is that good!
I:8414;3311;One word can sum this movie up, Wow!
I:8414;3312;Lessons of friendship and injustice, of dignity and the power of the human will.
I:8414;3313;The novella from which this is based gives all the more credence to the idea that Stephen King will one day emerge from under his undue shroud of literary cynicism as one of the 20th century's greatest writers.
I:8414;3314;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give possibly the best performances of each of their distinguished careers.
I:8414;3315;conceived notions, and enjoying this timeless classic film.

I:8414;3324;It is, quite simply, the greatest movie of all time.
I:8414;3325;At the end of two and a half hours, you sit infront of the TV with the greatest feeling in the world.
I:8414;3326;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give the preformance of their lives, and the rest of the cast is amazing.
I:8414;3327;By far one of the best movies ever written, directed and acted!!
I:8414;3328;A timeless and courageous story of human frailties and hope in a hopeless situation!!!!
I:8414;3329;One of my favorite films ever made.
I:8414;3330;Great stories, great acting, and great settings.
I:8414;3331;I have been a tall, similar man to Tim Robbins in this film so maybe that's why I identify with it so well.
I:8414;3332;This is another one I can watch over and over.
I:8414;3333;I'm a fan of Stephen King's stories and this is one of my favorite movies.
I:8414;3334;Now you can watch this great movie in Italian!
I:8414;3335;I watch it every time it comes on tv.
I:8414;3336;Love the story, love the actors.
I:8414;3337;Another fine Steven King brought to the big screen.
I:8414;3338;This is one of the few movies that has ever moved or impacted me in a way I can't explain.
I:8414;3339;i'm usally a fan of movies with shootout fights, and excellent plots.
I:8414;3340;With excellent performences by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
I:8414;3341;this movie just really captured my spirit in a way, very few movies and video games have ever captured me.
I:8414;3342;Out of all the movies I've ever seen, to me, this is the greatest movie ever made.
I:8414;3343;This is an excellent, excellent movie.
I:8414;3344;I can go along with it, but I would rather see him come up with a bit more original and clever method.
I:8414;3345;The Shawshank Redemption is, simply, one of my all.
I:8414;3346;Each aspect of the film clicks brilliantly, and the result is a film that is both unforgettable and an instant classic.
I:8414;3347;Andy's manner is quiet, patient and seemingly emotionless.
I:8414;3348;He leads his life by his own way and knows how to live it.
I:8414;3349;This movie shows you hope and inspiration can lie even in the darkest of times.
I:8414;3350;Probably the finest performances ever from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and one that tops their entire careers combined.
I:8414;3351;well I can honestly say that I was not disappointed.
I:8414;3352;In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is by far one of the best stories ever.
I:8414;3353;i recommend shawshank redemption to evreyone.
I:8414;3354;it has all the elements of a good movie: Good acting.
I:8414;3355;This is such a great movie on so many levels.
I:8414;3356;From beginning to end you are entertained and engrossed in the story and the characters.
I:8414;3357;The movie lets you watch the ingenuity of someone that realizes they are stuck in their circumstances and their greatest ally is time.
I:8414;3358;the main character that Tim Robbins played, Andy Dufresne, basically moved a mountain with a spoon.
I:8414;3359;the message I took away from this movie is: You can accomplish anything you set out to do, given persistence and time.
I:8414;3360;The movie brilliantly brought it to life even better than my imagined it.
I:8414;3361;One of my favorite roles for Morgan Freeman.
I:8414;3362;Nice to see just a good ending to a hard road.
I:8414;3363;Made Morgan Freeman my son's favorite actor.
I:8414;3364;One of the best movies of all time.
I:8414;3365;This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life.
I:8414;3366;I think this will become a classic movie.
I:8414;3367;A great story with great acting.
I:8414;3368;this is really the perfect movie"
3369;"Movies are not to be rushed through
I:8414;3370;i have never liked prison movies, but this one (and the Green Mile) transcends the genre.
I:8414;3371;It is not really a movie about a prison, it is a movie about hope and the strength of the human spirit despite unbelievable obstacles.
I:8414;3372;Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne, is fantastic.
I:8414;3373;Morgan Freeman, who narrates in his beautiful, soothing voice, plays Red, Andy's best friend, and the relationship between the two is deeply moving.
I:8414;3374;andy bucks the system, often, but not just to show off or be a smart alec, to improve the lives of the prisoners who must survive under a primitve, sadistic regime, and to help them feel like men, and have a taste of freedom and dignity.
I:8414;3375;tommy arrives, some years later, a young, brash criminal in the making, with a great sense of humor and defensive about his lack of education"
3376;The warden and most of the guards have a vested interest in keeping Andy right where he is, after finding out he was able to save them a lot of money on their income tax returns due to his banker's background.
3377;Far too valuable a man to lose just because he was unjustly charged.
3378;the ending is one of, if not the, most satisfying it has ever been my pleasure to see, and wonderfully satisfying after all the horrors these men have been put through.
3379;Red eventually wins his freedom, and departs the only place he knew for a world that is strange, unwelcoming, and hostile.
3380;this money is his ticket back to Andy, and a reunion that satisfies the soul.
3381;i watch this every time it is on TV, and every time I do, I find it as wonderful as the first time.
3382;"and enjoy it just as much, if not more
I:8414;3383;take a page from Andy's book and thank God for what you have.
I:8414;3384;time top 3 favorite movies.
I:8414;3385;But you get lost in a great plot and script, and incredible acting.
I:8414;3386;This is an interesting part of the tale .
I:8414;3387;Pretty thrilling yet amazing what some will do to protect their own interests, even at the sacrifice of others' freedoms.
I:8414;3388;I love this movie and now I have it on Blue.
I:8414;3389;One of the best films to come out.
I:8414;3390;tim Robbins is brilliant as the character of Andy Dufrense who personifies hope, patience and persistence, during his long spent time in Shawshank Prison for a double murder, in which he was framed.
I:8414;3391;morgan Freeman is beyond brilliant as Ellis Red Redding who personifies friendship and a great heart, and has a really heart warming ending narration.
I:8414;3392;this film works as both a character study and a feel.
I:8414;3393;when Forrest Gump becomes less respected, this deserving contender will rise even higher!
I:8414;3394;escapism(now how is that possible, well it is!)
I:8414;3395;the ability to extract a strong emotional reaction in which many movies can't.
I:8414;3396;pure cinematic art and entertainment rolled into one brilliant film!
I:8414;3397;One of the best phrases in the movie.
I:8414;3398;Of course here it is edited.
I:8414;3399;If you are going to a 'R' rated movie set in a prison.
I:8414;3400;Excellent story line, exceptional acting and one of the best endings in history.
I:8414;3401;This movie is one of the best I have seen.
I:8414;3402;The actors are excellent and the story is unforgettable.
I:8414;3403;There are few movies (or works of art, for that matter) that have moved me as this movie did.
I:8414;3404;The journey to friendship that these men take is simply a joy to watch.
I:8414;3405;the two actors do a beautiful job portraying the characters.
I:8414;3406;Moreover, the narration that Freeman does sets an incredible job of setting tones and leading the viewer on an emotional roller.
I:8414;3407;In the end, the redemption that finally comes took me to a wonderful place, and while it is strange to say that a prison movie can leave you feeling like a million bucks, this one did.
I:8414;3408;All I know is that this is an incredible job of movie.
I:8414;3409;making: fine acting, directing that allows the movie to move at the right pace and that doesn't overwhelm any other aspect of the movie, and a story that makes the redemption very real.
I:8414;3410;Yet, the ending still offers hope.
I:8414;3411;Great performance by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.
I:8414;3412;Incredible story and screenplay by Stephen King (yes, """"that"""" Stephen King)."""
3413;Definitely one of the ten best movies of all time, IMHO.
3414;The most memorable script to me: Either you get busy living, or you get busy dying.
3415;This was a good movie.
3416;The movie shows just how you can be prisioned even if you are innocent.
3417;What a great price I received it for as well.
3418;The actors in this movie were great.
3419;It is really about hope and redemption.
3420;If you have never seen this movie, you are in for a real treat.
3421;keep up the good work, Amazon.
3422;I love digital movies especially when I can get them at a great price.
3423;I loved the film, it reminded me of the prisons we make for ourselves in our minds.
3424;Felt great for the first time in a long time.
3425;One of two king stories turned into movies that actually does a good job on the story line!
3426;One of my favorite movies.
3427;This is one of the truly great films of American cinema.
3428;Frank Darabont proves not only that the power of hope is the strongest of all, but also shows us the power of the moving image.
3429;Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and of all of his stories translated into a movie, SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION probably ranks among the best.
3430;The casting is top notch, the direction almost flawless, and the musical score superb, and despite the errors in continuity listed below, this film remains one of Hollywood's best of all time.
3431;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two my favorite actors and this film brings out their best.
3432;sHAWSHANK is a tale of the triumph of the human spirit in a situation when an innocent man's humanity is trampled down with no hope for redemption or escape.
3433;"But Andy also makes some good friends among the inmates, most important of which is Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding [Morgan Freeman], who is also serving a life sentence."
3434;while on a work detail, Andy manages to use his financial knowledge to help the prison guards with their taxes and money matters.
3435;andy is never able to prove his innocence but he does devise an ingenious plan of successful escape from Shawshank after which he is reunited with his fellow convict, Red.
3436;And if you have seen it once, see it again and remember how wonderful it is.
3437;this and other movie reviews can be found on my website at [.]
3438;This is, without a doubt, one of the BEST movies ever made.
3439;It's gripping and truly a tour.
3440;We watched Shawdhank Redemption for the first time and we both thought it was a great movie, well acted, well directed and an interesting story that kept you mesmerized throughout the full length of the movie.
3441;face like so many directors choose to do today.
3442;i recommend this to anyone who likes a good story.
3443;A great work depecting how hope/determination can be the main driving force in a man's life when he is surrounded with not.
3444;so good situations and trying to cope with fears of others as well as his.
3445;it is my number one favorite film.
3446;it was also very under appreciated and somewhat overlooked.
3447;but now,years later it has become a cult classic,thanks to many Cable TV viewings,and has gathered a nice fan base ever since.
3448;everything about this movie is great.
3449;the storyline,the acting,the musical score.
3450;morgan Freeman is no doubt one of the best actors of all time,and he does an outstanding job in this movie.
3451;tim Robbins is just as great as well.
3452;it's really cool to see him put on such a great performance,because unfortunatly,you hardly ever see him in any other movies.
3453;he is a very underrated actor.
3454;"i highly recommend ""The Shawshank Redemption""."
3455;"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison."
3456;What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement.
3457;It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing.
3458;I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.
3459;it is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible.
3460;The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect.
3461;You will take delight, I promise.
3462;She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955).
3463;It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs.
3464;frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story.
3465;the cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent.
3466;all in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul.
3467;It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.
3468;This is just one of those films in which everything comes together.
3469;great screenplay (based on a great novella), great performances by Tim Robbins (my hero) and Morgan Freeman (my ultra.
3470;Freeman's narration fills in some of the nice passages from the book.
3471;a nice touch which makes this movie all the better.
3472;Simply one of the best movies ever made.
3473;That's a recipe for success in and of itself.
3474;second, it's just a good story.
3475;long friendship all ending with a very satisfying close to what shapes up to be a wonderful story.
3476;We also realize that Andy's calm, patience, and fortitude, is more sutible to prison life than his new found friend Red thought.

3479;"film Silent HillSilent Hill""visionary"" and ranking it 5 stars."
3480;But what's really interesting is that the director of The Mist is the same guy that directed The Shawshank Redemption.
3481;so my expectations for The Mist are very high!
3482;one of the top 5 I've ever seen.
3483;It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact.
3484;And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella, so there's some pretty interesting stuff (you can count on King to wow you with precise tales that include plenty of thrills.
3485;importantly, Shawshank really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King's novella.
3486;The Shawshank Redemption was a moving, realistic portrayal of a day in the prison.
3487;"life of a wrongly convicted man
I:8414;3488;the Shawshank Redemption is truly worthy of it's 5 stars here at Amazon, and it should be added to your collection.
I:8414;3489;Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship.
I:8414;3490;A great movie to sit on a roof in the spring time with a cold beer.
I:8414;3491;Definately a movie worth biting into and prying your jaws open with a crow bar.
I:8414;3492;Tim Robbins' acting is amazing and the story gives you hope.
I:8414;3493;Others in the family had elected to watch it and I was doing other things while watching it.
I:8414;3494;the story was so believable I researched it later to find out it was pure fiction.
I:8414;3495;which is a tribute to both Stephen King's authorship of the short stories that formed the core and the movie team that brought it to life.
I:8414;3496;If you're going to stream movies, make sure you have the capacity to do so.
I:8414;3497;I always cry at the end, it gives me so much hope.
I:8414;3498;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make a great pair.
I:8414;3499;It's pretty rare for me to get emotional at the end of a movie but this one really did it for me.
I:8414;3500;First thing is the script is perfect, the characters are realistic and the acting is incredible.
I:8414;3501;This is easily one of the greatest films of the 90's.
I:8414;3502;It's my understanding that I can only write 1000 words for this review.
I:8414;3503;To put it mildly, this is an excellent film that everyone will enjoy and get something from.
I:8414;3504;It is acted excellently, the script and story are wonderful, and the cinematics are outstanding.
I:8414;3505;I've seen this motion picture several times, and the underlying meaning to this film still effects me profoundly.
I:8414;3506;Its message is a simple one"
3507;To summarize, I thoroughly enjoyed this motion picture, I'd recommend it to anyone, and it will remain one of my personal favorites for years to come.
3508;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
3509;Beautiful acting, direction, cinematography, and even gives a nod to Les Miserable near the end, and that deffinitly makes it a big winner in my book.
3510;Steven King did such a masterful job on not only directing, but touching on deep themes on race, purigatory, and what it truly means to be free (and this is just a scratch on the surface compared to everything Shawshank tries to say).
3511;A bit raw, and certainly not for family viewing, but a well developed, told and acted story.
3512;Morgan Freeman is in top form.
3513;It has that sense of magic.
3514;Shawshank Redemption is one of my all time favorites.
3515;It is even more enjoyable with Blu.
3516;This is one of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins' best performances.
3517;The Shawshank Redemption is commonly said to be one of the greatest movies ever made!
3518;office but in 1995 the VHS stormed the charts as one of the best selling VHS videos of all time.
3519;Soon Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who is a man who knows how to get things.
3520;Andy is a smart man, and when people figure out what it is he's doing with Rita Haywroth, it's far too late for them to do anything about it.You'll notice that The Shawshank Redemption has no choppy, cheesy special effects and you'll notice it doesn't have a lot of humor.
3521;But what you will notice is it has fine performances, a story and the most uplifting message a movie has ever given before.
3522;a good story makes a good movie.
3523;Sure it didn't have a lot of special effects, but it had a story to tell, and that story was an uplifting story showing you how far hope can get you.
3524;"With a tear jerking ending and stunning revolution, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" really is one of the greatest movies ever made."
3525;I have seen this movie very recently and found very good.
3526;It has no violence and tricky stunt sequences but a good story line with excellent narration supported by the peak performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins.
3527;This movie is worth watching.
3528;I saw this late last night and, as normally happens with a good book, am still savoring the sheer, sweeping beauty of this wonderful movie.
3529;some things that stay in the mind are the patience of All things come to those who write Andy in making his escape, the lovely voice of Morgan Freeman, and the amazing shot of the Pacific at the very end.
3530;this is one of my favorite movies.
3531;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make for a stunningly good team in The Shawshank Redemption.
3532;Because of Andy's will to survive the harsh conditions of the prison as well as the corruption of the warden and the guards he soon earns the respect and friendship of the other inmates as well.
3533;all in all, The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie with a fine supporting cast in Bob Gunton (the warden), James Whitmore (Brooks), Clancy Brown (the head guard), William Sadler, and Gil Bellows.
3534;"winning, three year long production of ""The Woman in the Room"" ."
3535;a movie Stephen King says is one of the ten best fiction.
3536;"Darabont was best known for directing modern remakes of ""B"" movies when he first optioned Shawshank (The Fly and The Blob and the USA television movie Buried Alive)."
3537;Dufresne's kindness and intelligence help him to make friends with both the prisonkeeps and the prisoners.
3538;"Morgan Freeman plays Ellis Boyd Redding, ""Red"" to his friends, a ""man who can get you things"" and Freeman's voice."
3539;"In one respect, Red is just as intelligent as Dufresne (albeit a kind of ""street smart"" intelligence) ."
3540;it is an emotional drama .
3541;one where friendship and kindness rises above cruelty and injustice.
3542;"Hence, it is kind of ""romantic"" in the classical sense
I:8414;3543;I believe Deakins won an Oscar for his work and though the venerable cinematographer's collaboration with the Coen brothers may give you a better understanding of his range .
I:8414;3544;it is clear in Shawshank that his range is damn well, wide open.
I:8414;3545;If ever you wanted to learn cinematography, Roger Deakins is the man to study.
I:8414;3546;His camera work gives life to scenes that are ostensibly void of life, and his masterful work with black and white, with light and color, is one of the major components that gives Shawshank its powerful psychological tension and brilliance.
I:8414;3547;I also enjoyed the performance of Brian Libby as the jocular """"Floyd""""."""
3548;"And several of the scenes with James Whitmore's ""Brooks Hatlen"" are heartrenderingly emotional."
3549;Noteable also is the Hank.
3550;These are the images that stay with me the most after viewing this film.
3551;They are colorful and alive, intended to show redemption realized.
3552;It offers us the possibility of redemption from injustice, futility, and despair.
3553;It offers us a story wherein kindness and belief triumph.
3554;And in that, it may well be one of the finest movies of the human spirit at its best.
3555;Shawshank Redemption is a classic tale that has been perfectly transformed from Stephen King's written word.
3556;After many years of hearing How great this movie is, I Finally saw it.
3557;Anyone with a religious view point Is of course a vicious hypocrite.
3558;The climactic development Is patently ludicrous morgan freeman is great.
3559;I feel no great interest in ever seen this movie again.
3560;It will make you think about your life, about human nature, and about what a marvelous animal is man.
3561;it's one of the best movies of all time, and I don't say that lightly.
3562;It is a classic movie, but not for the faint of heart.
3563;When i'm depressed it gives me great comfort.
3564;I cried uncontrollably, at the conclusion of this movie, in the theater, when I first viewed this movie 20 years ago.
3565;I still cry,laugh and my heart feels full of joy, hope and sorrow.
3566;Thank.you to all in the telling of this story, this classic.
3567;the transfer to blu ray is as clean as you can expect it to be.
3568;Contrast on the Blu Ray has definitely been boosted and improved from what I can see comparing it to the Standard Def release.
3569;Details in background scenes tend to be a bit soft but are razor sharp in many of the close ups.
3570;can't say I have watched them all yet but there are plenty of good extras here.
3571;I did watch the 1/2 'Hope Springs Eternal' extra and found it very interesting and moving as well.
3572;There is a great parody of Shawshank Redemption call 'Sharktank Redemption' that is a must to watch and is dedicated to production/film agent assistants.
3573;I look forward to seeing the others.
3574;The trailer is also in high def and there is a comic spoof on the film which I have yet to watch as well as a collection of stills, storyboards and more.
3575;If you do, get the Blu Ray anyway as it is well worth it and will remain an iconic film with legs for years to come.
3576;It is one of those special movies that if you catch it on TV you have to watch it to completion.
3577;It is one of the best movies of all time.
3578;He was the one who's soul was redemed.
3579;For that reason this is a great movie.
3580;this is a film about hope and friendship more than anything else.
3581;Andy befriends Red (Freeman), because he's a man who knows how to obtain items from the outside world.
3582;Their friendship and mutual respect is there from the start and develops throughout the film.
3583;andy is an educated man and he finally attracts the attention of the most brutal prison guard in a memorable rooftop scene.
3584;That single event is the catalyst for significant change in Andy's life.
3585;liked by both the inmates and the guards.
3586;He provides the main source of conflict in the film.
3587;He makes the best of his situation at all times.
3588;the final 30 minutes of the film is extremely uplifting.
3589;Stephen King wrote the short story on which the film is based and his influence can clearly be seen.
3590;One of the things I like about King is the sense of justice present in his stories.
3591;The Shawshank Redemption covers 20 years of Andy's life.
3592;Darabont wanted the final scene to be omitted, but the conclusion is still incredible.
3593;If you watch the film, you'll see why.
3594;one of the themes present in the film is how inmates can become institutionalized.
3595;i would recommend The Shawshank Redemption to anyone.
3596;You might not like it, but there's a strong chance you will.
3597;Robbins and Freeman are both superb.
3598;I watch the film twice a year and never tire of seeing it.
3599;There's already dozens of reviews praising this movie, so I'll just keep it simple.
3600;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman work together beautifully, and really help immerse you in the amazing story.
3601;"This subtitle is one of the most important themes in the book, and it carries well into the movie
I:8414;3602;Unlike Frank Darabont's more recent efforts, """"The Shawshank Redemption"""" is near perfect."""
3603;Not only the pinnacle of the prison film genre, it's one of the best films of all time.
3604;"Everything works here: the screenplay is stunning
I:8414;3605;A film spanning two decades of developing friendship needs to be long, but Darabont unwinds his tale with such consummate skill that your interest never wanes.
I:8414;3606;In fact, it keeps growing.
I:8414;3607;He makes us feel for Andy, Red and their fellow cons, so their quest for dignity and survival becomes our own.
I:8414;3608;The vignettes mix comedy and violence, striking just the right balance between hope and despair.
I:8414;3609;For raw emotional power, the climax and denouement are almost unrivalled"
3610;determination will stay with you forever.
3611;touch our souls and make us want to be better people.
3612;Hope is a wonderful thing.
3613;this film is a story which centres primarily around these two themes and is one of the most moving and uplifting films I have been fortunate enough to see.
3614;It's a wonderful movie with moving performances by terrific actors.
3615;There are lots of good extras on this Special Edition.
3616;This is my personal favorite Stephen King film adaptation.
3617;It is a story of the incredible patience of a secretive and intense individual in the face of incredible hardship.
3618;Morgan Freeman, always an asset to a film, is at his best in a supporting role that shines forth without robbing the plot.
3619;but it is a great movie to watch and great as background.
3620;Definitely one of the most great films I have ever seen.
3621;Direction is excellent, Robbins and Freeman are more than great.
3622;An amazing story about self.
3623;This movie was one of the best I've ever seen.
3624;very nice pace, keeps the viewer engrossed throughout.
3625;I liked the story of hope and fighting that lead two people to a great friendship and helped each other through out the movie with their bond in friendship
3626;This is my personal favorite.
3627;A story of courage and hope amidst hopelessness.
3628;It is a timeless classic.
3629;It is my husbands favorite.
3630;That's why I continue to shop at amazon.
3631;Great movie about people who have incredible fortitude, courage and grit.
3632;Morgan is excellent as Robbins friend and gets him stuff he wants.
3633;But the way Robbins escapes is nothing but amazing.
3634;I was not disappointed, this is a riveting story that holds your interest from beginning to end.
3635;I would recommend this to any age group.
3636;It is a great movie and should be an Oscar winner in any year except the one with Forest Gump.
3637;This is an awesome movie, a classic.
3638;Morgan Freeman is one of, if not my most favorite male actors.
3639;One of my favorite movies ever made.
3640;My wife and I have seen this movie 5 times on TV and are captivated each time we see it.
3641;still going strong after all these years.
3642;It's great and full of history.
3643;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic as Andy Dufrane and Red.
3644;The film goes on for a good two hours without seeming dull and there's great character devlopment.
3645;The prison break scene has always stayed in my mind and the score to the film is magnificent and I haven't heard a better one to this date.
3646;The last twenty minutes or so of Red's life outside the prison is wonderful.
3647;One on the themes and why so many people love this movie after it went to home video, and another on the acutal making of the film.
3648;"There's a director's commentary on the film in which Frank gives us very good insight to the film, and there's a parody movie ""The Shark Tank redemption"" starring Morgan Freeman's son (Who also made a cameo in Shawshank redemption) and the interview between Charlie Rose, Frank, Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins."
3649;One of my favorite movies of all time, found this deal on Amazon and decided to jump on it.
3650;the package was well put together and had a few extras I wasn't expecting.
3651;The details of this movie are astonishing, at times unpredictable and filled with surprises.
3652;I ordered this as a Christmas Gift and it arrived very fast.
3653;It's better than any movie I can remember seeing in the past five years.
3654;Every so often, I feel cinematic achievement reaches a new zenith.
3655;Yet, as said, I am eventually mistaken, mainly due to remarkable stories of profound creative intensity.
3656;the Shawshank Redemption is truly an element of such a category.
3657;Still, it is brilliantly adapted as a feature.
3658;Think about what it means, and how easy may be to take for granted in today's liberated world.
3659;Still, despite the misery of indeterminate and forceful detainment, a love of life is found.
3660;Rather, it continues by showing the affects of being reintroduced to reality, and the ensuing overdose of true liberty.
3661;cut as the overall theme may seem, a mark of cunning snakes through it.
3662;One of my favorite movies!Beautiful acting with a powerful message.
3663;great price and quick shipping .
3664;i give this a thumbs up!
3665;As with most really good movies the story is about various types of people, their motivations, and their relationships.
3666;Came highly recommended and it was simply OK for me.
3667;Probably was great when it came out but there's sooooo many modern day movies with great endings, I simply wasn't wowed!
3668;An old movie that i can always watch in the comfort of my own home.
3669;A Great movie, will enjoy this for many years.
3670;Shipped quickly by Amazon and in perfect condition.
3671;Great acting and great story line.
3672;Close to real as its going to get.
3673;Morgan Freeman is awesome in this movie.
3674;Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are one of the best duos to ever hit the big screen.
3675;They're chemistry together is uncanny.
3676;The scripting is right on point.
3677;The movie is very inspirational and offers some form of hope to a brighter better future.
3678;this is a movie to grab along with popcorn and blanket
3679;The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that never ages.
3680;"Based on the Stephen King nouvella called ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"", the movie is one of the best in the prison film genre."
3681;We discover that Robbin's character Andy is innocent, and the just of the story is seeing if he does indeed survive his tenure at one of the most horrendous prisons in the country.
3682;american buddy, played superbly by Morgan Freeman.
3683;This is an excellent five star movie.
3684;A wonderful couple of hours entertainment for the price.
3685;The acting is good, the lines are good, the plot thickens.
3686;Can't come up with words for how I feel about this movie right now.
3687;Definitely a movie I'll remember.
3688;old movie and made it look brand new.
3689;It's actually good enough to use if you're showing off your new flat.
3690;ray and like this movie at all, this disc is a must.
3691;Everyonce in a while, a movie comes along that changes the way you look at filmaking.
3692;But one day, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who changes the way he looks at life.
3693;But, the main focus is hope, and thats what makes it so great.
3694;The film grows on you.
3695;Everytime you veiw it, something new is picked up which makes it that much more enjoyable.
3696;The music and direction of the film is remarkable.
3697;In every way, this movie is a classic.
3698;It has friendship, hardship, hope and a true message.
3699;But it's a more audacious film than that.
3700;The movie dares to tell us that the mind is a beautiful thing, the most beautiful thing.
3701;He survives by using his intellect.
3702;"Ask yourself this: when was the last time did a movie play classical music and did not either denegrate it, or show how pop music is really more ""fun"" and ""cool."
3703;Yet few reviews of the movie really delve into this fact: the Shawshank Redemption unapologetically glorifies the intellect.
3704;All the more ironic that it was triumphed that year at both the box office and the Academy by an ode to anti.
3705;funny how Hollywood's own never seem to live by that philosophy.
3706;The Shawshank Redemption has been redeemed on home video, where it has become one of the most popular titles of all time.
3707;I think its reputation is well deserved.
3708;A cinematic delight, masterful, compelling and a very fine work of art indeed.
3709;The combination of deep storyline, fantastic acting, and the exploration of meaning of life make this one of the best movies ever produced.
3710;Highly recommend to any movie fan!
3711;Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.
3712;The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.
3713;After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.
3714;His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.
3715;Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.
3716;"Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of King's equally noteworthy novella, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption""."
3717;In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.
3718;"While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does employing the cunning Thomas Newman (who would later dazzle us with his score for ""American Beauty"") showing recognition for the film's needs of an emotional score
I:8414;3719;With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong seed to work with.
I:8414;3720;The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.
I:8414;3721;While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.
I:8414;3722;Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.
I:8414;3723;with all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.
I:8414;3724;These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.
I:8414;3725;Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.
I:8414;3726;Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.
I:8414;3727;Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.
I:8414;3728;He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.
I:8414;3729;Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities.
I:8414;3730;These artists show their capability to produce art"
3731;The Shawshank Redemption delivers much.
3732;needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film, proving that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.
3733;though it comes from a very specific time in US history, the story feels timeless due to the insular world of Shawshank.
3734;This is easily one of the best prison/prison.
3735;escape movies of all time, but more, it's one the best MOVIES of all time, period.
3736;"But they are all worth enduring, and very important to the overall concept of this movie, which is that there is something in the human spirit which is incorruptible and enduring, the sense of ""hope,"" the feeling that no matter how bleak one's situation and surroundings may be, keeping hope alive is essential to getting through the incomprehensible and obscene circumstances which Tim's character has to endure before his final reward, freedom."
3737;The acting by all is superb.
3738;The musical score is contemplative and powerful at times, and every situation and character is believable and seems well thought out and played consistently throughout.
3739;Each scene has its own special grace and power, from the sublime and subtle.
3740;"ness"" which embraces the movie as a whole, start to finish."
3741;i can't recommend this movie enough to those who have not yet experienced its power, its grace, and its testament to hope, and faith, and belief that no matter what the odds, whatever the conditions we all may find ourselves in this game (sometimes very cruel and unforgiving) called life, keeping hope alive is or should be our first commandment.
3742;timer (and eventual suicide victim) James Whitmore as well, but every actor and every scene and every move in this excellent film is top.
3743;a great, great, great, great movie.
3744;I hope I can make it across the border.
3745;I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand.
3746;In my opinion, Freeman deserves an oscar for his role, it was fresh, original and beautifully done.
3747;It is sad and their loss, as this is one of the greatest movies made.
3748;It is a travesty towards the others and most of us are intelligent, despite what these people think of us.
3749;My honest advice to the rest is please see the movie for yourself and make up your mind.
3750;It is a favorite for me, and I can proudly say that I know more about movies than these reviewers.
3751;This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time.
3752;This is simply a must see film.
3753;Beautifully written, wonderfully acted, and a perfectly crafted film.
3754;perfect performances joined by an excellent supporting cast.
3755;This is one of the best movies ever made with superb acting.
3756;It is comparible to Scent of a Woman , Forrest Gump and Rudy in its portrayal of the triumph of the human spirit.
3757;I watch it at least once every couple of months to remind me of what is important in life.
3758;I recommend it without reservation.
3759;This movie was well done and the actors were remarkable.
3760;My girlfriend told me I'd love it and I do!
3761;I never wanted to pull out my phone or do anything but keep my eyes glued to the screen.
3762;: Not surprisingly, this is a very powerful drama which has been adapted from the pen of Maine author Stephen King.
3763;"I say not surprisingly, because this came from the same collected works which brought us the equally stunning ""Stand By Me""."
3764;King is not only a legendary horror novelist, he's also a staggeringly prolific writer of human drama, capturing each nuance perfectly and precisely and leaving room to bring those nuances easily to film.
3765;"Director Frank Darabont pieced all the right elements into place to bring a faithful rendition of King's work to the screen (he would later do the same thing for ""The Green Mile"")."
3766;He soon acquires a small group of friends on the inside, using them to support his idea of hope.
3767;The entire film has a tone of its own that closely captures the period between the 1940's and the 1960's.
3768;"Adding to that tone is the sumptuous musical score by the always reliable Thomas Newman (""American Beauty"", ""Meet Joe Black"") and the stark cinematography by frequent Coen Brothers' collaborator Roger Deakins."
3769;"Freeman turns in one of the best performances of his career (and that's certainly saying something) playing ""the only guilty man in Shawshank"", Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding."
3770;In some respects, that makes his character more enjoyable to watch as we uncover each separate layer of a very complex individual.
3771;"Clancy Brown gives a wonderfully understated performance as prison guard Byron Hadley, a refreshing change from the outrageously over the top performance he gave in the original ""Highlander"" film eight years prior."
3772;The sleeper performance of the film comes from aging screen veteran James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlin.
3773;Still, the best moments of this movie come in the scenes shared by Robbins and Freeman.
3774;These two consummate professionals play off each other so beautifully that it's easy to forget this is only a movie and not an actual historical snapshot of two convicted prisoners.
3775;A genuine feel good film that will stick with you long after you've watched it.
3776;The dialogue, however, is crisp and evenly separated while gunshots are upfront and brilliant to the ear.
3777;The package itself is a wonderful recreation of the original video release cover, although it has been issued in an atypical Warner Bros. paper case.
3778;Bonus features for this disc include an enjoyable cast and crew information section which gives brief histories for Robbins, Freeman and director Frank Darabont.
3779;There's also a minimally entertaining production stills gallery, which showcases thirty behind.
3780;scenes photographs, and notations for the awards this film won upon its initial release.
3781;It's a neatly arranged presentation which spotlights the film's best virtues and captures the potential viewer's interest.
3782;"It contains a commentary track with director Frank Darabont, two documentaries, interviews from ""The Charlie Rose Show"" and more."
3783;The film Shawshank Redemption deals with something more important than either of the other issues.
3784;What the U. S. prison system does to the human beings involved with it.
3785;Shawshank Redemption brilliantly shows you what prisons do to people.
3786;At his best, King writes stories like Shawshank and Green Mile, stories that create memorable characters whose humanity is more of the focus than the supernatural.
3787;Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins' acting is understated and subtle, and the supporting cast is impressive.
3788;Shawshank is one of those rare films where everything just clicks perfectly, and all of the seemingly disparate pieces fit perfectly together to leave the viewer feeling as redeemed as the main character.
3789;awesome movie to watch with friend and family.Yes I recommend it 100% strong messagelove, love, love moreenjoy
3790;I occasionally see this movie on TV (without the language) and enjoy it very much.
3791;I payed extra for the special edition copy of this movie, which came with the movie and a metal cover case.
3792;I thought that it was really well performed by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.
3793;They send him to prison for 40 years and then the movie starts getting really good.
3794;I have never seen such a good story written before but now after I saw this I can understand that there are some really amazing talent out there.
3795;I liked the ending of the movie because it is a really satisfying ending it makes you feel a lot for these two characters Andy and Red (freeman) and after seeing this movie I have come up with some great ideas for a book about prison life
3796;This movie was one of the best movies ever made.
3797;When I think of The Shawshank Redemption , I see it as the most perfectly made movie I have ever seen, flat out!
3798;True, it is only my personal third favorite film behind Heart and Souls and Forrest Gump , but I do see it as the best movie ever made for it's crafty storytelling.
3799;The progression of the characters and the messages throughout this film weave such a strong and profound story that it will leave you breathless.
3800;And Morgan Freeman's narration gives such REALISTIC heart that it has the power to touch ANYONE, not just people looking to be touched.
3801;Sharp, fresh, and thoroughly powerful!
3802;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman along with the supporting cast were very good and I think they gave a feeling that prison life is dreadful and maybe the young people who saw the movie are now more determined to live a lawful life.
3803;So many other reviewers have already done it pretty darn good.
3804;however, I can tell you that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this motion picture.
3805;An absolutely great picture that is a must see.
3806;This is a movie to own!
3807;Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.
3808;marked the starting line for this race, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION .
3809;starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in each actor's finest roles .
3810;Contrary to what you might think, this tale has much less to do with a wrongly imprisoned man who manages a stunning and bold escape than it does with one simple ideal: Hope.
3811;bettering the original text by miles, Frank Darabont's 1994 masterpiece captures and conveys the struggle, despair and .
3812;Yet all the while Dufresne holds onto the notion that hope will endure.
3813;You see, Andy is an innocent man.
3814;"Not even his newest ""friend"", Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Freeman)."
3815;The basic premise is still present.
3816;I could go into greater explanation about how this film has affected me in a very deep and graphic way.
3817;I hope to see my friend.
3818;I hope to shake his hand.
3819;bring a flood of tears and goose bumps forward in my psyche.
3820;this film is by far one of the greatest films to come out of the 1990's.
3821;King's tale of hope is felt so deeply throughout the film.
3822;The film provided a glimpse toward hope.
3823;And again, along came THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.
3824;it is for this reason that I believe that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of the greatest films of all time.
3825;Showing us the path in 1994, and providing us a gentle reminder in 2004.
3826;"Because, as Andy himself writes in his last letter to his dear friend Red: """"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things."
3827;I hope this letter finds you.
3828;It is a credo that I live by and live for.
3829;And in a very real sense, every time I watch this film, hope springs eternal.
3830;I am a firm, committed believer in the Whole Bible with this in mind.
3831;I think this is one of the great movies around and needs to be watched for a litany of reasons.
3832;creatively it is a winner.
3833;Acted, and directed to get the biggest punch for the scene.
3834;"the moral lessons are very strong
I:8414;3835;Maybe a 15 year old with life experience.
I:8414;3836;The rawness of the movie makes me cringe, but then that is also the acting done so well.
I:8414;3837;so if you want a well acted, directed and timely movie, then this is a winner.
I:8414;3838;i got mine in the mail a couple of hours ago and found that the case that held the blu.
I:8414;3839;:[ its still an amazing movie.
I:8414;3840;Don't get me wrong, the short story is great, but the ending to the film is much more satisfying than the ending to the book.
I:8414;3841;Often times these snotty, scumbag screen writers take it upon themselves to leave the most important story elements in, but to make the endings more """"user friendly,"""" for want of a better term."""
3842;There are more story elements, and the ending .
3843;I missed this movie in the theaters and I missed a great movie.
3844;Underneath that story is a story about perseverance, and hope.
3845;Mr Darabont is a talented and gifted director and I would like to know more about what he was thinking when he made the Shawshenk Redemption.
3846;The prison warden also takes advantage of Andy's banking knowledge by exchanging privileges for creative bookkeeping.
3847;The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that is a true work of both art and magic.
3848;This movie begins in a way that is amazing in many ways.
3849;In final note looking for a moment in a movie were all thing's are possible in the darkest of times, anythig is still possible.
3850;One of the greatest movies that didn't get enough buzz because of Forrest Gump.
3851;What a classic, wonderful movie.
3852;In fact the opposite is true, these black bars actually preserves the entire film.
3853;What you saw in the theater is actually what you see on the TV screen.
3854;This is actually your full screen version of a movie.
3855;Oh yeah.you're such an example to rate this great movie as unbelievable, your believing in vampires and all.
3856;Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.
3857;I will not tell you much about the movie itself other than the fact the story is compelling, the acting is excellent, and the director has the best knack for keeping you glued to the screen.
3858;I had her watch it again and she absolutely loves the movie.
3859;Give it time and you won't be sorry.
3860;One of the best movies of all time full of reality, bonding, drama and tears.
3861;Excellent performaces by Tim and Morgan with and excellent plot.
3862;I have to admit, I loved the idea of 'The Shawshank Redemption' .
3863;What's more prison is a wonderful communist paradise where all the felons are perfect angels and martyrs of the state.
3864;But overall it is a very good movie.
3865;this movie was well done, i recommend this to everyone.
3866;great actors and story line as well.
3867;as a sheriff's deputy i thought it was a great learning tool as well.
3868;We all know that this movie is ranked one of the best of all time, so I don't feel it is necessary to go on and on about how wonderful it is.
3869;My only advice in regards to enjoying the plot/storyline/etc is to read the novella by Stephen King first.
3870;This movie adapts the book flawlessly, while keeping almost everything in tact.
3871;It shows details and colors the way the director wanted them to be shown, it enhances movement, and blasts with glorious uncompressed audio.
3872;It is, ultimately, a new release in that no one has been able to watch this movie at home with this much clarity ever before.
3873;overall, this is a fantastic movie and a top notch blu ray release.
3874;If you've never seen The Shawshank Redemption before, you owe it to yourself to witness a film masterpiece .
3875;but, I add, if you have never seen it before, you also owe it to yourself to read what is easily a masterpiece in the literary world as well.
3876;This movie has been around for a long time now and there are plenty of reviews on it.
3877;I'll just say that it is one of the best movies I have seen and recommend it with the caveat that it does get into some intense moments.
3878;I didn't expect to like The Shawshank Redmeption very much, but I was pleasantly suprised.
3879;Frank Darabont is a genius, give him a story and he gives you a real movie.
3880;This prison drama shows how much talent movie.
3881;makers have as the cast, the director, the screenwriter and even the production designer make an impressive and engrossing performance.
3882;the Shawshank Redemption is an immediate classic .
3883;It will get to you big time.
3884;Violence is part of the movie, it has to be to appreciate the well deserved (and served) justice at the end.
3885;Well, I saw it and yes, its an extremeely good film.
3886;The acting is flawless, the script hole.
3887;free and really keeps you interested throughout the whole film.
3888;The story is a simple, but engaging one and I really could find no fault with it whatsoever.
3889;If there is anyone who has not seen this yet(like me up til a few days ago) I would definately recommend you watch this.
3890;One of my favorite movies of all times.
3891;The performances by the entire cast are superb.
3892;The Shank is an awesome movie period.
3893;I conveys the meaning of hope!
3894;Well this is on my top ten best movie list (I don't know where, it's not in order) This movie is a great movie that has message.
3895;And an inspiring movie .
3896;It is a tincy tiny bit overrated, because everyone think this is THE BEST when there are also other great movies(Schindler's List, Deer HUnter, Apocalypse NOW) out there.
3897;But it is as good as everyone(well almost everyone) says it is
3898;What a wonderful movie this is!
3899;I watch it every time it's aired on TV.
3900;The story and actors were all perfect for the roles they played.
3901;I'm happy that I finally own a copy of this great movie.
3902;Luckily I happned to watch it a few years ago.
3903;A tremendous tale of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity and the tough times life places before us.
3904;This is one of those movies that leaves you feeling like you have experience something powerful.
3905;It was the perfect revenge.
3906;I definitely recommend watching this movie if you've never seen it before.
3907;A great addition to any film collection.
3908;Shawshank is a great movie.
3909;It has a great mix of good acting, comedy and an awesome plot.
3910;Every change from the book's content made this movie better than the book, and that is rare.
3911;This is my grandsons favorite movie and he wanted us to share it.
3912;We both love this movie.
3913;This is the best movie ever made.
3914;Outstanding story which have elements of hope friendship and love.
3915;He gives us this by giving strong characters and excellent story which is hard to come by these days.
3916;newman's soudtrack goes hand in hand.
3917;This movie is, by far, the best movie I've ever seen.
3918;And the ending is super!!
3919;It's always fun to see the underdog come out on top.
3920;This is a feel good movie for sure.
3921;"Incredible insights to how ""systems"" work and how you need to handle yourself to be able to work within ."
3922;"The Shawshank Redemption starts with two introductions, presenting both of our main characters, Andy Dufresne and Ellis ""Red"" Redding."
3923;Of the many characteristics of a film, themes are only a fraction of what makes this film fantastic, but with the two simple themes of hope and freedom.
3924;Both scenes reject their freedom, but from there, it keeps building positively.
3925;Just with this image, the theme of freedom produced is almost tangible.
3926;Thinking about getting out of jail after 19 years is unimaginable until the final feeling of freedom is revealed.
3927;the second theme is hope.
3928;He is released (another example of freedom), but then experiences the same feelings Brooks does.
3929;I hope I can make it across the border.
3930;I hope I can see my friend and shake his hand.
3931;The Shawshank Redemption offers so many more examples for hope and freedom than the ones used here.
3932;There is always a new idea, theme, example, concept, or characteristic able to pick out every time the film is shown.
3933;I've seen it countless times and the two simple themes continue to stand out and support each other through new.
3934;A recommendation to all, a drama never to be forgotten, and a movie that will enthrall new.
3935;and audiences for years to come, The Shawshank Redemption leaves a warm feeling of satisfied resolution.
3936;This movie is a classic and will be recorded as one of the best movies ever(by professional critics and us reviewers).
3937;This movie has you cheering(or shocked with happiness) at the end.
3938;Soon to become a timeless classic, the Shawshank Redemption is , in my opinion, one of the greatest movies of all time.
3939;There he meets a go.
3940;From their first meeting, the onscreen chemistry is perfect and the subtleties that play out between the both of them is enthralling.
3941;It is great and good movie
3942;The best movie one worth watching over and over again.
3943;It leaves you with a good feeling, many people I think would like this one.
3944;This is one of my all time favorites.
3945;I manage to watch it at least once or twice a year.
3946;Not because it is a family film but because it is a classic.
3947;This is a brilliant movie.
3948;directed and, well, great in message.
3949;is the highest rated film on IMDB.
3950;It's one of the films many wish they saw it at the theatre.
3951;"so your ""helpful"" votes are greatly appreciated."
3952;I've just noted the general theme.
3953;Wow, what a powerful drama.
3954;"With terrific acting and a compelling plot, you are caught up in the life of an innocent man accused of murder and sent to the notorious ""Shawshank"" prison in Maine."
3955;this is the kind of movie that you will walk away from feeling inspired about the determination of human beings not only to survive but to triumph.
3956;They think it's the greatest movie ever made.
3957;I think it's a fine movie in many ways.
3958;Over all, it was an entertaining movie, though.
3959;I bought this movie because I read the book Differnt Seasons (by Stephen King) that has this story in it.
3960;The book was great and so was the movie.
3961;This is one of the few movies as good as the book.
3962;This 10th Anniversary edition has a beautiful, rich, vivid and sharp transfer.
3963;While there's some minor digital blemishes, it looks remarkably crisp with a faithful reproduction of the original theatrical appearence of the movie.
3964;He befriends Red (Morgan Freeman)while on the inside and begins quietly trying to rebuild as close to a normal life as possible behind bars becoming a good friend to Red's circle of friends as well.
3965;the first disc consists of the movie with a great commentary track from writer/director Frank Darabont.
3966;He also discusses some of the changes he made to King's novel to make it work better as a dramatic presentation and the challenges of casting, performance and location shooting.
3967;It's an enlightening commentary track that educates as much as it entertains.
3968;"the second disc includes ""The Charlie Rose Show"" segment devoted to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and features Darabont, Robbins and Freeman in a great discussion on the making of the film."
3969;It's clear that all involved enjoyed working together and that atmosphere carries over to the film that they created together.
3970;"We also get 2 marvelous documentaries
I:8414;3971;Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature examines the powerful impact of the movie and features a number of prominent critics and individuals that both discovered this powerful movie when it played in cinemas and on home video.
I:8414;3972;It's not as involving as the first featurette but does give a wealth of detail about the reach and scope of a work of art when it touches an audience in a unique, personal way.
I:8414;3973;we also get the comic spoof of the film """"The Sharktank Redemption"""" which is actually quite funny."""
3974;I hadn't seen this before although you'll appreciate it best after having watched the movie.
3975;It's quite a good book and would be a great reference for film buffs.
3976;It's also got a wealth of insight some of which will be worthwhile to film students and hardcore fans of the film.
3977;is this a great movie?
3978;"In many respects, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" reminds me of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life""
I:8414;3979;One of my favorite movies.
I:8414;3980;And a special release at that.
I:8414;3981;Thank you for getting it to me in perfect condition and perfect timing.
I:8414;3982;The movie was as wonderful as the novel (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption).
I:8414;3983;Whitmore was excellent and the Warden (his name escapes me) was superb.
I:8414;3984;An incredible job all around.
I:8414;3985;definitely a movie to add to any collection!
I:8414;3986;This film is a classic, and I wont review it here, Ill just say, the digibook packaging is beautiful, and if you do not have this film on blu ray, Id suggest you get this edition.
I:8414;3987;this movie is all time classic and looks great in blu.
I:8414;3988;will look forward to watching it time and time again,
I:8414;3989;There's a reason it's widely considered one of the best ever.
I:8414;3990;I would recommend EVERYBODY see it at least once!
I:8414;3991;If you love this movie as I do.
I:8414;3992;Its nice to own and add to mycollection to view whenever I want.
I:8414;3993;Shawshank Redemption is a film so worthy of your attention.
I:8414;3994;Exceptional performances from the entire cast, plus a storyline so engaging that you will find it hard to walk off.
I:8414;3995;One of my favorite movies, a must see.
I:8414;3996;A beautifully told story and you feel like you really know the characters.
I:8414;3997;Well acted and superbly directed.
I:8414;3998;Excellent movie shines even brighter on blu ray.
I:8414;3999;A worthy addition to any cinephile's library while remaining satisfying to the average movie fan.
I:8414;4000;I loved this movie and would recommend to everyone to watch
I:8414;4001;is a pretty good adult movie.
I:8414;4002;i KNOW THE Scenes are real life stuff, but do not subject kids, adolescents to it.
I:8414;4003;They have all tried to relay to you the remarkable experience that this film provides upon viewing.
I:8414;4004;But a triumph over adversity.
I:8414;4005;his banking skills gain him some sense of freedom, yet he is still lost and hollowed my his loss of life, Only hope pulls him through and it is his inspiring journey, that breath's life into us all.
I:8414;4006;This is a must see movie.
I:8414;4007;Based on a book by Stephen King, as always, very entertaining.
I:8414;4008;this is a repeat viewing, maybe my 3rd or 4th.
I:8414;4009;They were impressed and I enjoyed as much as the 1st time.
I:8414;4010;I really enjoyed watching The Shawshank Redemption.
I:8414;4011;It was great to be able to watch it without all the commercial interruptions.
I:8414;4012;The ending was brilliant, only Steven King could think up such a fine ending and only Frank Darabont could make such a great adaption as Stephen King carefully picked him to direct.
I:8414;4013;You will love this movie.
I:8414;4014;Also, if you liked this movie you will also fall in love with the brilliant The Green Mile , also written by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont.
I:8414;4015;Our world is a parable, a metaphorical prison.
I:8414;4016;The best of us uplift ourselves, our companions, and our surroundings.
I:8414;4017;But that how it is with truly great people.
I:8414;4018;marvel at Andy Dufrense's (Robbins) triumph in this first.
I:8414;4019;It's a tad condescending toward the Bible through the character of Warden Norton but remains an excellent movie (based on a Stephen King short story).
I:8414;4020;The truth that one has to slog through much feces to find redemption vividly comes to life.
I:8414;4021;this is an interesting film that i have watched many times and i will without being bored.
I:8414;4022;the shawshank redemption shows us the importance of HOPE and it is a serious work i think"
4023;Once again when Morgan Freeman is one of the main characters along with Tim Robbins you can only expect fine results.
4024;The sad part is Brookes taking his own life.
4025;To me the best movie ever made is The Clockwork Orange, such a gruesomely true movie (not the treatment part of it.)
4026;you must happy to this edition.
4027;Because tranfer picture very AMAZING !
4028;it is my favorite movie, because I am Andy Dufresne.
4029;Andy is just unique enough to be the outsider, and just normal enough to be the spokesperson for a species.
4030;As we stand (Andy united), we hold on dearly for the soul, and we encourage our hero to do the same.
4031;what the filmmakers of Shawshank have created is Life, at its lowest.
4032;Watching yourself on screen becomes the most intimate cinema experience of a lifetime.
4033;Feeling yourself escape becomes the most important experience of a life.
4034;This film is truly a masterpiece.
4035;Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were great and delivered perfect performances.
4036;It's a very moving film, told from the perspective of Red, another convicted murderer and Andy's best friend, whose first impression of Andy is that a stiff breeze would blow him over.
4037;This is one of the best films I have ever seen and would strongly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.
4038;They play truly believable parts.
4039;Andy, Red, and the rest of the prison crew are people that you grow to like at an early point in the movie and you really hope that things turn out okay for them.
4040;When a filmmaker makes you really feel for the characters he's done his job.
4041;It appeals to every type of movie, it's suspenseful, it's funny, it's even romantic (in a friendship sort of way), it's just a great drama.
4042;I've seen this movie on television several times and enjoyed it greatly.
4043;This film looks great and is guaranteed to make you smile.
4044;Frank Darabont (Green Mile, The Mist) wrote and directed this film with a great cast.
