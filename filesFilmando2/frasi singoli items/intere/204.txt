I:15842;1;The best movie I have seen in a long time Have watched it a few times and never get tried of it It brought home what the people of Ireland had to go through and the heartache
I:15842;2;Bloody Sunday is a well filmed show that brings to light of one of the most tragic events in Irish history.
I:15842;3;Any one who is Irish, and knows exactly what happened on that faitful day, can now get an up close and real feel of what it was like to face the British para's, while peacfully marching for equal rights, in a land whose boundries were gerrymandered by the British.
I:15842;4;The movie is very acurate, showing that the British first shot on the defensless Irish.
I:15842;5;We took the family to Ireland and Northern Ireland this year and toured Derry.
I:15842;6;This movie was such a help for us to understand what happened on Bloody Sunday.
I:15842;7;This is a gripping piece of cinema that it is very involving and very sad.
I:15842;8;It's hard to watch some scenes and it really is an extremely emotional film, and one that presents a side of the event that is sometimes overlooked .
I:15842;9;namely the lives of the people involved.
I:15842;10;This is a very strong movie.
I:15842;11;Very interesting and also very sad.
I:15842;12;This is an absolutely brilliant film that truly brings to life the events of January 30th, 1972 in the town of Derry, Northern Ireland.
I:15842;13;This film is presented in a documentary style and covers about 24 hours in time from the planning the day before the march until the bloodshed ends the following day.
I:15842;14;the story is told from two vantage points, the marchers and the authorities.
I:15842;15;the bottom line is this is a great film about a subject that while it happened over 40 years ago is still fresh in the minds of the people of Northern Ireland.
I:15842;16;held cameras) lend an air of reality and the incredible sadness.
I:15842;17;It held my attention the entire time.
I:15842;18;I was dissapointed with this film, I bought it hoping to watch a very powerful movie about a piece of Irish history worth noting.
I:15842;19;This movie deftly explores the massacre of January 30, 1972 using a documentary format, edited in a manner to make you feel like the events are unfolding in real.
I:15842;20;The documentary style lends the movie an authenticity which you rarely find in mainstream movies.
I:15842;21;This makes the effects of massacre feel incredibly visceral.
I:15842;22;Movies like this are dangerous and exhilerating precisely because they have the ability to conflate the reality of the event with the drama of the film, but they also have the ability to be reckless in their representation of events.
I:15842;23;Irish Parliament member Ivan Cooper is organizing a huge peace rally to get the Brits out of Northern Ireland.
I:15842;24;The slick sheen of the Bourne films is replaced by the immediacy of the cinema verite style here.
I:15842;25;this is a powerful movie.
I:15842;26;If you have the stomach for this kind of horror, it's well worth your time.
I:15842;27;irish relations for both subjects.
I:15842;28;Til this day the North is War Zone.
I:15842;29;Its a sensitive subject which was taken on with brave film making.
I:15842;30;i really liked the whole home made look to the film it was really effective.
I:15842;31;"I understand that the producers wanted this mockumentary to be as close to ""the real tying"" as possible but they might also have kept in mind that the film, as dialogue."
I:15842;32;"i also question the motives of the filmmakers in putting together a feature film that ""fools"" the viewer into thinking it's a documentary."
I:15842;33;Kudos to the brilliant acting jobs by known and unknown actors alike and laud the choppy camerawork, which was right on the money.
I:15842;34;handed since this actor is routinely cast as sadistic military types and has probably never played a sympathetic role in his life.
I:15842;35;i personally would rather see a balanced documentary of the actual event, so that I can know for certain that what I'm seeing truly happened.
I:15842;36;An important peice of Irish history which has been covered up by the British, which the world should be aware and not ignorant of!
I:15842;37;derry, North Ireland, January 30th 1972.
I:15842;38;the striking film is one of these relevant gems of the cinema.
I:15842;39;Awarded with the Golden Bear Prize and absolute winner of the Sundance Film Festival in 2002, remains as one of my twelve top choices films of the decade.
I:15842;40;a stunning portrait from start to finish.
I:15842;41;"Very dramatic without being a ""Hollywood"" type of film."
I:15842;42;This march will help bring attention to the plight of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland.
I:15842;43;Emotions run high knowing this is a story based on an actual tragedy that will always be in the hearts of Northern Irish Catholics.
I:15842;44;director Paul Greengrass does a remarkable job of making the film seem like an actual live newscast of events.
I:15842;45;This makes the film all the more realistic and unnerving.
I:15842;46;It's like a few cameras are in place and we are cutting back and forth from one side to the other.
I:15842;47;IThe film is jarring in its realism and it is painful to watch knowing what is going to happen.
I:15842;48;It is a brutally realistic film made all the more disturbing knowing the massacre actually occured.
I:15842;49;james Nesbitt is a fine Irish actor who appears in many British shows and films.
I:15842;50;One more film on this Bloody Sunday, will you say.
I:15842;51;Shot for television in 2001.
I:15842;52;And we have to keep in mind it will take more than 25 years to finally start moving towards a political settlement.
I:15842;53;as for this film and its content, I was quite impressed with the realistic portrayal.
I:15842;54;I loved when one para corrected another para by calling them 'terrorists'.
I:15842;55;It took the South Africans many, many bloody years to gain their freedom.
I:15842;56;"Paul Greengrass, who brought us the powerful and controversial ""United 93,"" made a stunning film about the events that transpired on January 30, 1972 in Londonderry."
I:15842;57;Greengrass presents the film in a documentary fashion, giving the impression that you are observing the events as they take place.
I:15842;58;The film clearly implies that the British shot first, though that's something that may never be determined with certainty.
I:15842;59;the acting and direction in this movie are top.
I:15842;60;Even though the viewer knows what's going to happen, one feels a certain amount of suspense.
I:15842;61;The interment issue has an eerily contemporary ring to it, and this film shows the dangers of a militarized police force.
I:15842;62;In sum, this movie is highly recommended, both for history fans and those who want to use the lessons of history to change the future.
I:15842;63;Watching the film recreate the events of January 30th is a gut wrenching experience, especially as the marchers near the barricades in the Catholic Bogside neighborhood.
I:15842;64;Simultaneously, we see the British soldiers planning their response to the protest.
I:15842;65;Bloody Sunday is shot using hand held cameras and dramatic fade.
I:15842;66;ins to add a dimension of slowly unfolding tension to the actions of the characters, and it works.
I:15842;67;Whatever your view, Bloody Sunday is a gripping film well worth watching.
I:15842;68;This is an important movie, especially for those of Irish.
I:15842;69;I loved the cinematography in this movie.
I:15842;70;It gives the effect of actually being there.
I:15842;71;"The tragic riot known as ""Bloody Sunday"" is recreated to powerful effect in this film, shot in pseudo."
I:15842;72;documentary style by Paul Greengrass.
I:15842;73;"While not for the faint of heart, ""Bloody Sunday"" serves as both highly visceral shocker and edifying political drama."
I:15842;74;If you are a Northern Ireland Historian, this is an extremely good movie.
I:15842;75;Now I'm pleased to see this film.
I:15842;76;He does an excellent job as a wheeler dealer politician who then becomes dumbfounded at the day's results.
I:15842;77;smith does a marvelous job as the boneheaded Gen. Robert Ford who goads the British into the confrontation and then crows about it as a tremendous success.
I:15842;78;because this film is about an extremely important event, one that is unfortunately mirrored in too many unjust situations around the world, it does have a universality and resonance.
I:15842;79;Even so, it's a film that deserves to be seen.
I:15842;80;This is a great honest movie.
I:15842;81;It had the courage to tell the truth that only now is being told.
I:15842;82;The film is shot in an almost documentary style which really gives you a great feel for the events of that horrific day.
I:15842;83;All in all a very real and moving look at a day of shame when 13 innocent people were massacered on the streets of Derry.
I:15842;84;True to both sides involved.
I:15842;85;A must for those interested in irish history.
I:15842;86;Special features are very good as well.
I:15842;87;This is a superb movie and one that I will use in future training for my soldiers and officers.
I:15842;88;Having done riot control on several occasions I can tell you that the military scenes are absolutely realistic.
I:15842;89;The movie does very well portraying the chos and uncertainty of this type of operation.
I:15842;90;Leaders really have to keep an eye on their people to keep them from getting trigger happy.
I:15842;91;Your only hope is that his discipline holds.
I:15842;92;this movie is a great tutorial on what happens when that doesnt occur
I:15842;93;"Bloody Sunday is a remarkable and powerful film
I:15842;94;This is such a well.
I:15842;95;done and important film that has the ability to re.
I:15842;96;create history with pure authenticity.
I:15842;97;Bloody Sunday is a documentary.
I:15842;98;What I do know is that this film was done in a very realistic and authentic way, and I believe that what happened on that tragic day might've gone down the way it did in the film, or very close to it.
I:15842;99;I also believe that the movie shows both sides, not just one.
I:15842;100;this film was done entirely hand.
I:15842;101;The end result is that it gives it the raw and realistic feel that it needs to be affective.
I:15842;102;That may not sound like a lot, but when you view or hear them, you feel very satisfied.
I:15842;103;They want to educate us all on what happened and they want us to confront it.
I:15842;104;It is a rare and unique gem that takes historical films to a new level that it has never reached before.
I:15842;105;All in all, a movie worth seeing.
I:15842;106;the movie presents a unique cinematic experience by shifting back.
I:15842;107;the rawness of the movie provides the viewer with no comforts, which causes a tremendous feeling of shock and loss due to the sheer injustice carried out on the day.
I:15842;108;Paul Greengrass has delivered the seminal cinematic essay on the origins of Ireland's troubled history.
I:15842;109;this is a gripping film shot in cinema.
I:15842;110;This was arson of the soul.
I:15842;111;Noble human values were bought, sold , subjugated to one side's polemics or another.
I:15842;112;This was the singular event that brought all the snakes back to Ireland, and Greengrass films them in an unblinking fashion.
I:15842;113;Jim Nesbitt leads a remarkable cast.
I:15842;114;The truth is that it is a British movie.
I:15842;115;Shots where heard and the army moved in with high velocity armed paratroopers turning the whole demonstration into a war zone.
I:15842;116;The whole scene was like something out of a nightmare with British soldiers moving along the streets in uniform motion taking pot shots at what they believed to be armed IRA members.
I:15842;117;"It is mostly one big ""action"" film that could also be compared to the likes of Black Hawk Down for its urban setting."
I:15842;118;It will certainly take you by surprise and is very well produced.
I:15842;119;This film does a great job of capturing the spirit and atmosphere of this historical event.
I:15842;120;The movie was made in 2002 and the film is so well.
I:15842;121;The acting is superb and based on what others have reported the movie has kept to a genuine protrayal of the actual story.
I:15842;122;One of the outstanding films of 2002!
I:15842;123;Now, three extraordinary filmmakers .
I:15842;124;writer/director Paul Greengrass, cinematographer Ivan Strasburg, and editor Clare Douglas .
I:15842;125;"Bloody Sunday is reminiscent of those great films from the 1960's like ""The Battle of Algiers"" and ""Z,"" wherein the filmmakers successfully recreate a moment of terrifying violence in purely cinematic terms."
I:15842;126;The camera bobs and weaves, becoming a major character in the drama.
I:15842;127;The filmmakers do an amazing job staging the complex action, managing to view the incident from widely varied vantage points .
I:15842;128;The crowd scenes are so well handled in this film that they could easily become a textbook case study for future filmmakers seeking to make movies in a similar vein.
I:15842;129;Greengrass also heightens the verisimilitude of the work by resisting the temptation to employ a background musical score.
I:15842;130;"Instead, the ""soundtrack"" of the film is composed of the perpetually ringing telephones that subtly reflect the extraordinary import of the moment."
I:15842;131;Nevertheless, he still manages to bring a few of his key people to life, particularly Ivan Cooper, a member of Parliament who organized the march, a man whose guiding philosophy is that people must have the right to protest peacefully to achieve social justice.
I:15842;132;headedness and his genuine concern for the people he represents.
I:15842;133;James Nesbitt does a beautiful job conveying the humanity of this Gandhi.
I:15842;134;Greengrass also allows us to see, in telling glimpses, the differing attitudes that prevail among the citizenry of the town as well as among the policemen .
I:15842;135;Indeed, there is nothing less than a superb performance in the entire cast.
I:15842;136;"(In an interesting moment of visual irony, the camera catches a glimpse of a movie marquee with the words ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" emblazoned on it ."
I:15842;137;one ideological and the other technical.
I:15842;138;There are some who may see the movie as somewhat one.
I:15842;139;Bloody Sunday is an exciting, brilliantly executed tour de force that reminds us of just how powerful cinema verite can be.
I:15842;140;This is, easily, one of the very best films of recent years.
I:15842;141;glad to see it has come to us here in the USA.
I:15842;142;its a must see, well done movie!!!
I:15842;143;the actors in it are class as well!!
I:15842;144;I saw the movie, and left the theater shocked, saddened, enraged, and bewildered, but with the firm impression that I had seen a truly remarkable film.
I:15842;145;the movie is shot documentary.
I:15842;146;the acting is superb, lead by James Nesbit as protest organizer Ivan Cooper.
I:15842;147;greengrass's camera leads you right into the middle of this battle, from start to finish.
I:15842;148;"The results are visually and emotionally jarring
I:15842;149;And at the end, almost as a reward for making it through the film, you are treated to a live version of U2's famously haunting song.
I:15842;150;Hopefully it will be honored in some other manner.
I:15842;151;Bloody Sunday is far from an uplifting movie but is definitely an important one, and nothing less than a marvel of modern filmmaking.
I:15842;152;This film is an excellent account of what happened on Bloody Sunday.
I:15842;153;This film shows a real account on what happened on this tragic day and it shows it fairly from both accounts.
I:15842;154;The acting was raw and very real as a lot of the actors in the shooting scenes were people who were there that day and the emotions they show was very real.
I:15842;155;The fact that it was shown as a documentary style film was to deliver as an accurate and believable film as possible and I think it succeeded immensely in doing so.
I:15842;156;And with regards to previous reviewers please don't make remarks on political issues you obviously no so little about.
I:15842;157;Efforts of the march's organizers leading up to the march along with several young men who participated in the march are captured.
I:15842;158;In addition, the military readiness of the British soldiers is also revealed.
I:15842;159;This movie unveils savage acts of the British soldiers as they fire upon the defenseless crowd.
I:15842;160;i recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in this horrific day.
I:15842;161;To the thoughtful and politically aware, these lessons have an unnerving relevance to the events of today.
I:15842;162;and if this was Mr Greengrass's aim, he succeeded admirably .
I:15842;163;james Nesbitt's understated performance is masterful, as is Tim Pigott.
I:15842;164;rending in the first case as it is infuriatingly convincing in the second.
I:15842;165;While I will not pretend that this is a pleasant evening's viewing, I will state with full conviction that is a necessity due to its powerful, compelling and honest depiction of the truth .
I:15842;166;but, maybe that's the point) I will say that the film feels amazingly real.
I:15842;167;that is, it is utterly convincing.
I:15842;168;Through a documentary styled presentation showcasing amazing and sharp acting performances, you are drawn in completely.you believe you are there.
I:15842;169;The picture is presented in a gorgeous anamorphic 16x9 transfer with solid blacks and crisp and tight (if intentionally muted) colours.
I:15842;170;The audio is likewise full and punchy.
I:15842;171;It is a fine example of what art can aspire to when embedded with a strong and passionate message.
I:15842;172;The film is shot in a documentary style.
I:15842;173;It makes the viewer feel like they are watching real life events as they happen.
I:15842;174;another propagandistic element of the film is it's appeal to the viewer's emotions.
I:15842;175;Bloody Sunday is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of the last 20 years.
I:15842;176;"There are a lot of films that touch on some aspect or events of ""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland, but Bloody Sunday is, far and away, the best of them all."
I:15842;177;The cast around him all perform impeccably.
I:15842;178;what makes the emotional impact so tremendous is the realism of the cinemetagrophy and dialog.
I:15842;179;The attacks by British Paratroopers on the civil rights marchers feel real, terrifying.
I:15842;180;held cameras, so the viewer feels as if he/she is right in the middle of the event.
I:15842;181;dramatic bit of dialog in the film.
I:15842;182;hearted or uplifting is to be found in Bloody Sunday.
I:15842;183;a pseudo documentary style recreation of the incident that took place between Irish civil rights protestors and the British Military in Northern Ireland.
I:15842;184;reasonably well made film though.
I:15842;185;It is simply astonishing the level of realism acheived within.
I:15842;186;Very engrossing and several good supplements including commentary and a visit to the present.
I:15842;187;life locations depicted in the film.
I:15842;188;Great movie exposing the out of control, anti.
I:15842;189;It is amazing and riveting just as good if not better than this movie.
