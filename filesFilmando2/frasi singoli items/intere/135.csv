1;This was a really deep movie that I thought was about how critical the role of fate is in our lives.
2;Another great message of this movie is what goes around comes around.
3;Jimmy knows the tragedy that occurs has something to do with something he did, and sure enough, it turns out it's true.
4;Sean Penn was intense, great supporting cast.
5;KB was great as always.
6;Great movie by Clint Eastwood, two thumbs up.
7;It absolutely stuns me that people liked it and gave it all those awards and missed out on the the wonderfullness of Lost in Translation and Bill Murray's oscar winning performance.
8;I even forgot myself and thought he was sexy for a few brief moments.
9;the characters Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon are excellent.
10;It is a real intellectual thriller.
11;the extras are good on this movie especially the commentary by Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.
12;They are pretty hilarious and that gives you a better understanding of the movie.
13;i would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy intellectual thrillers.
14;These three friends are played brilliantly by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and the underrated performance by Kevin Bacon.
15;These three actors reveal a side of humanity that is inside everyone.
16;Brilliantly directed by Clint Eastwood, Mystic River deals with the human emotions of grief and despair occuring from the loss of family and innocence.
17;the acting is tremendous, as you have no doubt read about from many major critics.
18;The saturated filming is downright vibrant in its murkiness, the same way as Se7en.
19;If you don't want to spend the extra ten bucks to have bonus material (though educational from almost every aspect), and the soundtrack then you should be happy with the single disc edition.
20;(check out A perfect World, Eastwood at his best.)
21;Mystic River is a good story, and it is what it is.
22;Mystic River is the type of movie I really wanted to like.
23;lawrence Fishburne has a nice screen presence, and does good because he's not given much to work with.
24;i also found this movie emotionless.
25;i also had to laugh at the people who said this film was thought.
26;This is not Eastwood's best film, but the acting is superb thanks to Sean Penn.
27;The performance that surprised me the most was Tim Robbins, he never stood out in his movies but this one he does and it's amazing.
28;This was a good one ended pretty strange though.
29;Mystic River is an amazing achievement in filmaking by director Clint Eastwood and its amazing cast.
30;Sean Penn gives an excellent performance, best of his career, as an ex.
31;The scene where he realizes his daughter is dead is amazing and heartwrenching.
32;Tim Robbins also gives a career best performance as a man trapped in a past he can't forget and his performance is the most haunting of the three main complex characters.
33;Kevin Bacon is a homicide detective and does a great job showing the pain his character feels over his wife leaving him and his inability to communicate and share his feelings make his charcter very interesting.
34;Bacon also delivers a career best performance.
35;Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden also have excellent performances as the wives of Penn and Robbins, and they both will be nominated at Oscar time.
36;Clint Eastwood does an amazing job as director, with the deliberately slow pace and dark settings.
37;this film will be one of the five films up for best picture at the end of the year and it should be.
38;It's a movie emotionally charged with situations that can be very dramatic, so the only way that this movie could have been well made, was counting with a good director and excellent performances.
39;thankfully Mystic River has an impressive cast that successfully contributed to create this complex movie.
40;Clint Eastwood managed to get an excellent performance from everybody in this movie.
41;From the big stars to the supporting cast, every actor in Mystic River did a terrific job.
42;without a doubt Sean Penn's performance in Mystic River is outstanding and he deserved every award that he got for his role of Jimmy Markum, a multi.
43;Tim Robbins is excellent in his portrayal of a very dark character, a man tormented by his personal demons, and his complex performance also granted him some nominations and awards.
44;This movie was a masterpiece of film.
45;The performances were better than first rate.
46;Tim Robbins was brilliant and Kevin Bacon as always made his character.
47;The mystery and the dynamic characters.
48;It's also a beautiful look into the mental process and how it can become damaged or skewed by some outside force.
49;It's tragic and saddening, but still so good.
50;As pointed out by so many others Mystic River is a powerful, emotional, well acted, well written film directed by Client Eastwood (Unforgiven, Play Misty For Me).
51;Without question this is one of the year's best films.
52;Of all the movies I've seen this year Penn delivers the best performance I've seen as actor give this year.
53;Unless something really amazing comes out in the next month Penn better win the Oscar.
54;Tim Robbins is right on target as well.
55;He delivers an Oscar caliber performance.
56;Other note worthy aspects of the film include the cinematography, the editing, and the adapted screenplay by Brian Helgeland based on Dennis Lehane's novel.
57;Mystic River tells the story of three young boys growing up in Boston.
58;And who knows what's the come in the future.
59;As I said before there is wonderful acting here.
60;The three men turn in fine performances by almost everytime Penn was onscreen I had goosebumps.
61;Penn shows a very wide range of emotions in this movie.
62;Now naturally I can't speak for everyone but I thought Linney was great in You Can Count On Me.
63;I find her to be an extremely talented person.
64;also spot Eli Wallach, Eastwood's old buddy in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in a delightful cameo.
65;line: An emotional powerhouse of a film.
66;Great acting, good script and fine directing by Eastwood.
67;Truly one of the year's best films.
68;One of my movie predictors is the trailer.
69;Try it out yourself and you'll see that it bears out most of the time.
70;I KNEW this would be a good film and I wasn't disappointed.
71;the acting is simply magnificent.
72;There are some interesting twists here and details that really make you sit up straighter as you try to puzzle them out.
73;You catch glimpses of behavior you see in the people you know and love.
74;MYSTIC RIVER may not be entertaining in the customary way, but it is engrossing, and all the performances are right on the money.
75;And i was happy to watch it again.
76;Id recommend it to anyone else
77;I think it's about time The Academy gives Sean Penn the Oscar he's deserved for years.
78;And Mystic River is the film that's going to do it.
79;Sean Penn gives his best performance, and one the best performances I've seen in years.
80;mystic River in an incredible piece of filmmaking.
81;Is it the Best Picture of the year?
82;the strongest aspect of the film would be the acting.
83;The cinematography does not rely on flashiness to tell it's story, and its subtlety is a real asset to the film.
84;And the script is just flawless, at least from a first viewing.
85;overall, a great film, that I believe has a great future in the box office, and will have great success as we get closer to the awards season.
86;The story this movie told was very interesting and Sean Penn played a good part.
87;i am not a big Sean Penn fan but I enjoyed this movie.
88;This movie was free though Prime Amazon provides a wonderful variety of vidios on demand like this.
89;Story is suspenseful with a twist towards the end.
90;PRO:First, the acting too me was overall great work.
91;So Robbin's character is very psycological and depressing and Robbins does a great job.
92;He's tough and seem to have good morals (is a good cop and even rejects a coworker's advances).
93;It got to the point and told the story nicely.
94;third, the initial setup of the movie is great.
95;So you go from feeling sympathetic for Robbins to disgust.
96;So although he unknowingly killed the pedophile he had the good intention and bravery of stopping the pedophile (confronting his past).
97;He holds all of the memories and anything related to it in his mind as to protect his family from the evils of child abuse.
98;free because Bacon as an ode to their friendship looks the other way.
99;And he gives Penn a gesture as if to say everything is fine now.
100;When the final shot of the actual Mystic River came up i just had a great sense of emptiness.
101;For my money, Mystic River is as close to a perfect movie as practically any Hollywood film I've ever seen.
102;that already seems to have considerable depth, it's also superbly adapted by Brian Hegeland with a screenplay that seems to add to the complexity, and it's flawlessly directed by Clint Eastwood.
103;One of the boys, Dave, is ordered into their car while the others watch.
104;She is found murdered the next day.
105;as a director, Eastwood veers between superbly assured films and other ones that don't really quite work.
106;I liked The Unforgiven, the improving adaptation of Bridges of Madison County, True Crime and Bird.
107;Tom Stern's cinematography keeps things looking gritty and down to earth, often leaving much of the screen in darkness.
108;And watch the performances that Eastwood has coaxed from everyone.
109;We both enjoyed this movie very much.
110;This is one of those movies that as a fantastic cast and a basically good story.
111;Sean Penn's performance was excellent and the talent all around really held the film up.
112;Having a surprise twist to it, it's one of those flicks that may not necessarily be one to own, as watching it over will only be to enjoy the acting as once the story is known, a lot of the suspense is going to be over.
113;that aside, this was a good movie and I give it a thumbs up.
114;Five stars to movie, story, characters, directors, actors.
115;it's a really wow movie!
116;Clint Eastwood job's really marvelous, I am really his fan.
117;it is really a wow.
118;i would recommend 200% for this.
119;what kind of a wife Celeste is also disgusts me.
120;She is more a human being than Jimmy's shameless wife.
121;This movie is surley at the top of his creation.
122;A great mystery involving childhood friends, each went on their own path and somehow they meet once again under the worst circumstances.
123;I love a film that captures the darkness in life.
124;That said, there is a fine line a film must be cautious not to cross before it loses the naturalness needed to convey the raw emotions it is attempting to stir up.
125;A film of this nature (one that is drenched in turmoil) needs to have characters that feel real and relatable and fully fleshed out.
126;Kevin Bacon has one of the films more poignant character arcs, yet his character is given nothing more than a side.
127;glance by the director, who seems less concerned with allowing us to feel the weight of the story's core and more concerned with lathering us up with wet and sticky distress.
128;I found Tim Robbins to be heartbreaking and sincere, even if I found his characters eventual arc to be a tad lazy.
129;Clint Eastwood applies his art in a masterfully plotted, directed, and acted production.
130;look at the scene with Tom Robbins and his wife while he is trying to confess to her, and then compare it with the penultimate one with Sean Penn and his wife, (You are the King, the King loves his children, and has to protect them. . . ) Chilling and profound.
131;are great pieces of craft.
132;the other thing to say here is that somebody has done their homework on Southie life.
133;these are all pitch perfect.
134;Robin Willams won an Oscar, after all, misplacing his R's in Good Will Hunting, even though he famously mangled his sentences beyond recognition.
135;give it a decent go (that's a rough ranking order).
136;The role calls for that and she delivers.
137;At one point during her Lady Macbeth scene towards the end, she's telling Sean Penn I can feel yo.
138;She said this a couple of times.
139;starts telling Jimmy that you can run this town.
140;Cant believe i waited so long to see this movie, intense with alot of twists and turns you don't see coming
141;Very suspenseful and kept my interest.
142;Would recommend seeing it, especially if you like Sean Penn!
143;I really liked this movie.
144;Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins were the perfect cast for this film.
145;This is one of the Best movies from the last decade!In one film you have the magnificent directing and acting along with a stunning and surprisingly story with characters developing in the course of the movie.
146;There is nothing creative about this film at all.
147;Usually I can't stand him but in this film he's probably the most convincing.
148;It's funny to see him cast as a store clerk who was robbed.
149;This is a movie about how complicated creature a man (or a woman, for that matter) is and how unpredictable his actions are at times.
150;director Clint Eastwood has another potent film under his belt, following his western homage Unforgiven and classic romance The Bridges of Madison County, to name a few.
151;born daughter and the other is a policeman assigned with the case.
152;the film has a haunting atmosphere .
153;packed, rather elegiac, yet suspense abounds.
154;Sean Penn shines as Jimmy Markum in his ruggedly emotional, dynamic portrait of revengeful father.
155;But it has its considerable visual poetry and Eastwood's directing is trademark.
156;The picture drags a bit in the second half, yet the multilayered ending makes it well worth the wait.
157;A must see movie, if you are a Clint Eastwood fan.
158;Awesome movie, Sean Penn is great as well in his role.
159;This movie is absolutely riveting.
160;Sean Penn delivers the performance of a lifetime and Tim Robbins also is very good.
161;I highly recommend this movie.
162;The ending without giving anything away leaves one saying well justice wasn't really served.
163;However for those of us that would give it a bad review because it wasn't fair in the end don't really want to see a true portrayal of life.
164;In the end the ending might leave you a bad taste, but it is true to life.
165;Watch the movie I guarantee you will be entertained.
166;How many more movies do we have to see with disagreeing cops?The actors are pretending they are acting in a great movie.
167;Mystic River aspires to transcend its genre so boldly that I found myself overwhelmed by its audacity.
168;Like all great works of art, the heart and soul of this work is not its plot, but its characters and its themes.
169;The result is one of the most powerful explorations of tragedy to come out of modern cinema.
170;It is unsparing in its intensity.
171;This is an intelligent film for mature people who refuse to put up with cop.
172;perfect performance, is tormented by even crueller demons, and never finds any sort of relief, save for transient moments of grace with his son.
173;This film is a modern work of art, sharing a deeper kinship to masterful psychological studies like Heart of Darkness or Crime and Punishment than to any crime story.
174;Allot of the cast are seasoned actors!
175;The plot of the film I a good one, however.
176;His level of emotion is great.
177;The story is good and the script was good too and if you dont feel some strong emotions watching this movie, then something must be wrong with you.
178;I'd actually give this film 3.5 stars.
179;In short, it was an absorbing movie that held my interest throughout.
180;first, I thought the mood setting elements were excellent.
181;Eastwood convnicingly brings us to a working.
182;and the acting really was top.
183;Robbins thoroughly deserved his Oscar for his deeply moving performance, and Marcia Gay Harden as his wife was also riveting.
184;i thought Mystic River did have a few plotting difficulties, and that keeps me from giving it 4 or 5 stars.
185;still, the movie was a solid and entertaining effort from Clint Eastwood .
186;Great story, great acting, and solid direction from Eastwood
187;This was the best movie of 2003.
188;I do feel that Lord of the Rings was very good also, but this movie should have won best picture and best screenplay (adaptation).
189;Lord of the Rings will be classic entertainment and will be to my kids what Star Wars was for me.
190;Eastwood is right on the mark with this movie.
191;The characters are devious and wonderful, tragic and beautiful.
192;I went to see it because the cast that director Clint Eastwood assembled is incredible, and the story is motivated by character.
193;sean Penn is absolutely brilliant playing a neighborhood ex.
194;It's a role that seems like the sort of part Penn has played well before, yet there are layers to his character that are fascinating to watch.
195;I saw where the film was pretty much going from its opening moments, and it went exactly in that direction.
196;rounded as the other leads.
197;in supporting roles, the amazing Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden play the spouses of men caught up in a bizarre murder mystery.
198;Linney's closing speech at the end of the film is so good that I wished the film had more moments with her in them.
199;Harden's final scene is compelling and heartbreaking.
200;The acting was superb with Sean Penn taking home the Academy award as best actor and Tim Robbins as best supporting actor.
201;A king knows what to do.
202;The river has many depths.
203;I really liked this movie.
204;Held my attention and had a great story line.
205;Penn delivers a real solid performance in this mystery murder film.
206;A decent entertaining melodrama, but very far from great.
207;Eastwood's overall direction is competent, but not outstanding.
208;Tim Robbins does an excellent job of portraying a tortured soul.
209;In any event, one viewing is enough.
210;I was immersed in the feel of reality that only the best talent can bring to the screen.
211;Deep, sometimes dark but always compelling, this great film had me wound around its finger almost from the start.
212;Tim Robbins is nothing short of brilliant.
213;The pace is perfect, the characters more than believable.
214;This is one of the best movies I have seen in years.
215;Lots of action it this movie.
216;I think the fact that many other people like it, besides the cast, is that the stories in the movie can relate to real life.
217;Sure the acting is great, but what good is it with such a tragic story.
218;I'm a fan of the novel Mystic River by Dennis Lehane and read it twice before I saw the movie.
219;The cast was excellent, the photography was great, the locations were good and the sets were very believable.
220;dennis Lehane's novel is a complex, multi.
221;faceted urban tragedy, full of living breathing caracters, with multiple subplots.
222;really enjoyed movie and the acting was great also.
223;A fantastic story, and will be watching this movie again from time to time
224;I have seen this movie several times and each time there is something new about the characters to learn and understand.
225;i love movies that are character driven and this one is great
226;i felt that Dave one of the main characters should have gotten some psychiatric help for what happened to him when he was a young boy, because it was obvious that things do sit and fester in one's mind.
227;That's why it's so brilliant.
228;Penn and Robbins earned their Oscars with the dept and truth they brought to their characters.
229;Eastwood is a master at filmaking, and this is definitely a masterpiece.
230;The most amazing performances by the most amazing actors.
231;This was an emotional journey for me that was absolutely engrossing.
232;it is one of his all time favorite movies and he was very happy to finally have his own copy!
233;It succeeds brilliantly, and is a benchmark for movies where character and not plot take center stage.
234;In contrast, Mystic River has enough of a plot to keep things moving, and it's interesting.
235;second, you must have a good script.
236;Here, the screenwriter really created some memorable characters and great dialogue.
237;you must have great actors to breathe life into your characters, when your characters are your movie.
238;Robbins, Bacon and Penn have never been better, and each do a fantastic job.
239;Their performances are engrossing, and keep the film from dragging.
240;This is definitely in my top 5 movies of all time list.
241;Extremely well directed and a dynamite cast with very strong and powerful performances.
242;I kept hearing about how great this movie was and how it how it had Oscar written all over it.
243;the truly only outstanding performance is by Tim Robbins does.
244;This elite cast is directed by Clint Eastwood.
245;The story is meaty and suspenseful.
246;That dialogue is usually important in a movie or play, and in this film, it is critical.
247;As any high school drama teacher will tell you.
248;All of the actors turn in very good performances, particularly Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Marcia Gay Harden.
249;He carries himself with sadness, and his internal rage and confusion show in his face and body.
250;Her fear grows as she comes to believe that her husband may have murdered a 19 year old girl.
251;In this scene of ultimate betrayal, Harden is at her best.
252;Penn turns in a great performance.
253;But hey, if that doesn't bother you, you'll probably find this to be an outstanding, disturbing, impactful film.
254;There is actually no mystery as to why this meaty novel, brimming with tragic characters, attracted top.
255;Jimmy is a devoted husband, Sean is a detective and Dave is a family man.
256;this movie is incredibly gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
257;The other cast members also contributed to this.
258;this movie is such a good movie and a near masterpiece.
259;mYSTIC RIVER is powerful, painful and deserving of its praise as one of 2003s best movies
260;Truly riveting, the watcher is taken through the lives of three friends torn apart by one event that changed them forever.
261;Winner of two academy awards, Mystic River is the one movie to see, and to appreciate for the true artistic composition of Clint Eastwood as he weaves together yet another classic for the ages.
262;First of all, a round of applause, please, for Clint Eastwood .
263;In Mystic River he handles a lot of potentially gratuitous subject matter with dignity and grace.
264;There are also some startlingly good performances here, most notably by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.
265;So yeah, Mystic River is a very weighty film, but it is also a very good, very POWERFUL film .
266;Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)From its first release I have always loved this movie.
267;Now I enjoy the movie even more because I know more details about the characters and their histories.
268;Good drama with top notch actors.
269;A very tense story to really hold your interest all the way through.
270;The plot, acting and true to life twists and turns in this drama made me sit on the edge of my seat throughout the film.
271;Great actors, good script and exciting!
272;I should rate it five stars I just can't do it.
273;I mean that in a good way of course, the story is just riveting!
274;I think Tim Robbins turned in the best job of his career here, well he also did good in that Shawshank film and that was also based on a book.
275;Well enough of that and back to Mystic River, a movie that has a lot of misunderstandings between the people in the movie.
276;I do not care for Sean Penn but anything he does is good, the best was probably though when he was in Fast times at Ridgemont high.
277;I think this movie is very well done.
278;The story and the characters portrayed are both excellent.
279;The grieving Sean Penn and the diligence of Kevin Bacon amongst the back drop of the small network of childhood friends, very well played.
280;The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.
281;well cast and extremely good acting.
282;Mystic River is a haunting and tragic movie that is extremely well written, acted, and directed.
283;Dave is abused but eventually escapes.
284;The mystery that emerges and the triangle between these three men is very well directed and acted.
285;It's a psychologically deep and dark film that lesser actors probably couldn't have pulled off.
286;this movie may not suit everyone's tastes but I would highly recommend it.
287;There are several outstanding features of Mystic River
288;He is fully alive in this role, as protective father seeking the murderer of his elder daughter while simultaneously dealing with his intense grief.
289;His wife, Laura Lenney, describes him best in the final minutes of the film, when she emotionally absolves him of the murder of a childhood friend he mistakenly believes killed his daughter.
290;She evokes the Jungian archtype of the king as she tells him he is a king who protects his family and home and that he acted on the best evidence he had, even if that evidence is flawed.
291;The interaction of the three main actors form the structure around which all the tragedy flows.
292;underlying the plot however is the themes of justice, revenge, and our connectedness in a web of relationships.
293;The film asks whether justice can ever be obtained and is it right to take justice into our own hands.
294;In this case we see two men try to take justice into their own hands, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, and the tragedy that unfolds because of that.
295;In the final scenes a softball parade goes through town, the characters lock eyes, knowing that an impure justice has occurred with which they all must live and the young son of the deceased Tim Robbins, sitting on a float in his softball uniform, implies that it will cycle through again, unresolved, because justice and revenge are structures of human interaction and relationship, not absolutes.
296;Directing and acting were both good.
297;A riveting movie, with some rough spots, but overall, a thoughtful, deliberate and successful story.
298;It's a slice of working class life in a working class town, where there is no escaping the past.
299;Do things always turn out with some kind of poetic justice, and how is good and bad defined with respect to each other.
300;This movie is well deserving of all the attention, accolades, and positive reviews that it received.
301;Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon, were excellent in this movie.
302;I even enjoyed Marsha Gay.
303;Tim Robbins performance was great when he cried for his life and to make things right with his wife.
304;Marsha Gay Harden was wonderful in her performance.
305;The story was good also
306;To be honest, I had higher expectations.
307;Nothing remarkable with the cinematography either.
308;well, what came through though was undoubtedly the professionalism of the all.
309;Penn delivered an incredible performance, yet sometimes he tended to overact.
310;Robbins, who totally managed to capture his character, took my breath away with his powerful playing.
311;my experience with the vendor is successful because the arrival time was good the protection of article was correct and arrived without a scratchthanks
312;This movie takes you to a side of life that's hard to look at, yet in such a compelling way.
313;The story, directing and acting are superb!
314;overall the movie seemed believable to me and was well acted.
315;Clint Eastwood delivers another good movie.
316;I see an enormous amount of films and I usually tend to agree with the majority of critical opinions, but not this time.
317;I'm no actor, but to see Sean Penn in anguish over his daughter is the most unintentionally funny performance of the year.
318;With a stellar cast, murder, betrayal, and suspense, Mystic River delivers.
319;totally loved how everyone BUT the cops were solving the murder.
320;Great movie and a great story!
321;Mystic River is a great movie.
322;and I must say that I was so moved by the movie that I sat and watched the screen for five minutes after the whole thing was over .
323;Sean Penn was incredible as Jimmy.
324;O my goodness, the emotions he went through were so REAL and excitingly believable .
325;I am a Sean Penn fan for LIFE!Kudos to Clint Eastwood, dude has put together two very nice movies .
326;That said, he put his best foot forward with this one, you simply can't go wrong with this movie .
327;I would recommend others to watch but definitely wouldn't put it up there as a great movie.
328;One of the most critically received films of 2003, MYSTIC RIVER came across to me like a fairly diverting murder mystery dressed up as a prestige film, the latter fact more thanks in large part to the pedigree of the cast and the film's director than the assumption that it's a great movie(it,in fact,is not).
329;Still, the acting is fairly seamless across the board.
330;penn is excellent, though frankly was better in 21 GRAMS, but fellow Oscar winner Robbins' performance didn't move me whatsoever.
331;The two best performances for me were from Marcia Gay Harden(as Robbins' conflicted wife) and Bacon(who makes understatement a perfected art here).
332;sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon star in this excellent murder mystery, directed by Clint Eastwood.
333;Kevin Bacon is still great as the detective, Laura Linney is great as Jimmy's overbearing wife, and Marcia Gay Harden is impressive as Dave's submissive wife.
334;All the characters are terribly realistic, and human, and that's what makes this movie great.
335;And furthermore, this movie touches upon the ongoing violence occurring with teenagers.
336;A movie that kept my interest the whole time.
337;Up to a point the film is beautifully directed and filmed.
338;That's at least two problems for this 'true to life whodunnit' that great performances from Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon can not overcome.
339;Bacon and Fishbourne were good.
340;This is a great movies that has a lot of twists to it that keeps you on your toes.
341;Sean Penn is fantastic in this film.
342;The acting was very good, however the content was hard at times.
343;Clint Eastwood makes great movies.
344;They are all a little long, but he tells a great story and really pours some detail into character development.
345;Great story line and phenomenal acting!
346;Terrific acting, great cast, great plot.
347;Boston is one of the stars, and the story shows how the pain of the past can twist our humanity.
348;This film keeps you guessing through the entire movie.
349;Eastwood didn't do so well speaking at the Republican Nat'l Convention, but he's a great director.
350;Mystic River is a textbook example of how a very good film could have been a great film with just a few changes.
351;First and foremost, the ensemble cast is just incredible.
352;Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne are terrific as two Boston staties on the search for the murderer of Penn's daughter.
353;Clint Eastwood directed it like a veteran of film would: with well.
354;shot visuals, focused and straightforward.
355;It's possible the film would have benefitted from some more experimental and lively camerawork, but it works well the way it is.
356;I liked this movie a lot.
357;Clint Eastwood does a superlative job in directing an extremely fine cast in his gloomy, foreboding portrayal of Dennis Lehane's poignant novel.
358;both Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden give convincing performances as Penn and Robbins's respective wives.
359;This awesome scene is reminiscent of James Cagney going ballistic in White Heat, one of the most classic scenes in cinema history.
360;the appearance of Eli Wallach, one of the most accomplished character actors of all time, as the liquor store owner was a terrific reunion with Eastwood (not since The Good, The Bad and The Ugly).
361;It is a truism in the world of soap opera (the purest form of modern melodrama) that the characters must always do the dumbest possible thing to propel the story forward.
362;Yet, a large portion of film today is pure melodrama.
363;Mel Gibson, Ron Howard, and Kevin Costner (Academy Award winners in direction) come to mind, as does Clint Eastwood (another Oscar winner).
364;There are some nice touches.
365;More often the script, by Brian Helgeland, merely allows wallowing for the actors, and denies them any real chance to show real emotion.
366;So it is with the three main characters.
367;as for Sean, he was the most likeable up to a point, until you find out what a corrupt cop he is or maybe just too wimpy and intimidated by Jimmy to do what's right in the end.
368;There are numerous crime movies that are better with more likeable and believable characters.
369;All three main characters are sons of Ireland living in the New World.
370;Others liken MYSTIC RIVER to a cinematic dissection of middle class life.
371;Instead of keeping the people in this film at a distance and offering contempt for modern American life, MYSTIC RIVER holds these men in sympathy and respect while mediating on the theme of justice.
372;Sean is a policeman who works in a world of correct processes, written and codified rules, and a system of rights created to replace the justice of revenge and eye for an eye.
373;Civil justice replaces the hot.
374;Tribal justice sees revenge not as an evil but a duty full.
375;blooded men and women must fulfill.
376;but there is another justice that is unnamable and more savage at work in spite of the efforts and safeguards of human justice.
377;It is a power that flows into the lives of men and women from some unknown place whose purposes are never understood but rules far more ruthlessly and pitilessly than we can withstand.
378;mYSTIC RIVER is a tale of these three modes of justice weaving in and out.
379;Sean the policeman knows of the revenge murders Jimmy has committed yet keeps these secrets to himself.
380;At end of the movie, primordial righteousness has wrecked its justice in the lives of Sean, Dave and Jimmy.
381;More surely than justice, these change hearts and afford mercy.
382;likewise, Jimmy's wife responds to his crimes with love and forgiveness because she sees Jimmy's great heart and love for his family.
383;She clings to Jimmy because she trusts his heart.
384;While we have sympathy for him, Dave's own madness destroys him and threatens to take down all whom he loves.
385;the mysterious justice symbolized by the Mystic River rolled on and has done its work.
386;Its judgments are final and undisclosed to us.
387;And it is these words that bring his life out of unhappiness into a new and gentle place.
388;Lots of plot twists to keep it interesting.
389;Interesting story with a twist.
390;One of Eastwood's best directorial efforts ever, with superb performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins .
391;this movie is a classic, full of suspense and twists and emotional punches.
392;the great Clint Eastwood directed the film.
393;He had highly talented actors to work with in the roles of the three men: Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon.
394;All three actors immersed themselves in their roles and are brilliant.
395;Great acting and a good story line.
396;It is quite poignant so do not watch if already feeling sad or depressed.
397;Instead of devolving into a mundane murder mystery, this film adds a new dimension right from the beginning.
398;I have not read the book, although my wife has and she said that the movie followed it quite well.
399;The acting I must admitt was amazing, especially on the part of Tim Robbins who plays Dave Boyle, the grown man still trapped in the mind of the child he once was.
400;Now they are all grown and have moved on.
401;The story itself is gripping and the whole charactor study was wonderfully exicuted.
402;I was in tears by the end of the film (for more than one reason) for this is one of the most moving films I've ever seen.
403;Tim Robbins is the reason this film works so well.
404;just watching his charactor move you can see all that he is and you know that Tim became Dave Boyle.
405;and that is a good thing, a very good thing.
406;how Lord of the Rings beat this as best film of the year I'll never understand.
407;If you're looking for a movie that is intelligent and riveting, and will haunt you for awhile, this is a good one.
408;Mystic River was the first movie that I have ever watched that was directed from Clint Eastwood, and I am happy to say that it was worth the time.
409;Everybody is hurting in this movie.
410;While this movie is emotionally deep without spelling it out for us, it doesn't even hold a candle to how amazing the book is.
411;Easily Clint Eastwoods finest work, and also for the overshadowed and understated Kevin Bacon.
412;great filmmaking, directing, script, actors, etc.
413;Everyone does a superb job and together they create a film that will quickly become a classic.
414;a happy, Hollywood ending where everyone joins hands and dances around the Maypole?
415;But if you want an original film with a compelling storyline and complex morality, this film definitely satisfies.
416;The emotions in this film are real.
417;Robbins haunting performance at the end of the film is real.
418;Is it a happy ending?
419;But all of these facts point to the very reason that the film succeeds.
420;Especially if you are a family man, then this movie will speak to you and force you to think through difficult questions.
421;This movie had a nice plot, kept my interest, and had a surprise ending.
422;I watch the opening moments, meet all the characters, and think about it for a moment and of course I call the outcome 90% of the time.
423;It's a riveting and tense thriller, it's one of the best films of year and of course I went and ruined it for myself by figuring out the outcome about an hour before the movie ended.
424;It's about what ties us all together, how we face our demons, and the bonds of friendship and family.
425;acted film I've seen all year.
426;sean Penn gives the performance of a lifetime.
427;There is a powerful moment, as he must tell his wife (Laura Linney, The Life of David Gale) that his daughter (From a first marriage) is dead.
428;This kind of scene is very rarely powerful, in most films it's almost laughable, but all I could think was Wow!
429;clint Eastwood has proved once again that with the right material he can direct a film that is smart and well told.
430;MYSTIC RIVER is better than UNFORGIVEN, but these two films will be considered classics.
431;I liked how it unfolded.
432;Of course I loved the film, but I felt cheated by my own cleverness.
433;I sometimes wish I could enjoy a movie like the masses.
434;It's well worth two hours of your time.
435;Put together a great cast including Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins, add a spectacular plot and a wonderful director and you should get a fabulous movie.
436;Penn as Jimmy the family minded gangster puts in a magnificent performance, easily the best work I have seen from him.
437;Many of the scenes captivate you as you helplessly watch the tragedy unfold, Dave's face looking back from the car window is a graphic example.
438;The mood of the movie is right on the mark, you never feel comfortable, in fact unsettled is the correct description as you feel the menace floating over the river like mist.
439;Clint Eastwood recently won the Oscar for best director in Million Dollar Baby and, in this earlier effort, he showed how superb he is.
440;He had won an Oscar also, in 1992, for Unforgiven and this movie was snadwiched between the two and, truthfully, was as solid an effort as the other two were.
441;Meanwhile, both Sean Penn, winning best actor, and Tim Robbins, winning best supporting actor, were totally convincing.
442;As great as he was, his role did not appear to be as demanding as those of Penn, who plays a low level hood in working class Boston, and of Robbins, who is an emotionally damaged victim of a kidnapping/sexual abuse episode decades earlier when he was a child.
443;Robbins, whose character's name is Davey, seems pretty much to be a nonentity.
444;But then again, often life isn't always satisfying and what is portrayed is a gritty realism.
445;There is often debate as to whether an actor should be nominated for an Oscar as best actor or best supporting actor.
446;Robbin's role was major yet, he was nominated for and won best supporting actor.
447;It is certainly a wonder as to how the academy splits hairs between a lead role and a supporting role.
448;Having said that, I have the deepest respect for their acting abilities and my personal feelings do not weigh in.
449;I feel that they were both very deserving Oscar winners (given the fact that Robbins was in the supporting actor category).
450;The three main characters were best friends as kids but one day david got abducted and thsi evetn haunts them all to this day.
451;Once the opening shots of the city of Boston and the banks of the Charles River were displayed on the silver screen, the average moviegoer would most likely have thought, Hmm, I'm in for a real treat.
452;one, for its theme, and two, for its director.
453;The final revelation of the film .
454;It kept me guessing right up until the end.
455;I thoroughly enjoyed the cast of characters and the story line.
456;great direction (i love clint) terrific acting.
457;sean penn is masterful
458;the character developmenet in this movie is very very good.
459;more pleasure for the brain that for the heart.
460;Clint Eastwood has created a memorable tale of the consequences of the choices we make in life.
461;Emily Rossum is haunting as Jimmy's eldest and beloved daughter.
462;Clint is a master story teller and this is one of the best movies that had made in the last 20 years.
463;type directoral masterpiece from Mr. Eastwood and the stars Robbins and Penn.
464;I like to be absorbed by characters played with heart and substance.
465;Oh, how I wished I had read the spoilers first!It was tightly directed, though with a style and feel that echoed a much better film, A Perfect World.
466;bacon, Penn, and Robinson put in strong performances in their going nowhere roles.
467;I admired Eastwood's flair in A Perfect World, an emotional film that touched you on all levels.
468;well, you want to wash after watching it.
469;Quirky worked in A Perfect World, quirky worked in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
470;I have loved Eastwood since his Rowdy Yates days, and marveled all the films he has starred in or directed ever since.
471;Sean Penn was great, as usual.
472;The story line of childhood friends and staying in the neighborhood as they got older was familiar.
473;It will likely resonate with a lot of people.
474;Sean Penn gives an outstanding performance in his role.
475;Strong emotional story about karma and choices.
476;The movie, like the great book it was based on, is full of surprises, and is an emotionally charged.
477;tim Robbin and Penn definitely 100% deserved their Oscars here.
478;Then Clint gave us the Million Dollar Baby, which did it again!I'm happy to see great directors giving Kevin Bacon great roles.
479;Excellent acting very dramatic and great acting enough I already said great movie this is why people dont do surveys
480;It is common knowledge that each of us reads a novel from our own unique perspective.
481;I have never been a believer in channeling, but the notion fleeted across my mind when viewing this movie.
482;the actors performed incredibly, the score was excellent, just a tremendous movie to a surreal degree.
483;Clint Eastwood does a great job of getting the best out of some very fine actors in this urban working class instant classic.
484;Sean Penn, reminding me of some of the best work by such stars as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, is absolutely authentic as Jimmy Markum from the mean streets of Boston, a guy who brushed with the law, went straight, and then, when his beloved daughter comes up murdered, is tested and found.
485;Penn won an academy award in 2004 as Best Actor, and Robbins won as Best Supporting Actor.
486;Best film that year went to Lord of the Rings, but Mystic River couldn't have been far behind in the voting.
487;He also does a great job.
488;His sidekick is played by Laurence Fishburne who brings the very familiar black police detective role to a new level of excellence with his balanced and realistic portrayal.
489;the story itself is riveting.
490;Eastwood's direction is tight, focused, always believable, and atmospheric.
491;This movie is that good.
492;a couple of other things set this film apart.
493;One is the interesting and deep psychological situations that some of the characters find themselves in.
494;The difficulty results from a beautifully constructed story based on a realistic and believable plot that makes us feel when the truth finally comes out, that it is right and understandable although almost impossible to guess beforehand.
495;see this for Clint Eastwood who, with this film, can take his place alongside Hollywood's great directors, and for Sean Penn who gives the performance of his life.
496;make of Wild Things, a cop.
497;Sean Penn's English on 21 Grams was so clean.
498;Not as much storyline redemption as a slightly similar, also really good film, 'Crash'.
499;The main actors are really great, the plot is original and very interesting and the end is quite unexpected.
500;The passage of the film shows two possible ways of solving the crime involved in the film.
501;something more to say about Bacon's role.
502;The fact is that Penn's role is worth a nominee for Oscars, but I think that it's more deserved for a long career than for a master performance in this film.
503;And Robbins' role is quite as interesting as Penn's.
504;Hire it and you won't regret.
505;Oscar nominations,wonderful cast,incredible director,compelling story.
506;One of my friends kept telling me that I'd love this film.
507;That it was one of the greatest movies ever.
508;The cast of this film were quite convincing in their potrayals of characters,Sean Penn especially playing another darkly,intense character.
509;He deserved the Academy Award win for this film.
510;But I had to give it a big thumps up, because the performances
511;I thought Penn's Dead Man Walking, performance better showcased the full range of his talent.
512;I watched this movie in breathless anticipation of the good part to come.
513;Powerhouse performances by a skilled cast should keep most viewers riveted to Clint Eastwood's otherwise overlong and somewhat predictable neo.
514;Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Hardin and Laura Linney inject the film with much more life than the workmanlike script deserves, and these fine actors are well worth spending the time with.
515;paced and deliberate way of making films
516;great build up to a good ending.
517;I have just seen this one for the second time,and i think that i've enjoyed it even more than when i went to the theatre almost a year and a half ago.
518;i loved it then so much but now that i've read the novel too i understand it better and i can appreciate more the features of the characters
519;i have always loved Penn's acting (one of my 5 favourites actors ever!)
520;and the other 5 actors and actresses are brilliant too (i have to say that Laura Linney is a wonderful,talented as well as pretty actress too
521;Everything in between is fine too.
522;Plot was excellent really had you guessing!
523;PLUSES: Tim Robbins throroughly deserved his Oscar as this was the best character and on screen performance of his career.
524;All the performances were excellent (with the exception of Laura Linney .
525;see minuses) and it was a great cast.
526;The 120 great minutes of this movie was rolling along and going to be in my top 50 movies of all time.
527;Beautiful performances from the cast make this one the worthwhile film that is.
528;I enjoyed watching really good actors flex their muscles with strong tragic material, I guessed at the mystery and stayed glued to it until the end.
529;A big part of me felt removed from the story so the dramatic and emotional impact was severely lessened.
530;It was very good and worth seeing.
531;The story line was easy to keep up with and the surprise ending was emotional.
532;He is an outstanding director, who really knows how to tell a dramatic story.
533;the cinemataphy is amazing in this film as well.
534;Tim Robbins is outstanding in his role as a man who was abused in his childhood.
535;The circumstances are sad and disturbing, but the story is very well told.
536;Sean Penn is just amazing, and gives the performace of a lifetime.
537;if you want to see a movie that combines superior acting skils, with wonderful direction, and a dramatic storyline, this is the film to see.
538;It was such a great movie it was worth a second viewing.
539;It was a good movie though.
540;Great actors but the movie was slow and kind of boring.
541;All of the actors in this film were so convincing I felt like I was watching a real story.
542;Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins give excellent performances as does Marcia Gay Harden as the confused Celeste.
543;Clint Eastwood has done yet another great job from the director's chair !!!
544;With the ensemble cast, and well written script, this movie is Clint and cast at their best !!
545;It's uncommon to find some of the finest acting, scripting, and filmmaking that Hollywood can offer all within one motion picture.
546;That's what makes Mystic River so extraordinary.
547;Penn succeeds in realistically portraying the emotionally unstable Markum, which can possibly earn him his first Oscar after falling short on three previous opportunities.
548;spoken Dave Boyle, whose social disability is a result of being a victim of a disturbing crime as a child.
549;Although he hasn't received as much acclaim as Penn, Robbins is equally effective, if not, better at times in his performance on camera.
550;winner Marcia Gay Harden, who plays Robbin's wife, Celeste Boyle.
551;directed by Clint Eastwood, the filmmaking of Mystic River is what really puts it over the top.
552;Eastwood combines challenging shots with his self.
553;composed score to construct breathtaking scenes that otherwise, would have been less memorable.
554;mystic River contains all the components one wants to experience when watching a film
555;If there has been one movie worth seeing this entire year, Mystic River is an uncanny contender.
556;I enjoyed the ensemble cast for sure, but it was Sean Penn that made this movie fir me.
557;He made the character come alive and you felt everything he wanted you to.
558;I've seen it many times and will see it again.
559;Clint Eastwood shines in his directing skills.
560;Further, the actors accurately rendered speech, mannerisms, and the (noteworthy) Boston accent of the area.
561;Nonetheless, I recommend it (highly) for its excellent production, direction, cinematography, script, and acting.
562;It is an excellent movie and deserves all the awards it has received.
563;I love the work both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins do.
564;I always look forward to seeing Sean Penn, in a movie.
565;I didn'tfind the story very interesting, or anything else aboutit.
566;Clint Eastwood's adaptation of Dennis Lehane's wrenching best.
567;seller, Mystic River, is a remarkable achievement.
568;Having read the book shortly before seeing the movie, I was impressed with Eastwood's faithfulness to the letter and spirit of Lehane's story.
569;Jimmy now owns a grocery store, is a loving family man, and seems to have given up his criminal ways.
570;As a child, Jimmy was a close friend of Sean Devine, who grew up to become a homicide detective, and Dave Boyle, played by the wonderful Tim Robbins.
571;the stellar cast of Mystic River is amazingly effective.
572;Sean Penn's performance is brutal and heart.
573;rending, and Tim Robbins convincingly plays a man on the brink of madness.
574;eastwood wisely shot his film on the streets of Boston, and Tom Stern's atmospheric and skillful cinematography contribute to the film's realistic and dramatic look.
575;Mystic River is a powerful drama about how desperate people react when they are under tremendous emotional pressure.
576;Kudos to Eastwood and his fine cast and crew on making an exceptional film.
577;For a while I was worried I would never get a chance to see this movie in theatre's after hearing nothing but great stuff about it from family and friends.
578;So when Penn won Best Actor instead of Murray I was very pleased.
579;it's hard to pick out certain captivating performances since every single performace was worthy and equal in every way.
580;Penn's performance like always was thoroughly gripping and gut wrenching, especially the scene with him being held down by a mob/crowd of Boston cops when he finds his daughter dead that TV spots and trailers gave most nods and kudos towards.
581;Tim Robbins gives an equally captivating performance as the life.
582;Bacon's performance is also captivating as the detective assigned to Penn's case and torn between the loyalty he still has to his Robbins and doing his job to find the killer of Penn's daughter.
583;harding as the wife of Robbins is perfect as she gradually shifts from loving wife to finding herself scared of her husband for what she thinks he may have done to Penn's daughter.
584;Fishburne's performance as Bacon's partner was so.
585;i have yet to see Unforgiven, but Clint Eastwood has definitely made his place in filmmaking history by directing two movies that have both been up for Best Picture and Best Director nominations even if Mystic River lost.
586;Eastwood keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie and the ending sequence when you find out who really killed Penn's daughter .
587;He forces you to think throughout the entire film and then slowly fits in the remaining pieces of the puzzle for you towards the end to allow you to confirm or deny if what you were thinking about the murder of Penn's daughter was true or not.
588;The fact that Eastwood composed the score for the film made the movie even better.
589;I ended up leaving the theatre pondering over anything I could think of from this well crafted film.
590;It kept my interest until the end, and then, left me to wonder.
591;A very dramatic and suspenseful take on traumatic childhoods events and it's effect on adult life.
592;Sean Pean and Kevin Beacon are great as usual.
593;We thought the actors did a good job.
594;Because this movie was just so amazing and so great, that I want to explain to you in details what made it like that.
595;This movie had better suspense and a better storyline then most dramatic thrillers out there now.
596;the ensamble cast was terrific.
597;It begins with Jimmy and his friends Dave and Sean, all as kids.
598;Because they take Dave, claiming to bring him to his mother's house for ruining wet cement.
599;An unknown amount of years later pass and we see all of them grown up.
600;well Dave is messed up.
601;Plus the viewer knows for a fact that Dave saw Katie when she was murdered, so Dave becomes the prime suspect in the investigation.
602;It scared me, moved me, interested me, and wanted it to not end.
603;No storng violence is present, mostly implied, by the profanity is a little strong.
604;I loved everything about it.
605;The storyline that although is present in many movies that I have seen, is incredible.
606;You hope for everything to end up alright, you hope for all of these sick people to stop taking young children, you hope to stop the murders, and you hope of stop the violence and the everlasting battles between bad guy and good guy.
607;Definintly one of the best films of the year, and one of the best films that I have seen.
608;This movie is great because it tells a tale where nobody wins.
609;At the end of the movie, you're just left feeling bad for the situations created by the plot, and it's done very well.
610;i'm a hard and fast Eastwood fan, but this film surprised me in its layers of meaning.
611;In the ending you have two characters, the wives, whose presences up until then have been supporting, all of a sudden taking over.
612;i thank Eastwood for getting such great performances out of his excellent cast.
613;It was a very good plot!
614;Screwed up by telling 2 lies to cover himself.
615;This is a really great movie, I have told friends about.
616;It holds your attention and is a complete turn around of what you thought it would be.
617;Well Clint Eastwood has done it again!
618;He not only captures the essence of the book, but successfully turned it into an entertaining and enjoyable movie.
619;It's so sincere and passionate with some of the best performances I've seen from Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Marcia Gay Harden, and Tim Robbins.
620;The book was great and I love the movie.
621;This is just a masterpiece and such an amazing film.
622;I recommend this to anyone looking for a downright great movie.
623;The performances are so genuine and emotional with a brilliant plot.
624;Just a brilliant movie all around.
625;Loved the special features, and it arrived in perfect condition.
626;lots of F bombs, but excellent movie.
627;The dichotomy between Tim Robbins and Sean Penn is fascinating.
628;Penn adds just the right amount of edginess and sentimentality to this role.
629;Great story, great acting, and an engaging plot make this an awesome movie.
630;Mystic River is, by far, one of Clint Eastwood's finest films to date.
631;Adapted for the screen by Brian Helgeland (L. a. Confidential, Payback, Blood Work) from the book of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the writers take what typically would have been a simplistic murder mystery/thriller and turned it into one of the most engrossing, fascinating, and heartbreaking films I've seen all year.
632;Grief, as it always does, brings each of the men closer together, but ultimately results in tragedy for everyone involved.
633;hands down, this is one of the finest casts ever to be assembled on screen.
634;Each actor disappears into their roles with startling ease, leaving their big Hollywood names behind and truly becoming their characters, Boston accents and all.
635;We enjoyed this movie very much.
636;Tough, but good watching Not for kids to watch, but a really good movie.
637;The complex storyline and gritty cinematography truly is worthy of praise by film critics and moviegoers alike.
638;Tim Robbins put in a rich performance as the tormented Dave.
639;Marcia Gay Harden put in a wonderful performance as Dave's wife Celeste who believed that Dave was responsible for the murder of Jimmy's eldest daughter from his first marriage.
640;I never really took Kevin Bacon very seriously as an actor however I thought this was the best performance as Sean I have seen from Kevin.
641;Laurence Fishbourne (whom I forgot to mention earlier) was equally wonderful as Sean's partner.
642;Of all the actors/actresses in the film, I thought Sean Penn put in the most compelling performance as the ex.
643;I never got the chills like that in any movie until now.
644;Sean may be a difficult actor but the performances he puts in truly shines, especially in Mystic River.
645;As a result of his daughter's death, Jimmy is reunited with his old childhood friends Dave and Sean.
646;I loved Laura Linney as Jimmy's wife.
647;Marcia Gay Harden is wonderful in this film.
648;I immensely enjoyed the twists and turns in the film.
649;It truly fit the mood of the movie.
650;Mystic River certainly ranks as one of, if not the best film of 2003.
651;After seeing the film adaptation, I picked up the book today and I look forward to comparing the film and the book.
652;my biggest complaint was my wireless wasn't streaming it fast enough but besides that it was a fantastic movie.
653;Rarely will you see acting this excellent.
654;the film itself is quite good.
655;The screen play was well done and the actors made the drama captivating and engaging.
656;a dramatic film such as this could have easily been a throw.
657;Clint Eastwood does a fine job keeping Mystic River from being a formula.
658;Mystic River is probably the most powerful film I saw this year.
659;He plays his character so perfectly
660;It's an outstanding film directed by Clint Eastwood that gave Penn the Oscar he deserved.
661;I'm an action kind of guy but I enjoyed the suspense this movie offered.
662;I also think Sean Penn gave a riveting performance.
663;This film grabs the psyche of the audience and shakes it vigorously to feel and experience a wide range of emotions.
664;One of the saddest scenes in the film is Dave's tear.
665;Dave manages to escape .
666;The next scene occurs when Dave is an adult, playing baseball with his son.
667;The film explores the depth of passion that Jimmy experiences due to the murder of his daughter.
668;The complex lives and relationships of the main characters in this film create unusual depths which are plumbed in unsuspecting ways as the film draws to a close.
669;While the film was not what I expected, my appreciation grew for the subject matter as suspense built and as subtle details, provided throughout the film, came together and made sense.
670;besides the contemporary subject matter, this film has enormous appeal due to the wide range of emotional reactons expressed by its most powerful actor, Sean Penn.
671;His performance was deeply intense and highly charged with emotion throughout the film .
672;totally appropriate to the situations.
673;I can only compare him to Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman at their finest moments.
674;The next most impressive actor was Tim Robbins' portrayal of the psychologically disturbed Dave.
675;Marsha Gay Harden, who played Dave's wife Celeste, is the next in line for impressive performance.
676;Her portrayal of vulnerability and betrayal were superb.
677;Overall, this film is highly recommended if the viewer is willing to feel strong conflicting emotions and able to tolerate disturbing images required for the plot and storyline.
678;The way in which he and his past bear responsibility unfolds throughout the course of the film, which for all its intricacies and entertainment value and raw emotive power (the actors in this film are all excellent), still somehow leaves me frustrated and not quite completely satisfied.
679;Sean Penn is excellent because he is natural and comfortable in the skin of this character (and indeed all his characters).
680;Tim Robbins is excellent because he conveys what the entire undertone of the film is: discomfort, never quite feeling or being oneself again in the face of tragedy.
681;I enjoy films that have an underlying tone, and I got an ominous feeling from the way the events of the film unfolded.
682;still with the stellar cast in excellent roles, I would recommend this film.
683;What dynamic performances all the actors played their roles as if they lived their rolls.
684;The story line was dynamic, impactful, and powerful!
685;This is a movie I will watch many times again.
686;The acting was excellent and the plot carried out honestly.
687;I would recommend it to a friend.
688;This is a beautifully crafted movie.
689;The performances of the three major characters is for the ages and the level of deepness that they bring to the ordinary man is almost epic.
690;Eastwood has a great directorial control over every scene.
691;The story is dark but intricate and surprises you along the way.
692;Mr. Eastwood has made a film for the ages.
693;A classic movie that's power will stay fresh and vibrant 100 years from now.
694;the suberb script, phenomenal acting, and the subtle, distinct look of the cinematography all shine under Mr. Eastwood's confident vision.
695;When you mention all the great filmmakers.
696;john Ford, Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, John Huston.you can now add a new name.
697;thank you Mr. Eastwood for making a REAL movie for adults.
698;It's not a happy story, and lots of really bad things happen in it, but it leaves one with a knowledge of two sides of the story and a sympathy and area of respect for all the characters.
699;I was very impressed by the casting and performances, and the Oscar nominations and wins are very well deserved.
700;The mood and setting were perfectly captured on film.
701;Dennis Lahane is a masterful writer.
702;He lived much of what he wrote about and he tells it in a fresh and magical style.
703;He brings Boston to light as it really is and his characters fit in so well.
704;(This novel is right up there with Stuart O'Nan's Prayer for the Dying.
705;ranging opinions of its worth.
706;I found this film to my liking, although I didn't cotton to the ending.
707;In order to enjoy this movie, one must have an attention span longer than 10 seconds, and one must enjoy drama that doesn't involve shooting and exploding and car chases and action that is unrealistic/absurd.
708;The story is realistic, and the acting is superb.
709;This was a great film.
710;As I was watching it, it was easily a 4.4.5 star film.
711;It was suspensful and very well shot/directed.
712;The story line was a great one, and all the technical aspects of the film were perfect.
713;It's a great movie, and definately worth a watch, but you'll be shaking your head as the credits start to roll.
714;liked it a lot, a lot of plot twists andd totally unexpected ending!
715;a good drama should move you, should make you feel shaken and this film delivers.
716;The script is very good, the actors all excellent.
717;sean Penn gives a tremendous performance that is worthy of all the accolades.
718;Following close to him is the evocative and always disturbing impressions we see in Tim Robbins' character.
719;While it is not pleasant these things do happen and the story is told in a believable way.
720;On the other hand, acting at this level rarely happens by such a stellar cast and in such a well orchestrated manner.
721;The movie is sad and tragic, enthralling and entertaining.
722;Sean, David and Jimmy are best friends growing up in the Boston area.
723;tim Robbins gives one of the finest performances of the film as the older David Boyle, a man haunted by events of the past.
724;Marcia Gay Harden is equally fine as his wife Celeste, unsure of her husband's fragile mental state in light of Jimmy's daughter's murder.
725;top with the portrayal of a father devastated by the murder and determined to take matters into his own hands.
726;Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon make a great team, working well as two cops on the trail of a killer.
727;clint Eastwood's direction is good, but he should have ended the movie sooner than he did.
728;the movie is definitely worth seeing, if only for the fine performances of Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden.
729;A very interesting story about shame, ego, loss, and love.
730;kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn were all very good.
731;nice jobClint on directing this film.
732;give it a solid 4!!
733;Academy award winning performances by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and (imho) the under.
734;This is a gritty, tough, revenge.
735;Very good movie but was not in High definition.
736;whoever says this is a classic.
737;It was an excellent movie, without question.
738;term Clint Eastwood fan and I found this movie to be amazing.
739;His professional growth over his long career has been astounding.
740;term story and exceptionally well done.
741;The results are deeply tragic in every way, and yield a crushing emotional ending to a superb movie.
742;everything about this movie is good.
743;The filming is first rate.
744;The musical background is excellent.
745;The emotional impact is stunning.
746;Interesting story line with interesting twist.
747;Clint Eastwood is doing a decent job using skilled artist in appropriate roles
748;Clint Eastwood's 24th journey as a director delivers a powerful and moving story about the true hurts and aches of loss.
749;For those who still think of him as the actor in Bad Boy and At Close Range, you need to see this film, if for any reason, just to see the true maturation of a brilliant actor.
750;He brings to life a very dynamic and complex character, one who is tought and intimidating one moment, and then the next is a broken.
751;This film is very deserving of all the accolades it received last year and is one of the few times that a great director and great ensemble cast come together and actually create a great movie.
752;MYSTIC RIVER is one of director Clint Eastwood's better films.
753;The story told through unforgettable imagery is mesmerizing and leaves the viewer's mind in a subterfuge of disturbing what.
754;This is a downbeat yet powerful soul.
755;Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Kevin Bacon are truly extraordinary in their roles.
756;Tim Robbins showed greater depth as an actor than I ever thought possible.
757;He was entirely believable and convincing.
758;Sean Penn's performance was brilliant.
759;I believe that the performances really drive this film.
760;There is a certain amount of reality in them that makes this film come down on a personal level.
761;This is a very moving film and one that lingers with you.
762;Watch it and see whar the plot really is.
763;But this is a most important and searching question, for it focuses on the crux of the film.
764;eastwood confronted his part in the portrayal of the West in UNFORGIVEN, and in MYSTIC RIVER he asks us to do the same, to face our own hearts of darkness.
765;is it a great film?
766;at times very good, at other times risible.
767;Nevertheless, it deserves serious attention for its disturbingly important (and brave) subtext.
768;MYSTIC RIVER ranks with the finest films created in the past few decades.
769;Clint Eastwood directs this harrowing story with a quiet brilliance that cuts right to the message of the film: everyone has an inner darkness which propels us to surprising acts at unexpected times.
770;This film is more Theater than movie in its intensity: the story and character development are primary and the visuals and camera work, though spellbindingly superb, are tools for Eastwood's commitment to finding the psychological core of every aspect of a group of people whose lives intersect in this almost unbearably bitter bit of truth.
771;three boys playing street hockey on the neighborhood street in the Flats near Boston share a commitment and comraderie that is so strong that it doesn't need dialogue.
772;The suspense and development of the crime investigation are so razor sharp that revealing the ending would be a crime against those who have not yet experienced this movie.
773;the cast is impeccable and under Eastwood's direction gives some of the most thoroughly realized, brilliant performances on film.
774;Timothy Robbins as the mentally fragmented and fragile Dave is extraordinary, Sean Penn as Jimmy gives a performance of passionate power and pain and anguish, Kevin Bacon's understated protrait of Sean the investigating cop is the epitome of subtlety, Marcia Gay Harden shines as Dave's terrified, tremulous wife, and Laura Linney is steely perfection in the small role of Jimmy's embittered yet supportive second wife.
775;All of the cast, including Laurence Fishburne as Sean's cop partner, have successfuly adopted the Boston accent.
776;Every member of the supporting cast is exceptional and Eastwood knows how to pull natural acting from people whose experience is to this point limited.
777;is consistently captured by the cinematographer and the dialogue of the peerless screenplay never drops below perfect.
778;Boston can be a pretty dark place.
779;When I sat to watch this, I found it sooooo enjoyable!!
780;This movie is a good movie.
781;If you like movies with proven star power, movies that keep you guessing, movies that hold your interest throughout the movie, this is the movie to watch.
782;Superb acting, lots of action, and a surprise ending.
783;After an inital meeting where they all share their grief, the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds.
784;Robbins is especially good (and deserving of his Academy award) as the man who was molested as a young man, and who is permanently scarred because of it.
785;This is a disturbing, brooding film, one of Eastwood's darkest (even darker than Unforgiven), but it's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received.
786;It keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the whole movie.
787;Wonderful story and acting direction, I would recommend it to anyone into detailed and nuanced artistic works.
788;Acting is uniformly great and Director Clint Eastwood has an ocean of emotion to work from.
789;The characters acted predictably and stayed true to their stereo.
790;The 2 stars are for the relatively good acting and for the directing.
791;The actors and acting was well done.
792;This was a well done mystery.
793;WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERSMystic River is a misunderstood masterpiece.
794;His only sin was having Dave and Celeste for a father and mother.
795;such a cheery little movie.
796;I'm surprised it did so well in tragedy.
797;Sean Penn, and Best Supporting Actor .
798;It takes a while for events to pick up and characters to start opening up.
799;The feel of the movie and accuracy helps set the location very well.
800;The ensemble cast is a big who's who of a generation in Hollywood.
801;Since Clint Eastwood prefers to get everything done in one or two shots, you know actors had to step up their game and that makes the performances a little more impressive.
802;He just always finds a way to look so.
803;His facial expressions and tone of voice are so eerie.
804;sean Penn's daughter played by Emmy Rossum (who is beautiful and innocent as always, this was her first notable role in a big film) is found to have been murdered.
805;He brings out the raw emotion at the drop of a hat and his performance is very compelling.
806;marcia Gay Harden plays Tim Robbins's wife and stays in the background looking worried and scared most of the movie.
807;Laura Linney plays a great grieving stepmother and makes a big character turn that comes out of left field at the end of the movie.
808;The comparison of marital relationships from which is most loving to which is most likely to last is interestingly ironic.
809;take style of directing, and the accuracies of where they shot the movie.
810;The part of the extras I enjoyed the most was commentary with Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon.
811;I always enjoy actor commentary the most since I have a background in acting in theatre and film myself.
812;Wow, this movie started great and had me thinkin who did it form the beginning.
813;There was a great cast, and some great acting by Tim Robbins, but.
814;it disturbed me so much that I have to give it a 2, since I will never by choice see this movie again.
815;without a doubt, the best thing about the film is Tim Robbins.
816;Once again, he proves his worthiness as an actor, drawing both compassion and fear from the audience as well as a sense of discomfort.
817;This dark and somber picture deals with a sensitive and awful sexual abuse.
818;Add the physical wounds the unforgettable traces left in the mind and the soul.
819;eastwood reached the peak as hard to beat director
820;The cast is simply terrific.
821;And the absorbing photography is another invisible actor.
822;Great movie not for the little ones.
823;mill drama that yet again shows the wide range of crying, weeping, and sobbing SEAN PENN is always capable of.
824;He and the supporting cast do a decent job of bringing their characters to life, but the story doesn't give you a chance to really like any of them.
825;This is a wonderful movie!
826;I would recommend it for the drama lovers!
827;some people will love this film for specific aspects (die.
828;With a superb plot about the interrelated lives of three childhood friends, this movie has the emotional depth of classic Greek drama.
829;the actors are top notch, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins fully deserved their acting Oscars.
830;The directing is superb, Clint E. would have deserved a directing Oscar.
831;the movie, in my view, tells the story better than Dennis Lehane's novel.
832;My eyes are glued to the screen with good movies, but you can take two or three naps during Mystic River and not miss anything.
833;The best parts were when the overacting was beyond belief.
834;Mystic River is a triumph for Clint Eastwood.
835;Truly a moving film, Mystic River never lets your eyes wander from the screen as you're completely focused on this very disturbing story.
836;A film capturing the adult lives of once childhood friends, played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon, you watch as they come together once again after what appears to be many years of brief and intermittent run.
837;This is definitely one of the most intriguing mystery films I've seen in a long time.
838;fans of those earlier mentioned should really enjoy this film.
839;There are also some excellent and shocking performances by Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden.
840;I highly recommend this film.
841;wrenching (perhaps even angering) subject will attract any looking for a solid dramatic mystery with some very memorable characters.
842;Even though Sean Penn has the second ugliest smile in Hollywood (Second behind Sly Stallone), he still put in a helluva performance.
843;was it worth the wait.
844;All of them perform very well, especially Robbin's who has always struggled to shed his 'nice but dim' typecasting.
845;And Eastwood's direction takes its time and builds the story at a deliberate, unrushed pace.
846;Great movie originally written by a great author Dennis Lehane.
847;Sean Penn is perhaps one of our finest actors.
848;I first saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and knew I wanted to see it again.
849;I enjoyed it again even after several years later.
850;Disturbing subject but very well written and acted.
851;This is a good and interesting story, a little predictable, but good.
852;This is probably the best way to describe it: instead of seeing an actor playing a character, you see someone acting like an actor playing a character.
853;Take the words away, and he is just a parody of a dramatic actor.
854;I guess he's at the same age when DeNiro was doing lots of his really good work The trouble is we've seen all that truth in acting stuff and it's an actor's job to connect with the character.
855;I've done lots of it.
856;And Sean Penn does the same level of work, albeit good work, that thousands of actors do if they're doing their work well.
857;This movie is my favorite, along with fight club and trainspotting.
858;Movie was pretty good up until the ending, Sean Penns character is not arrested or shot dead in the street by Dave's wife bothers me.
859;I've been waiting to watch this movie for over a decade and finally got around to seeing it and it was amazing.
860;It's rare to see a film this good.
861;Mystic River is an instant classic with phenomenal performances by its entire cast, from the star trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon, all the way down to the three youngsters who play them as children in the opening sequence.
862;Meticulously crafted and perfectly cast, the film packs an incredible wallop, from the beautifully shot opening scenes that set up the incredible tragedy to follow, to the well.
863;One thing is certain: it is impossible not to think about and discuss all that has been witnessed, and that's what great films are all about.
864;What is important is what has happened to that point.
865;Suffice it to say, it is one of the most eloquent statements against child abuse and for the importance of dealing with childhood trauma I have ever seen, embodied by the sad, broken shell of a man played beautifully by Robbins.
866;Whether or not you believe Penn's performance is the best in decades, like some critics have suggested, one thing is certain: he and Eastwood have achieved the kind of legendary collaboration that evokes the memory of Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront or, more recently, Martin Scorcese and Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and Raging Bull.
867;Linney, in particular, has the film's knockout (and most discussed/maligned) scene in which she evokes the spirit of Lady MacBeth to justify Penn's actions, while Harden beautifully underplays the role of tortured spouse who suspects her husband of a heinous act.
868;In fact, these two films make a great double feature, since the themes are similar.
869;Helgeland skillfully adapted Lehane's novel with economy and impeccable instincts on what to leave intact and what to streamline.
870;Joel Cox's editing is crisp and professional, and the production design is stunning.
871;present river in which all the secrets of the film are buried.
872;penned music, I find it absolutely inobtrusive and appropriate to the mood of the piece.
873;in all, Mystic River is an absolute masterpiece and one of the few films in recent memory that deserves to stand alongside the great dramas of the early '70's, including Chinatown and The Conversation.
874;disc special edition, which includes a beautiful wide.
875;Also, Robbins and Bacon contribute a commentary track where they discuss Eastwood's directorial style, which they found refreshing and beyond reproach.
876;A pure urban story that fits within the urban boundaries of a blue collar neighborhood.
877;One of the best films I've seen in a while.
878;Perfectly cast and great acting.
879;Good movie and another one I that is part of Amazon Prime so I can stream it for free.
880;Eastwood has become an exceptional filmmaker and this movie, although flawed at times, is one of his best.
881;He also composed the film's melancholy score.
882;winning screen writer Brian Helgeland has done an exceptional job at adapting Dennis Lehane's superb novel.
883;star cast of actors, how can one go wrong?
884;This film is a must.
885;clothes cop, approaches them and gives them grief about messing up the sidewalks.
886;He orders one of the kids into his car, saying he'll drive him home where he belongs.
887;Sean Penn's Jimmy, whose grief and seething rage lie beneath a calm exterior, is the most interesting of the movie's characters.
888;But the camera returns to Dave, time and again, as the tension builds.
889;There is tremendous intrigue, and Bacon and Fishburne do an excellent job with the murder investigation, but I did feel let down when the answers finally came in.
890;As a study of character, friendship and buried secrets, this is strong and substantial film.
891;Great story about life and great actors.
892;For some reason, I had never seen this movie before and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
893;This movie was well acted, and I'm sure directed well, it's just not my cuppa.
894;I need to see some good resolutions, not just twist after twist and each move brings someone else down
895;This ia a very powerful film with excellent acting, especially Sean Penn's performance.
896;It is much better than I remembered.
897;I usually watch only 1/2 of a movie each of 2 nights but this was so good I watched it straight through.
898;importance and some will still argue whether or not the hype (and subsequent Academy Awards) is justified, however the honesty and emotions running through the film make it one of the more memorable films of it's time.
899;The movie's very raw and there is no happy ending for any of these characters.
900;top is very solid and believeable.
901;blown his quiet intensity rings true through the rest of the film.
902;Kevin Bacon is a great actor but I felt Sean was a bit under.
903;It sort of gives the feeling that Dave deserved to die simply for being a child.
904;so while Mystic River is far from the flawless masterpiece it claims to be it is a very powerful film.
905;The best part is the acting of Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon.
906;I usually don't care for those two, but they are engaging and believable in their roles.
907;I had heard of this movie years ago and since I grew up in the Boston area I thought I would watch it.
908;A good drama comes rarely, and when it does , it always moves me.
909;I found the characters in this film to be very real, and original.
910;If you plan on doing something like this, make it relevant to the main story somehow(the case).
911;All action arises realistically and without pretense because of the conflicts between the characters.
912;Not your average good v evil movie
913;I read the book and it slides a bit from the book but is okay to watch.
914;When Tim Robbins and Sean Penn won Academy awards for their roles in Mystic River, I just knew I'd see the film sooner or later.
915;Plus, I love Tim Robbins' progressive politics anyway.
916;I loved Robbins' dorky look and I loved Penn's muscular torso, gray temples, and big hair.
917;I love the way that sports balls falling into sewers was a metaphor here.
918;In fact, they should have played it up more.
919;The characters were well developed and the acting was superb.
920;Mystic River is an emotional and amazing film about the reconciliation of three friends and their wives by the tragic murder of Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie Markum (Emmy Rossum).
921;Twists and turns and changing plot lines makes this story brilliantly unpredictable.
922;the acting is bar none and has been recognized by the Academy by awarding Sean Penn and Tim Robbins best actor and best supporting role at the Oscars.
923;Sean Penn was incredible in this film.
924;He was so into his character.
925;To love his children and to be the best father he can be.
926;Penn is perfect in performing this role.
927;Tim Robbins is also and incredible actor.
928;He kept himself bottled and up.
929;An ensemble cast also included: Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Haden, Laurence Fishburn.
930;mystic River is truly amazing.
931;Clint Eastwood is an incredible director.
932;He has tackled everything from commercial potboilers (Absolute Power), romantic tearjerkers (The Bridges of Madison County) and somber westerns (the Oscar winning Unforgiven) with equal degrees of thoughtfulness and visual flair.
933;In the mesmerizing Mystic River, Eastwood uses his considerable talents to tell a haunting and thought.
934;each of the main characters has been warped and disturbed by violence, and the bulk of the film is devoted to the gripping examination of their defects.
935;awaken his human compassion and sensitivity.
936;Penn, Bacon and Robbins each explore every nuance and motivation of their characters with depth and sensitivity, and in a perfect world they would all would have received Oscar nominations.
937;Outstanding move with a heck of a twist at the end!
938;This a dark story, a remarkable interpretation of Lehane's novel.
939;If you read the range of reviews here it almost entirely has to do with taste.
940;The trailers were enticing as well.
941;Some have said it's a valuable critique of vigilante justice.
942;Very twisted plot, really made you think.
943;Amazing performances be the actors.
944;Sean Penn delivers a powerful performance in possiable one of the biggest let downs since lost in translation.
945;This just like lost in translation was sworn up and down by movie critics everywhere to be such a great and powerful film.
946;It starts off great and fast, a girl is killed in the first few minutes (which is always nice), and then the next hour or so you spend your time waiting and wanting something else to happen.
947;Mystic River begins with great promise.
948;It is photographed excellently with great overhead shots and scene blocking.
949;there are some great moments here.
950;director Clint Eastwood recreates the shock and disbelief that comes with unspeakable tragedy very well and he does an excellent job illustrating a fathers trauma and the very sad and surreal hours after the initial murder.
951;For such a compelling opening and build.
952;Implausible chains of events, past relations and a perfect storm timeline that confuses investigators.
953;there are some great support roles.
954;Eastwood does wrap things up nicely, though , with a couple of well acted/directed scenes that are very thought provoking despite the plot defects.
955;One of the best movies I have seen!
956;The plot and storyline is excellent and edgy paired with outstanding acting.
957;Dave Is A Prime Suspect.
958;this Movie Is Unpredictable And Allot Better Than The BookWhich Was Excellent Also.
959;A Marvelous Movie That EveryoneShould See.
960;Excellent performance from ALL lead actors.
961;Well directed and well written.
962;This explains how the actors turn the characters into charactertures of human beings, by exhibiting over the top method acting.
963;Making Clint a total legend in his own mind and in the minds of his adoring fans, who say he can do nothing wrong!
964;A scary movie, but well dome by Clint Eastwood!!!
965;Great acting, great writing, great direction.
966;Great minor characters, those two in the bar with Tim Robbins, I've known guys like that.
967;everyone is at the top of their game, especially Sean Penn.
968;honestly I was almost laughing during the final parade scene.
969;Eastwood does a nice job of directing but there were a few too many slow crane shots and mood moments that seemed out of place.
970;the best moments were the intimate dialog scenes, especially Penn and Robbins and the stylish sweeping shots from overhead or flying low over the river seemed to clash with the interior shots.
971;enjoyable enough but not satisfying.
972;The story is a tough one to put on screen as fully detailed as the book, but Eastwood still has a future.
973;I'll see this movie again.
974;guard while SLOWLY (and that's calculated as well) delivering its emotional payloads.
975;Nothing in this gorgeous film is an accident, including Laura Linney's chilling transformation into Lady MacBeth
976;But god, what a trick . . .
977;For those who have read the book, and thus know the outcome of the mystery, the story's tragic dimensions are even more striking.
978;But those who watch it knowing nothing, it is a gripping, powerful who.
979;I have to give Helgeland and Eastwood tremendous credit for finding graceful ways to deposit the bits and pieces of exposition that are essential to fully appreciating the story.
980;as I write, Sean Penn was just awarded the Oscar for best actor.
981;As good as he's been in films ranging from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, to Dead Man Walking, this movie is his personal best.
982;Tim Robbins, another winner, is perhaps even slightly better, and more surprising.
983;the ultimate star of this movie, however, is the great Clint Eastwood.
984;This movie is a classic, and an unforgettable experience.
985;very good cast of actors, the acting was very very good.
986;Sean Penn did a great job.
987;Very good story with a great ending.
988;This film is the usual Dennis Lehane crime procedural set in Boston, but with some stellar performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.
989;Not even worth many words.
990;However the movie is incredible in my opinion, Sean Penn delivers one of the best performances of his career and yet is STILL blown away in my humble opinion by Tim Robbins.
991;A very powerful film that will have you talking about it for several days later.
992;Many times I can gauge a dramatic movie on my first impression after seeing it.
993;Most of the time I love movies I have to think about.
994;Most did a formidable job.
995;This film is a faithful and fantastic adaptation of Dennis Lehane's powerful novel.
996;Fantastic performances by all of the actors, and a well written script.
997;MYSTIC RIVER may win Clint Eastwood an Oscar for Best Director, but I'd be surprised if the film wins Best Picture because it concludes with too many loose ends and thus fails as a conventional morality play.
998;Jimmy goads the other two into defacing a freshly.
999;Dave (Tim Robbins), a handyman, is married with one son.
1000;late one night, Dave arrives home with a mangled hand and a superficial slash across his stomach.
1001;prisoners piece (Penn, Robbins, and Bacon) give three noteworthy performances.
1002;Those of Penn and Robbins are particularly excellent, and surely merit Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nominations respectively.
1003;i found this film mildly gripping until the last act, and then I was sickened.
1004;Perhaps I was more sympathetic to Tim Robbins' character's sincere efforts to control his urges than I was to Sean Penn's manic rages, but one need not be conflicted to sense that something is morally and ethically amiss.
1005;Devine and Marcus wave and smile at each other, as if justice was served.
1006;Adapted from Dennis Lehane's critically acclaimed novel, Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is a masterful achievement.
1007;The film is superbly crafted by screenwriter Brian Helgeland and may turn out to be Clint Eastwood's crowning masterpiece as a director.
1008;It also helps that Eastwood has assembled one of the finest ensemble casts in years to act out this deep, gripping story.
1009;sean Penn gives a furious, impressive performance here, for which he won the Oscar for Best Actor.
1010;His Jimmy Markham is toughened by the prison time he has done, but will do anything to protect his wife and children.
1011;Although there are moments when Penn seems to be showing off how good of an actor he is and going slightly overboard, there is an intensity in his characterization that is mesmerizing.
1012;The scenes where Jimmy mourns his murdered daughter are some of the most moving depictions of grief I have ever seen on film.
1013;as the severely disturbed Dave Boyle, Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career.
1014;Dave is haunted by what happened to him as a child, and he can do nothing to escape his memories of it.
1015;Robbins is astounding to watch, his body sagging with the weight of a lifetime, his eyes filled with fear and shame.
1016;It's no wonder that Robbins won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
1017;Marcia Gay Harden also turns in solid work as Dave's troubled wife Celeste, who thinks her husband might be a killer.
1018;It could have been a thankless role, but Harden makes it count.
1019;But with admirable subtlety, Bacon skillfully etches a portrait of a man whose non.
1020;As his partner, Laurence Fishburne provides the solid support needed to make the murder investigation plot work.
1021;mention must also be made of Laura Linney's superb performance.
1022;Then she has an astonishing scene at the end of the film, a simple dialogue with her husband where she reveals the Lady Macbeth.
1023;It is a compliment to Laura Linney's extreme talent as an actress that she almost steals the movie with about ten minutes of screen time.
1024;Mystic River is a dark, brooding, masterpiece of a film.
1025;The direction, acting, and writing are all first rate.
1026;It is an instant classic.
1027;I thought that was the dumbest thing on earth.
1028;3 stars because of the great acting by Robins.
1029;It has tremendously strong actors, including the supporting roles.
1030;The story line is good, and the pace of the movie is just right.
1031;Credit to Clint Eastwood for his efforts behind the camera.
1032;He lives IT and then he shoots IT.
1033;but intellectual reaching in this movie is fine and pardoned.
1034;The director's secrets are always locked up in a female character.
1035;For instance, watching Dave's wife was like viewing a merky Chrystal Ball with the answers swimming around in her gaze.
1036;Also, when the kids called 911 and said, he wants to know her name, also is a diversion.
1037;What it does have is amazingly good performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins as the two leading characters.
1038;It has very good performances from Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney.
1039;The Dennis Lehane story is well adapted to the screen and Clint Eastwood does a fine job of building suspense to the heart rending ending.
1040;Even if you have read the book (as I had) you have to see the fine acting of the lead characters.
1041;The greatest tragedy in Mystic River is that it was made at all.
1042;Little too much violence for me (not by today standards sadly), otherwise good movie, liked it!
1043;A very good who done it movie with an ending that leaves you suspended.
1044;I had seen the movie before but enjoyed it enough to view it again.
1045;Great acting, good story line, suspenseful.
1046;Sean Penn and Tim Robbins deserved the win.
1047;Kevin Bacon was really good even he didn't win anything.
1048;This movie is a classic in its own right.
1049;Mystic River is a very powerful movie with powerhouse performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.
1050;Definately the best Clint Eastwood movie ever made.
1051;You got alot here raw emotion from a very good cast, The direction is superb too because when you watch the movie it will force you to make a judgement about a certain charector and what you may believe he is capable of.
1052;It will drive you into coming to the conclusion that you may believe is rational.
1053;It brings new meaning to, cooler heads prevail.
1054;I can always count on Clint Eastwood to make a good movie.
1055;Mystic River is just the right amount of drama.
1056;It is one of my must own movies because it has such a great mysterious plot which kept me guessing.
1057;All of the actors including Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon gave great performances.
1058;The music suits the movie well.
1059;I think it was sufficient and well made.
1060;The idea is to make do with what has happened since you can't take back what has been said or done.
1061;etc. this movie gives you something to think about and has a satisfying plot, 5 stars .
1062;Enjoyed movie, very good performance by cast, cast were well chosen for there rolls and performed them well, I watch this movie again
1063;As they are writing their names in some fresh cement, a man approaches them angrily, claiming to be a policeman.
1064;Each of these three actors is brilliant in his part and they are well.
1065;directed and it deserves all of the accolades it has received.
1066;I watched it because I enjoy movies in that era (60's).
1067;It was a little slow at times, but still it kept me on the edge of my seat.
1068;MOVIE: This was a favorite come the time of the Oscars and really showed some talented actors doing their thing.
1069;There is so much character development that it really shows the audience the true darkness of human nature.
1070;It is one of the greatest crime dramas out there its just that so is Se7en, and so is Life of David Gale.
1071;A great movie that had so much support from the critics that it ended up being loved by everybody.
1072;vIDEO: Very nice transfer from warner that really handles the dark scenes very well.
1073;In the center you have the feature disc, and on the right you have the other two discs overlapping each other in a design that was done with the Pink Panther Film Collection.
1074;Disc 2 has a platter of really movie buff extras.
1075;Sean Penn is incredible in his academy aware winning performance.
1076;Who is the murderer is not the question that prompts the movie forward but it is our inquisitive notion for the character's behavioral process that keeps our mind churning.
1077;Mystic River soars in many levels but with a few minor drawbacks.
1078;The acting is exceptional, the suspense is there, it is Eastwood's best film since Unforgiven, it is a fervent film, it is a low.
1079;i saw this in the theater many months ago, so some of the film's details may be fuzzy.
1080;But the memory of the film's tangle of powerful emotions, as well as its great performances and tragic ending, have remained vivid in my mind.
1081;maybe that is an indication as to what a powerful film this is cumulatively.
1082;scarred Dave Boyle (it is, the way I see it, the story of Dave's personal tragedy above all else), and he comes through with a heartbreaking performance that is fully worthy of the Best Supporting Oscar he won at this past year's ceremony.
1083;In fact, in its overall impact, MYSTIC RIVER was really the best of the five Best Picture Nominees this past year.
1084;Certainly it has more authentic humanity than anything in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy (impressive though they were technically, although really the two are not in contention).
1085;in short, MYSTIC RIVER may not be perfect, but it is still a great and powerful film, one definitely worth seeing at least once.
1086;I love the actors in the movie and have to say its definately some of the best acting therefore I rated it at 3 stars.
1087;Dave is now a cop scrambling to solve the mystery before Jimmy takes it upon himself to resolve the matter his way.
1088;this is a very sad and touching tale of friendship, innocence lost, and betrayal.
1089;The acting, screenplay, and drama are all fantastic.
1090;This is everything you expect from director Clint Eastwood, and it is also Sean Penn's best movie.
1091;This is a shocking and emotional movie that will leave you stunned at the conclusion.
1092;It's a must see for any movie lover.
1093;Eastwood always manages to get some good performances out of his actors.
1094;He presents them with a set totally relaxed, and yet super efficient, so that several scenes.
1095;Sean Penn gives his best performance in MYSTIC RIVER, and Tom Robbins is also unforgettable.
1096;Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are great in this murder mystery!
1097;Laurence Fishburne and Laura Linney are great supporting actors too, very good movie
1098;This is a very captivating story.
1099;I loved this movie and I have watched it on more than one occasion.
1100;written story with well developed characters, several subplots, and an intriguing theme.
1101;The cinematography is well balanced with terrific performances by the cast (including Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne and many others), which displays a realistic atmosphere.
1102;This attribution of personal characteristics pulls the audience into an unwanted, yet unavoidable direction.
1103;Consequently, Mystic River offers an exceptionally good cinematic experience that will leave the audience pondering for a long time.
1104;Mystic River is a great movie.
1105;Great actors and suspenfull surprised ending.
1106;Not only is this movie a great example of storytelling at its finest, but it is also a finely crafted tale of characters shaped by events, and people affected by those events long after the fact.
1107;rourke's and Robbin's performances are simply outstanding.
1108;The direction is tight, skillful in building suspense and never gives in to the obvious methods of imagery or symbolism.
1109;Those cyes are subtle and assume the audience is intelligent and observant.
1110;It is one that I would rather watch once every two or three years, just to get the full effect and impact of the experience.
1111;I really liked this movie, I wanted to see it when it came out to the shows at 1st and wasn't able, so glad it was offered on amazon.
1112;Sean Penn's performance was masterful in this complex story of how chance affects the outcome of our lives.
1113;This movie is well worth watching.
1114;The characters are perfectly chosen and do an excellent job.
1115;The film then flashes forward to the same area, but in the present day.
1116;mystic River is a good, old.
1117;There are plenty of plot twists and red herrings to keep the viewer guessing till the last few minutes.
1118;The film is ably directed by the great Clint Eastwood, at the helm of his 24th film.
1119;In this film, like in just about all his films, he doesn't try anything flashy or groundbreaking at the helm but is sensitive and competent and builds and maintains a good pace and tension.
1120;this is primarily a dialogue driven story, with powerful acting from the three leads, supported ably by some great actors including Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney.
1121;Indeed, the performances of Penn and Robbins garnered them the Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively.
1122;In Mystic River, director Clint Eastwood has taken the themes of pain and loss, added superb actors, and a literate script to make a memorable movie.
1123;When Jimmy's daughter is murdered, Sean investigates, Jimmy vows vigilante justice, and Dave is a prime suspect.
1124;the lead actors are outstanding here.
1125;The two men certainly deserved their Oscars.
1126;this is a movie that will pull at your heartstrings while keeping you guessing who the killer is.
1127;There are, thankfully, no graphic scenes of child abuse or the girl's death, yet you will be on the edge of your seat much of the time.
1128;This is an outstanding film.
1129;I have watched this movie a lot of times was very good.
1130;The movie was pretty good.
1131;Good story line and and plot.
1132;If you are looking for a good movie to watch, this is a pretty good choice.
1133;This movie was both heartbreaking and wonderfully written.
1134;I'll begin by saying this film is one of the best I have seen for a long while.
1135;The characters are all very believable and draw you in to the action constantly.
1136;especially from Tim Robbins who truly gives a fantastic performance.
1137;i thoroughly recommend this film.
1138;It is chilling and powerful without being overly graphic.
1139;Sean Penn is intense as Jimmy Markum, whose daughter is murdered in the present day.
1140;the rest of the characters are well.
1141;Although I figured the killer out just before the cops, the movie still held my interest until the end.
1142;The cinemetography is incredible, especially most of the arial shots and the use of shadows during the river scene towards the end.
1143;Laura Linney, playing as Penn's faithful wife, also did a wonderful job.
1144;mystic River also delievered a fresh dose of reality without the usual Hollywood melodramactic approach.
1145;MR also did a brillant job of including unexpected humor throughout the movie to show that even good dramas can have a sense of humor.
1146;If you do not like it on the first run, see it again, trust me.
1147;Lots of characters but you keep up cause they're good about going back and relating each one of them from the past and now.
1148;One of my all time favorites!
1149;The acting and directing doesn't get much better than this, and its no wonder it won Academy Awards!
1150;Mystic River should have won Best Movie.
1151;In my mind it did.
1152;Congratulations Mr. Eastwood and thank you for the well crafted story.
1153;in the middle of the movie Sean Penn, who is brilliant, explains how he got together wth the mother of his now murdered daughter, Katie.
1154;Clint Eastwood does an extraordinary job just following the book.
1155;It is scary and haunting with wounded has beens acting heroic and heroes making awful mistakes.
1156;Everyone knows their part, Laurence Fisburne as Kevin Bacon''s Sergeant is excellent, Tim Robbins as the adult Dave Boyle's superior performance nearly won him a best supporting
1157;the endings remain the same
1158;I would be astonished if after 10 years, this didn't still rank as one of the best movies of the decade.
1159;A great, haunting, disturbing, memorable, critically acclaimed movie.
1160;yet somehow won an Academy Award for this image.
1161;dimensional acting belongs to director Clint Eastwood, a Hollywood insider on scale with Pretty Woman Julie Roberts and California Gov. Arnold Terminator Schwarzenegger.
1162;it's great to be Clint Eastwood, I guess.
1163;One of the elements that makes The Sopranos the best program in television history is its language coaching, especially the on.
1164;It put a smile on Bacon's face after two hours but played no role in the film.
1165;A movie may be well.
1166;acted and worthy of many technical credits, but this plot was depressing, disturbing, and not even remotely entertaining.
1167;In fact, I can get into a heavy drama with the best of them, provided there is some element of hope, resolution, redemption or something that I can walk away feeling good about.
1168;Sean Penn gave a remarkable performance, as impressive as his usually are.
1169;Tim Robbins also did exceptionally well and Kevin Bacon gave an equally gripping performance.
1170;i give the movie a full five stars.
1171;This was a great movie with a solid plot.
1172;The film is good and should have won best film of the year instead of Lord of the Rings 3, which was stuip.
1173;All the acting is great.
1174;provides credible portrayal of hardened ex con that embraces his position as loyal and loving head of the house.
1175;Robbins and Bacon are also outstanding in their respective roles.
1176;Film is both suspenseful and heart wrenching.
1177;The film plays fair with the audience and ultimately it is the characters that captivate us.
1178;But the performances of the entire cast are outstanding and it is easy to believe that these people all grew up in this neighborhood and are indeed feeling the pains that force them to make the life altering decisions they do in the course of this film.
1179;this is also a film that successfully hints at the depth of the novel, no more so when Jimmy's second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney) delivers what is essentially the films benediction and provides a new perspective on the events that have transpired, putting them rather unexpectedly on a larger level.
1180;When I saw this the week it opened .
1181;to a full theatre .
1182;I loved the story line in this movie.
1183;The power that emanted from his performance could be felt.
1184;His portrayal of the grieving Father is one of the best that I have seen.
1185;I also liked the intellectual challenge of the film.
1186;I enjoy watching films that are directed by Clint Eastwood, he must be a true director to get such a performance from an actor of Sean Penn's caliber.
1187;Phenomenal, memorable, solid acting, with an eery feeling the entire film.
1188;Still worth every minute of screen time.
1189;I expected something deeper, some kind of sense of spirituality, of humanity.
1190;It takes more than solid acting to impress me, and the acting is overrated anyway.
1191;See it if you want to give up on life.
1192;I actors and actresses were good.
1193;the story and directing were good.
1194;aside from that, the plot and the setting, are both excellent!
1195;In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.
1196;overall, Mystic River is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.
1197;Terrific development of characters
1198;Great whodunit
1199;I watched this movie because I love all the actors in it.
1200;I was quite surprised when it turned out to be a tear jerked!
1201;I've watched it twice and recommended it to all my friends.
1202;It's a real life story.
1203;Clint Eastwood is a fine director and has a great story, screenplay and actors to work with.
1204;My emotions were stirred by the very real human condition which it depicted.
1205;Even though he survives and grows to adulthood, he will always bear its scars as an adult.
1206;This adult role is played by Tim Robbins and his performance is so outstanding that he didn't even seem to be acting.
1207;And we all can identify with his feelings of rage and helplessness.
1208;He's a good actor and I found myself thinking about his performance during the film.
1209;the supporting actors were excellent too.
1210;the film held my interest throughout, kept me guessing, and kept picking up velocity.
1211;Highly recommended for lovers of serious films.
1212;I always enjoy a who done it movie!
1213;I think it is worth viewing!
1214;Very suspenseful and kept me guessing throughout.
1215;A sign of a very good movie is that you are still thinking about it the next day, it's not just watched then forgotten.
1216;This is a very good one and I would recommend it to others, deep, profound, and moving.
1217;moving forward 25 years the three men are reunited when Jimmy's 19 year old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is found brutally murdered.
1218;while the murder mystery plays well and will hold most audiances to their seats for 138 minutes the real strength of this wonderfully written film is the depth of screenwriter's (Brian Helgeland) characters with their keenly tempoed pursuit for truth and understanding of the two crimes and impact on their lives.
1219;blooded avenger is a real tour.
1220;Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden are wonderful as wives to Jimmy and Dave, providing a contrast in degree of support they provide their husbands.
1221;the film's ending will leave some unhappy or unsatisfied, but for most it should remind us what great directing, writing and acting can provide.
1222;This movie was very suspenseful, tricky, and heartbreaking.
1223;It is a movie worth seeing a few times.
1224;This was a movie I so wanted to see when it released some time ago.
1225;i thought the plot was great and the characters really fit their roles.
1226;It had a sad ending but I would highly recommend it to all adults.
1227;Space Cowboys) has directed for many years and this film is one of the best Who Done It .
1228;I even got mad at myself watching this because I thought I was pretty sharp.
1229;this film is well crafted and very intricate in the story.
1230;sean Penn (I Am Sam, State of Grace, Thin Red Line) give an incredible performance as a father who has a tragedy happen to him and makes choices that affect everyone's life.
1231;He is scary in this film.
1232;tim Robbins give a stellar performance the boy with the past who haunts his future and creates a situation that he can not control.
1233;He is a nut .
1234;and the stunning performance by his wife played by .
1235;laurence Fishburne (The Matrix 1,2 and 3, Event Horizon) gives a great compliment to being Kevin bacons partner.
1236;it is truly a mystery within a mystery.
1237;this puts a new twist on who you think did it.
1238;beautifully photographed and stunning camera work make this a very intriguing mystery.
1239;A riveting storyline that held me to the end.
1240;They all live in a fantasy world where the plot of this movie makes sense and is acceptable.
1241;This movie was completely over the top.
1242;A man just died and we are served to smiles and happy times by all characters involved in an ending coverup.
1243;This is an excellent movie and so was the book.
1244;This is a great movie for any guest at any time.
1245;Mystic River is a dark, powerful tale of lives lost.
1246;As young boys, they played in the streets enjoying carefree time together.
1247;meanwhile, Dave is living in the neighborhood too, with a young son and lovely wife, but carries the dark memories of his childhood constantly on his shoulders.
1248;mystic River is deeply moving and powerful.
1249;Would recommend to anyone that likes drama and also wants to shed a few tears.
1250;Love movies that don't end up the way you expect them to!
1251;Throughout the whole movie i was like What?
1252;The reason i enjoyed this move so much was because it wasn't only about solving a murder, but it was about friendship and fighting battles in your life.
1253;The great acting made you actually feel like you knew the characters.
1254;The one thing I didn't like was that at the end they kind of still had you guessing to exactly what happend, and what is still yet to come.
1255;It has an allstar cast with a strong performance and no weak links.
1256;I highly recommened this film It goes deep into the emotions of the characters, the storyline is deep and will get you deeply into it.
1257;Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne play the strongest roles in this film.
1258;They portray their characters very well and as I said no weak performances.
1259;Enjoy the film I hope you see it, it really is a great movie.
1260;I'm not a Sean Penn fan but enjoyed his acting in his role as a devastated father.
1261;Tim Robbins' acting was moving and I thought he was the best part of the movie.
1262;Kevin Bacon was also very good as the cop investigating the murder.
1263;For a movie to be exceptional, I think the audience has to care about the characters.
1264;Also, if one is looking to see an entertaining movie, stay home.
1265;There is nothing positive or hopeful about this film.
1266;by bravura performances from almost all of its stars.
1267;The best performance comes from Sean Penn, who seems to be channelling a young Robert DeNiro.
1268;Part of it had to do with the manner in which her fleeting appearances were filmed.
1269;overall, Mystic River is an intense, involving movie.
1270;Sean Penn may well receive the Oscar he deserves.
1271;Great cast and solid story line.
1272;Directed by Clint Eastwood which was a surprise by very well done.
1273;I would recommend this film.
1274;I could watch this movie again.
1275;Great actors who did a great job, but what were they thinking?
1276;Very suspenseful with so many twists.
1277;The movie had great actors and their work was done well but the book was just so much better.
1278;Besides the good actors .
1279;Hhad a lot of my favorite actors in it.
1280;I will definitely suggest it to friends.
1281;Clint Eastwood makes the best heartfelt films.
1282;I enjoyed the acting of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.
1283;It was a very good movie.
1284;Oh Kevin bacon was a dream!
1285;The method he is using is masterful and unique, and you probably have to have some sort of film or theatre background to truly appreciate it.
1286;eastwood does the only thing a truly talented and knowledgable director could do with this forceful story .
1287;this style of directing worked well in Unforgiven and it works doubly.
1288;that very minor complaint aside, this is a marvelous film.
1289;Great cast, solid writing, but both the book and the movie had the same problem: at the heart of the story there is nothing.
1290;Now, that has some oomph to it.
1291;I like this film, I do.
1292;ray edition I offer a caveat for those who seek memorable characters and meaning in film
1293;He has done a fine job with several other films as well, but in Mystic River Clint signals a full maturity in his gift as a director.
1294;he began with a stellar cast, and I won't waste anyone's time being the ten millionth person to praise Sean Penn's stunning performance.
1295;A cast that breathes life into this sorrowful tale surrounds him.
1296;screen in a role that is perhaps the most difficult and complex one of the movie, and he seems believable every moment.
1297;Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne make good cop.
1298;there are many virtuoso sequences in the film as two simultaneous events are juxtaposed upon each other.
1299;But it does that with consummate skill, and I admire it for that.
1300;I found this film mildly gripping until the last act, and then I was sickened.
1301;Perhaps I was more sympathetic to Tim Robbins' character's sincere efforts to control his urges than I was to Sean Penn's manic rages, but one need not be conflicted to sense that something is morally and ethically amiss.
1302;Devine and Marcus wave and smile at each other, as if justice was served.
1303;Always looking for a good crime drama, I came across this title at LackLuster Video last weekend.
1304;I know that Clint Eastwood is a highly underrated director.
1305;I'm glad that I finally got to it.
1306;It is the last time he will see her alive.
1307;The next day she is found, murdered.
1308;the main portion of the movie moves across the stories of the individuals involved.
1309;Dave grapples with the demons of his past.
1310;An assembly of talent such as this is rare in today's films.
1311;All accolades he received were well deserved.
1312;Give this one a watch.
1313;Very good movie, but like most if you have read the book, you will notice the movie can only do so much in the time frame.
1314;Mystic River is a cinematic masterpiece.
1315;harden provide superlative performances,while struggling with the South Boston accent, yet in the end that hardly matters as their characters are brought to life.
1316;As a whole, Mystic River is an excellant adaptation of the novel and Eastwood does an excellant job of using the South Boston neighborhood to complement his storytelling.
1317;I had not seen this and knew it had won awards.
1318;Timothy Botttoms was the real star.
1319;Given a choice I would probably choose something with mor happiness involved!
1320;Although I liked the book better, the movie was very well done and held your interest till the very end.
1321;this is a must see!
1322;serendipidous trailer: if you are enjoying this, you will love 'fargo'.
1323;Mystic River is a rich, densely.
1324;Part drama, part psychological thriller, it is one of the finest films of 2003.
1325;It is also an actor's dream.
1326;Containing at least a half dozen excellent roles, it provided Sean Penn a Best Actor Oscar, as well as one for Tim Robbins as Best Supporting Actor.
1327;`Riveting' is a good word to describe the story.
1328;He is found a few days later in a cellar.
1329;He still hangs out with the local thugs.
1330;Dave [Tim Robbins], the one who was kidnapped, lives life as best he can.
1331;Mystic River is possibly Clint Eastwood's crowning achievement in a long and very interesting career.
1332;Unforgiven was Eastwood's finest work.
1333;It had incredible dialogue that explains their legends.
1334;Unforgiven had demensions in their character and had an incredible story.
1335;this is a great film, I wish I could of given it five stars, but it's not original, but this film has great acting.
1336;Eastwood mixes a plotline that explores the complexity of human emotions and human relationships with some outstanding performances by Penn, Robbins, and Bacon.
1337;Perhaps the most potent aspect of the movie is its portrayal of the devastation caused by sexual abuse.
1338;mash and the seeming triumph of the tragic hero .
1339;To my wonderful surprise, watching Mystic River last night, I discovered that Clint Eastwood's gorgeous, mournful drama/mystery is one of them.
1340;There's something about the downsized visuals of the movie combined with the intimacy of home viewing that just makes the movie click even more.
1341;And if you have seen it in theaters, I urge you to give it another viewing, for the ensemble acting of the movie is .
1342;the finest of the year.
1343;harden's body language, and the rigid but broken body and soul of Penn (who now, more than ever, shows that he deserved the Oscar over Bill Murray).
1344;The whole scene where Penn discovers his daughter's body is a masterpiece of timing and camerawork: when it finally hits him, the omnipotent lens pulls back into the heavens, letting Penn's grief echo as Eastwood's score swells.
1345;My favorite shot of the film is a pull.
1346;In fact, throughout the entire film (especially in its explosive final act) there is so much craft in the direction and acting that it's easy to overlook the film's flaws.
1347;I went to the local cinema with high expectations.
1348;& Tim Robbins do the best work of their careers here without a doubt.
1349;For the best(& bizarrely ignored)Sean Penn performance of the year, go straight to the emotional powerhouse.21 GRAMS.
1350;Mystic River has great performances.
1351;It finally won Sean Penn an oscar and got Tim Robbins one which was well deserved.
1352;The performances are good, but the movie can't quite make up for that.
1353;Great acting from Sean Penn in this movie.
1354;It is definitely not the typical hoopla Hollywood usually turns out
1355;It is the kind of movie that you can't say you liked without explaining why, as it is a dark movie without a neatly tied up ending.
1356;As the credits roll, the viewer realizes this film has no happy ending or a resolution and instead it leaves you with questions and outrage.
1357;in addition to a complex and interesting story, this movie also has incredible writing, directing, and acting.
1358;The movie and the story manage to be both emotionally touching and emotionally revolting.
1359;i highly recommend this movie.
1360;This is perhaps one of the best films of all time.
1361;It messes with your head, gets you thinking, and you come out a better person on the other side.
1362;Themes like family, trust, believing and supporting the people you love, being honest, and learning to grown past yourself are definitely centric.
1363;I recommend it if you are connected to yourself.
1364;the acting, the writing, the past/present overlays, the storyline, the intrigue.
1365;practically a perfect film, on par with The Secrets in Their Eyes.
1366;When you thought you knew who the killer was something else popped up.
1367;Good thing his wife and daughter showed up.
1368;dave's trauma was powerfully moving .
1369;this was a combination of some very powerful acting of both the men and women involved.
1370;it must be viewed with sensitivity and an open mind to be able to catch all of the nuances of tragedy involved.
1371;Powerful, admirable filmmaking from Eastwood and Co. in this dark and brooding drama starring Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.
1372;This is now one of my new favorite films.
1373;I loved their scenes together.
1374;The teens/kids (i. e. Brendan) were terrific and turned in stunning performances.
1375;In their childhood, Jimmy Markham, Dave Boyle and Sean Divine shared one lifechanging event.
1376;They ordered Dave Boyle into their car and kept him in a hidden room in the woods while they engaged in sexual activities.
1377;sean Divine is now a police officer and he is one of the lead investigators.
1378;Markham is friends with a number of men who do their own inquiry.
1379;sean Penn won the Oscar for best actor.
1380;tim Robbins won the Oscar for best supporting actornominations went to Marica Gay Harden for best supporting actress, Clint Eastweed for his direction and to the movie for best movie.
1381;i enjoyed the movie and felt I was experiencing the great writing from Denis Lehane one more time.
1382;I don't like Sean Penn and Tim Robbins because of there politics but they are good actors and a this is a good movie.
1383;Brian Helgeland is to be commended for his faithful adaptation of Dennis Lehane's brilliant book.
1384;Clint Eastwood is to be commended for his superb direction, getting remarkable performances from his outstanding cast.
1385;I found it to be a moving, disturbing film, one that would have won more Oscars had it not been up against the Lord of the Rings Return of the King.
1386;Penn devastates with his performance and deserved his Oscar, hands down.
1387;tim Robbins as Dave is likewise brilliant and he too deserved his supporting Oscar.
1388;His scene with his wife in discussing vampirism and how he likens it to his life is chilling.
1389;kevin Bacon, one of our most underappreciated actors, shines in his role as Sean, the third of the boyhood friends, who as a homicide detective has to confront old pains in finding out who killed Penn's daughter.
1390;laura Linney, one of our finest actresses, shines in the role of Annabeth, Jimmy's supportive and ambitious wife.
1391;Her own agenda and ambition are coldly captured, and Linney is superb in conveying that.
1392;also excellent in smaller roles are Thomas Guiry as Brandon, the boyfriend of Katie, who was going to run off with her to Las Vegas, and Laurence Fishburne as Bacon's cynical hardboiled partner.
1393;the entire cast is perfect, and the movie packs an emotional wallop rarely captured in today's youth.
1394;mYSTIC RIVER is a cinematic experience of immeasurable power, and does justice to a most exceptional novel.
1395;Clint Eastwood has directed a masterpiece which is most likely his best work ever.
1396;The mind frame, the course of action, and the need of closure all play a very important role in this tension.
1397;It's one of those rare films where you could've watched it unfold forever.
1398;Clint Eastwood has done a marvelous job of directing this masterpiece of human tragedy and loss.
1399;Kevin Bacon is terrific and comes off more than just a simple cop.
1400;Laurence Fishburne was a complete joy to watch, as well.
1401;What it all comes down to is that the complete cast is terrific.
1402;Mystic River is an unforgettable, heart.
1403;breaking and overwhelming film that really can show you how fantastic a movie can be if you have the characters and the emotion.
1404;Not everyone will enjoy it, as it isn't action.
1405;packed, but for those who love character development are in for a real treat.
1406;If you haven't seen it yet, I really recommend checking it out.
1407;It's definitely one of the better movies to come out of 2003.
1408;Would watch again and have told friends to watch.
1409;Mystic River, directed by Clint Eastwood, is a powerful drama set in Boston.
1410;Their lives and relationships with each other are impacted when a killing occurs.
1411;a shocking prologue sequence establishes the tone for a dark psychological crime story with plenty of twists and intriguing clues.
1412;The ensemble is truly a dream cast, and also features Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney as the wives of Robbins' and Penn's characters, and Laurence Fishburne as the partner to Bacon's police detective.
1413;Every one of these fine artists is at the top of his or her form
1414;weary gravitas to his character, and has strong chemistry with the compelling Fishburne.
1415;And Penn is superb in his rich, multifaceted role.
1416;the film has a raw, gritty feel.
1417;The setting is integral to the story
1418;Still, it's a powerful tale of death, guilt, secrecy, and the quest for justice.
1419;worth performance, has to settle for a Golden Globe.
1420;the only real mystery abour Mystic River is how is won ANY awards.
1421;This movie was a dramatic, suspenseful, and had a great twist at the end.
1422;Sean Penn was great in this movie!
1423;It was a good film, with the acting saving it and though I never read the book, I heard it was like the book.
1424;Sean Penn deserved the Oscar but why this film got a Best Picture Nom.
1425;Meanwhile, Eastwood's direction is lovingly detailed, Helgeland's dialogue is spot.
1426;on, and the ensemble cast is nothing short of brilliant.
1427;But the bleak honesty of its moral vision and the brilliance of its craft compel our admiration and respect.
1428;Dave Boyle, Jimmy Markum, and Sean Devine were pals when they were boys.
1429;One day Dave got into a stranger's car and didn't return for four days, and that event would prove to change the course of his life from that point onward.
1430;Dave (Tim Robbins) is married and has a son himself.
1431;And the past proves not to be so distant after all.
1432;The cast is all very talented, and the performances are competent, but the characters are overwrought to say the least.
1433;The most impressive performances come from Marcia Gay Harden as Dave's wife Celeste and Laura Linney as Jimmy's wife Annabeth.
1434;Annabeth's startling speech and Celeste's behavior in the last minutes of the film do more than anything else to bring home the story's major ideas.
1435;So, in spite of this talented cast, I have to say that the film has the most success with its murder mystery.
1436;The murder is mysterious
1437;But in the film, the mystery serves as a vehicle for gritty melodrama.
1438;And the vehicle proves better than its objective.
1439;Eastwood did a good job, but the film isn't earth.
1440;Mystic River has a lot to recommend it: A talented cast, a good mystery, excellent supporting performances.
1441;Still, the film is very worth seeing.
1442;i thought the acting was superb and the ending was very unexpected for me.
1443;I always love Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon in any movie they do.
1444;Tim Robbins did an exceptional job playing Dave.
1445;The main suspect in the murder is Jimmy and Shawn's friend Dave, because he came home the night of the murder covered in blood spinning a half baked story about being attacked by mugger.
1446;in my opinion, Mystic River is the best film of 2003.
1447;Clint Eastwood shows once again that he is an amazing director.
1448;Mystic River is definately his best film since Unforgiven.
1449;The reason Mystic River is so great, is because the mystery of the killer is extremely well done.
1450;Tim Robbins did an excellent job as Dave and deserved his academy award for best supporting actor.
1451;When the killer is finally revealed, it will shock you.
1452;Sean Penn gave one of the best performances I have seen in a while.

1454;Penn's performance was filled with emotion and intensity.
1455;The entire cast is phenomenal, and the ending is extremely satisfying.

1457;notch cast and directed superbly.
1458;Tim Robbins gives a terrific performance as the relatively dull.
1459;worth seeing again and again.
1460;three friends from urban Boston (a dynamic acting trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon) share a history.
1461;Surprisingly, there is a lot of ground to cover, detailing Jimmys' chekered past as well as Dave dealing with his own wicked experience as a boy.
1462;Screenwriter Brian Helgeland (L. a. confidential) does so with a clarity and even.
1463;eastwoods' supporting cast is equally stellar as the three leads.
1464;Marcia Gay Harden is haunting as Dave's wife, exuding subtle terror and fear that preludes the film's tragic two.
1465;The one real surprise of the film is Laurence Fishburne.
1466;advised Matrix sequels, here he is a sly, humorous partner for Bacon, as well as being a great foil for the star in the scenes they share.
1467;His style, though workmanlike, is masterful.
1468;He knows how to use the actors at his disposal and when he is at his best, he knows how to make a story deeply emotionally resonant, especially here with Helgeland's shrewd script.
1469;This is a great story showing how boys grew up and how a tragedy has brought them all back together.
1470;It shows us where certain people distrust and why and it show us why other love just because.

1472;like special effects and camera angles, Eastwood returns us to the essence of any great film: a good screenplay, remarkable perfromances, and direction that doesn't interfere with the story.2.)
1473;they have to be human, and this film delivers.
1474;Eastwood had the courage to do it himself, and it's refreshingly free of pretense.
1475;This is one you can talk about and interpret.
1476;complete enough to pose the darkest questions, and wise enough to let each viewer search for the answers.
1477;One of the best movies ever made!
1478;And this is due to not only great Direction, but because so many incredible actors were willing to come together in the same movie!
1479;This was one of my favorite films of 2003.
1480;Without a doubt MYSTIC RIVER's biggest highlight is the outstanding performances.
1481;Sean Penn won the Oscar for best actor in a leading role.
1482;Tim Robbins won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role.
1483;Her facial expressions alone made for a brilliant performance.
1484;The movie at its core is really a dramatic who.
1485;Credit must also be given to Clint Eastwood for his keen direction and perfect balance of so many complex characters.
1486;I'm glad I did, I thought it was a very good film.
1487;I was waiting with great anticipation to see this film.
1488;One critic even said it was the best film in 30 years.
1489;The added twists that didn't work and were so easy to spot coming.
1490;This film received generally strong reviews and the actors in it have done well over the course of their careers.
1491;The movie flowed well and the acting was very good.
1492;The ending, while pretty ambiguous and potentially thought provoking was a little bit of a let down, at least in my opinion.
1493;overall this film is worth watching but dont expect to see some type of a masterpiece.
1494;Great actors, Great plot, Great movie.
1495;There are many twists in the movie and it made for an enjoyable experience.
1496;This movie was well done.
1497;I won't give too much away
1498;This movie was very good in my opinion.
1499;Daughter and I decided to start watching it last night around midnight, thinking we would watch the first 30 mins or so and finish it the next day, well that was not an option after it started playing.
1500;The movie was full of suspense and took an awesome turn in the end.
1501;We both enjoyed it to it's fullest.
1502;I would recommend this movie to everyone.
1503;The strength in this movie lies in the acting.
1504;back with In America, and it did measure up to a greatest top ten list movie deserving of five stars.
1505;Sean Penn's acting is gritty and the emotional seething and need for vengeance weigh upon his character heavy.
1506;Hard to discuss without giving it away, but here's one example of what a beautiful movie this is.
1507;She just calls, and listens.
1508;At the end of the movie, he's figured out everything, and finally, he knows what to say to her, and she speaks.
1509;It's beautiful, haunting symbolism, and about 1% of the wonderful things this movie has to offer.
1510;Mystic River is one of the best movies I have seen, and Sean Penn is an outstanding actor, hope he wins the oscar for his acting.
1511;Amazing movie amazing directing and couldn't have chosen better actors or actress simply amazing is the only words that come to mind
1512;it is all very well to point to the hope and promise of shawshank redemption.
1513;but such happens in very rare circumstances to very rare people .
1514;the hard truth is most normal people wilt under such traumatic experiences.
1515;but he has to go on because there are so many who are dependent on him, including the families of his victims.
1516;marks the entry of clint eastwood as a director capable of handling such serious subjects with depth and subtlety.
1517;Everything about the film, from the performances from the entire cast, to Clint Eastwood's super slick direction, is flawless.
1518;Eastwood's moody score and Oscar winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland keep the film twisting, the only problem being Helgeland's script doesn't go as in depth as Dennis Lehane's novel, but he did a more than commendable job nonetheless.
1519;That aside though, this is still a fabulous film, and more than worth seeing.
1520;About 20 minutes before this film ended, I was sure that I was going to put this film on my favorite films of all time list.
1521;The last part that makes you feel satisfied.
1522;The acting was superb, the drama was tense, the script was good, and Clint Eastwood did a superb job of directing.
1523;But, the end is the most important part of the story.
1524;:D it's kind of like entertainment sometimes.
1525;I guess the myth is true: Clint Eastwood makes 1 spectacular film in every 5 he directs (the last being UNFORGIVEN).
1526;Mystic River is a powerful story about deception, trust and guilt.
1527;Sean (Bacon) is a full.
1528;Mystic River is a scintillating film that reassures the viewer to feel certain, and suddenly wallops this secure belief with startling revelations.
1529;And though it may not quite be the masterpiece that the early buzz suggests, it certainly makes the most of the tremendous talents at its disposal.
1530;A mournful meditation on revenge and guilt, Mystic River is perhaps Eastwood's most mature and moving examination yet of what has always been his great subject: the peculiarly American juxtaposition of vigilante violence and official justice.
1531;one moment that pulls three childhood friends apart and another, 30 years later, that brings them back together.
1532;And Sean (Bacon) is now a Boston homicide detective, an outsider in the old neighborhood, working his beat with an astute African.
1533;Jimmy and Dave are still friends .
1534;killer masterpiece 'M', which would only be a beginning to the debt Mystic River owes to Lang's artful police procedurals.)
1535;As Sean and Whitey investigate the case, dual clues point strongly to two suspects: Dave, one of the last people to see Katie alive, and a neighborhood boy whom she had been dating.
1536;by acclimation, Mystic River is Clint Eastwood's finest film since 1992's Oscar.
1537;winner Unforgiven, and you'll find no argument here.
1538;fashioned film, it's so stately, so measured, and so elegant that it acts as a formal rebuke to most other contemporary studio takes on this kind of material.
1539;Mystic River is a mystery spiked with deep emotion and considerable gravitas.
1540;It has a tremendous feel for its location, for this almost tribal old.
1541;It's marked by a tight vocabulary of formal elements .
1542;sure crosscutting and sweeping pans over the film's title waterway.
1543;And this matches the film's series of actorly one.
1544;as one might expect, Mystic River is as much an actor's film as it is a director's.
1545;Its performances are uniformly excellent, with Sean Penn's and Tim Robbins' showy turns perhaps bested by Marcia Gay Harden, whose doting but doubtful wife is perhaps the film's most tragic figure.
1546;His insistence on keeping that promise is the source of Eastwood's most effective critique yet of American vigilante justice.
1547;It looks welcoming and friendly, but for one character it's a moment of horror and loss that brings Mystic River full circle.
1548;In conclusion, a powerful cast and superb direction by Clint Eastwood makes this story of violence and justice an unforgettable one.
1549;Great film Clint does it again .
1550;Surprising shocking suspenseful intense .
1551;Heart stopping Emmy Rossom is great .
1552;great actors, sad story, could be true.
1553;The most upsetting aspect of all this was that they buried the greatest sufferer, the VICTIM!
1554;When I finally watched this movie on HBO, I was extremely impressed.
1555;A great story and an excellent cast.
1556;Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are very deserving of their Oscars for Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor.
1557;This movie takes you on an emotional journey, and challenges your moral instincts.
1558;It is definitely a must see!
1559;Mystic River was one of the best dramatic, suspense thrillers that I've seen in a long time.
1560;I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end of the movie.
1561;This is a well polished who dun it movie.
1562;The acting is decent, and the mood is consistent.
1563;There is nothing that is exciting and new when you watch this movie.
1564;Also, it is very easy to predict the ending.
1565;Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are brilliant!
1566;This would have been fine and dandy had a great director and even greater actors (sorry Kevin you do not qualify although I loved you in Footloose, and Quicksilver) not been in play.
1567;Although critics praise the film as a complex exploration into the human psyche one never really gets that impression from the film.
1568;If this is the best Clint Eastwood can do, perhaps he should have been a comedian.
1569;He could do a stand.
1570;headed, competent, honest, and dedicated FBI agent who doesn't jump to wild conclusions and who tells his partner with believable conviction that he will go where the evidence leads.
1571;roger Ebert says there was great suspense.
1572;Don't get me wrong, the cinematography was outstanding and the actors all turned out bravura performances.
1573;His wife Celeste, Marcia Harden, believes that Dave may have murdered Jimmy's girl.
1574;I would watch this movie again, it held my attention through out.
1575;Watch it your self to find out and enjoy the movie.
1576;This ensemble cast is one of the best ever put together and the heart wrenching storyline is edge of your seat entertainment at his best.
1577;The movie pulled me in just like the book, and Sean Penn's acting was very good.
1578;The story line initially has you drawing conclusions but then throws an unexpected curve at just the right moment.
1579;One of the few movies that is as good as the book.
1580;Clint Eastwood did an excellent job bringing this story to life.
1581;It was suspenseful and kept my interest.
1582;This is high drama, a deep character study.
1583;And this is one helluva superior movie.
1584;That opening scene doesn't take long, but it's riveting with menace and seems to last forever.
1585;Jimmy, the brash one as a kid, is still brash.
1586;And somebody's got to pay.
1587;the directing by Clint Eastwood is superb
1588;The acting is beyond superb
1589;In this respect, the movie belongs to Sean Penn, an actor who's kept getting better and better and better over the years till now: and now, he's perfect.
1590;class Boston neighborhood, is realistic.
1591;still, five solid stars and at least one Oscar nomination, for sure.
1592;gritty and full of nuances.
1593;I read the book first and the movie is very close.
1594;This is one of the best American movies of the year, crisply well.
1595;What results is also Eastwood's best direction since 'Unforgiven' and arguably the best, most mature work of his career.
1596;'Mystic River' merits serious awards attention for Eastwood's artfully understated direction, and come nominations time, Robbins, Penn and Harden belong among the front.
1597;'Mystic River' is the rare American movie that aspires to the full weight and darkness of tragedy.
1598;MYSTIC RIVER is an excellent movie which deserved the ton of praise it received at the time it was released in 2003.
1599;good film but it is certainly unforgettable.
1600;This sweeping tale is the stuff of great film making.
1601;Eastwoods masterful direction and a cast of some of the most prolifc actors we know have created a film that virtually ignites the screen.
1602;It owns itself and stands in the light of both impeccable story telling and brilliance.
1603;I highly recommend it, worth watching, It is a suspense thriller especially at the end and won't waste your time.
1604;Very well written and the acting was outstanding.
1605;Easy to see why it won so many awards.
1606;It was intriguing and suspenseful.
1607;It kept you on your toes.
1608;I give it 4 stars!
1609;stay away from this movie.
1610;special note must be paid to Sean Penn's embarassing facial grimaces throughout this motion picture!
1611;He never draws you in at all which makes you not really care that his daughter dies.
1612;It added absolutely nothing other than being a sort of comic relief to the rest of what is going on.
1613;the movie keeps chugging along!
1614;I would recommend watching this movie only if your life was at stake.
1615;Two of the best actors in the world today.
1616;He wants to know her name the boy tells someone .
1617;or am I picky here?Anyway :Overall this movie is very, very well done .
1618;and that behind a very tense and gripping story.
1619;I liked the movie and felt kind of sad that for no reason the friend was killed before the investigations were complete and in haste they bumped of a friend and an innocent man.
1620;I say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, the movie kept me on the edge of my seat and the acting was phenominal.
1621;Although it is very tragic and sad, I still liked it and I think this is the best movie I have ever seen.
1622;This is a very good movie with realistic turns of events that make the viewers believe it could happen to them.
1623;Good acting and good delivery.
1624;This is a movie that explores the lives of three men deeply (in degrees) affected by a savage event of their youth.
1625;The development of the numerous essential characters in the story is outstanding yet it is done so well that the action never seems to slow down.
1626;The acting is superb with special kudos to Sean Penn who seemed to reach new heights in his already impressive career.
1627;I know that he has directed before and won the Academy Award for The Unforgiven .
1628;This is a complex story told in a kaleidescope of imagery.
1629;A man with considerable power gets his buddies together to seek revenge on a man who must have had something to do with a heinous crime.
1630;You know a film succeeds when you don't want to get up and go to the head.
1631;Penn wins the Academy Award for his role as this disturbed man with a motive to kill.
1632;Tim Robbins plays a disturbed man under soft skin, and he wins an Oscar.
1633;Kevin Bacon returns to his old neighborhood.
1634;The mystery was too clever, still, a good one, tense.
1635;Whether you're a fan of Sean Penn or not, Clint Eastwood directed a movie that's a must see.
1636;The performance that Penn gives is amazing.
1637;It was a little to real for my liking but in the end the message was a good.
1638;But this movie is amazing!
1639;On the edge of your seat at times, crying others!
1640;The average viewer probably jumps to the same conclusion, and, thankfully, there is a pretty big twist in the last half hour or so.
1641;I will say that Sean Penn was cast perfectly.
1642;all the characters were played very well in this very dramatic, thought provoking movie.
1643;Better cast, better plot, better version of a similar story.
1644;Mystic River puts you right in the middle of 3 children's urban Boston life long ago.
1645;Years later, the children are now adults, and are for the most part living their separate lives.
1646;Clint Eastwood did a great job directing (Oscar nominated).
1647;Tim Robbins is wonderful as the moody, mysterious, and borderline.
1648;It was a romance with strong family ties within.
1649;But I guess that Is what made it a great drama.
1650;Great story, great actors, great direction, great music, great art direction, very good editing and all around great movie.
1651;Having spent many a day in Boston in my late teens and early 20s I can say that it certainly felt like I was there again.
1652;The casting, acting and filming in this movie are fantastic.
1653;Clint Eastwood's Directing is superb and is credited with the music in the film.
1654;This is Drama and intrigue at its best.
1655;one of our most favorite movies
1656;While Marcia Gay Harden seems to overact in places, and Sean Penn's powerful acting can sometimes feel overwhelming, the outstanding ensemble holds up its end of the bargain.
1657;What makes the movie work, though, is a clever screenplay that forces the viewer to again and again reconsider the motives of the characters.
1658;robbins is outstanding
1659;Bacon and Fishburne make a strong team, particularly in a scene with Robbins that offers a brief bit of comic relief to the deadly serious proceedings.
1660;this is a great film, well worth seeing.
1661;A passionate yet disturbing film that captures your attention from the start to the end.
1662;The actors in this film are awesome.
1663;The plot was great and the acting was superb especially Sean Penn.
1664;I would definitely recommend it for watching.
1665;alhthough this film is worth watching for its strengths, I find it fundamentally flawed in terms of both its credibility and dramatic power.
1666;the story is laid out methodically, without plodding, and the acting is superb, even if Mr. Fishburne is criminally under.
1667;It is a good movie with good actors.
1668;This is a great flick, with a stellar cast.
1669;The cast hit their parts perfectly without overdoing it.
1670;I am a big fan of Sean Penn and this role fit him to a tee.
1671;and he certainly cant direct at all.
1672;what a pleasure he is to work for.
1673;and a perfectly good story (tho better suited to one of those numerous tv shows about murder amongst the huddled inner city masses and the heroes who solve these crimes.)
1674;with a director directing .
1675;and both these movies are winning awards !!!!
1676;Some of the best male performers today.
1677;i don't want to go through the plot, like so many have, but this film was extremely effective.
1678;Mainly because of the strong script, and unbelievably amazing actors to create this heartbreaking story.
1679;This film was amazing for the simple fact of the strong character analysis.
1680;A strong beginning, a steady and suspensely middle, and a powerful ending.
1681;This is emphasized in the scenes when Bacon's character told his partner that Dave wasn't sexually assaulted, and also when Dave tells his wife the name's of the kidnappers and she doesn't know what he's talking about.
1682;(Also to answer the question why did Dave get into the car with the brothers.
1683;Now he is a family man who loves his children more than anything in the world.
1684;She wanted him to continue to be the King of the streets to love and protect them at all cost.
1685;The ending almost seemed that now that Dave, the hurtful part of their life, was gone they were all able to move on with their lives and forget about the past that had been weighing them down all these years.
1686;Most people will think otherwise, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
1687;But never the less, this is a film that should be seen and experienced first hand, if not for the text, for the amazing performances, including the amazingly subtle Marica Gay Harden as Dave's tormented wife.
1688;This is in my opinion the apex of Clint Eastwood's career as a director.
1689;In some, it becomes more obvious, as in UNFORGIVEN and TIGHTROPE, but usually the characters he plays misleadingly gives the films more moral clarity than exists.
1690;Each one of them brings a level of believability and pathos to his or her character, and while Penn is getting well deserved attention for his performance, I believe Robbins does just as well in his tormented, disturbed character.
1691;It certainly isn't a whodunit, but it is very definitely about the mysteries of the human psyche, of the monsters that we sometimes become because of the horrors that afflict us.
1692;So too, Dave's getting into the car and Jimmy and Sean's not getting into the care created the possibilities that unfolded in the course of this film.
1693;unlike some of the reviewers who have complained about the ending, I think it is the ending that makes this film the minor masterpiece that it is.
1694;Without giving away any plot, I will just hint that that scene provides the key with which to understand everything touching the end of the film.
1695;this is a powerful and impressive film, and will represent one of the highpoints of the careers in all the principals involved.
1696;My own is that it is among Eastwood's greatest achievements as a director.
1697;The acting and cinematography are also outstanding.
1698;This is an intense film, with both menace and rage never far below the surface of mutually endured civility.
1699;Through brilliant editing, he also allows the plot to develop at what seems to me to be a natural pace.
1700;Most of the tension in the film develops after the murder of Katie Markum and builds to that revelation.
1701;That said, I think this is a great film in all other respects and look forward to seeing again.
1702;Great exciting movie Penn was awesome, Kevin Bacon as the detective was also very convincing.
1703;One thing must be kept in mind: making a screen adaptation from a best.
1704;And it is to their credit that this film is so engrossing, so absorbing without being overbearing.
1705;With a cast like this, let them run with their roles.
1706;like performance was something to behold!)
1707;The From Page to Screen feature speaks a little to what I mentioned in the first paragraph about adaptations, and making the words come to visual life that will satisfy the audience.
1708;This set is worth having in your collection.
1709;mystic river is a good movie, not a great one.
1710;It has a great story and great characters .
1711;with a good screenplay by Brian Helgeland, based on Dennis Lehane's book.
1712;The directing is solid, while not really bringing anything special to the film, yet pacing it prefectly in building the tension around the murder.
1713;what is outstanding about this film is the acting.
1714;the rest of the cast give solid performances in somewhat limited characters, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne as the cops asigned to the case, and Laura Linney as Penn's second wife.
1715;who the real killer is comes as a big surprise to everyone.
1716;Lovers of great acting had best not pass up Mystic River, Clint Eastwood's powerful, award.
1717;laden adaptation of Dennis Lehane's best.
1718;Bacon is Sean Divine, a homicide detective assigned to the case, and Robbins is Dave Boyle, a sporadically employed man who may be a prime suspect in the murder.
1719;Dave still lives with the trauma of that earlier soul.
1720;the Brian Helgeland screenplay makes the pain that each of these men experiences vivid and palpable.
1721;Laura Linney, as Jimmy's second wife, has a key Lady Macbeth moment late in the film that might have been effective had we been more fully prepared for it and had her character been more thoroughly developed throughout the course of the film.
1722;still, these are minor quibbles when it comes to a movie as finely acted and directed as this one is.
1723;Robbins beautifully underplays the role of a man scarred forever by what happened to him in his youth, now endeavoring to function as an adult when he was robbed of any semblance of a childhood.
1724;Bacon is excellent as the man who attempts to put all the pieces together, not only of the case but of the shattered lives he and his two buddies have been living all these years, and Marcia Gay Harden is outstanding as Dave's loving wife who struggles with what is perhaps the greatest moral dilemma faced by any character in the movie.
1725;as director, Eastwood allows his superb cast ample time to develop their characters, never hurrying the proceedings along and always allowing the conversations to play themselves out.
1726;perhaps it is just an odd coincidence that three of the very best movies of 2003 .
1727;Still, Mystic River is a mighty impressive achievement for those who made it and a rich, memorable experience for those who see it.
1728;Sean Penn is at his best.
1729;He makes you feel sympathy for a criminal type.
1730;The strong screenplay, script and cinematography are effective in portraying the gritty neighborhoods of Boston but I still found something to be missing.
1731;Perhaps as an native New Englander, I found the attempts at a Bawhstan accent to be a bit amusing at times, the actors were not even in the bawlpahk.
1732;This movie was sooo touching.
1733;Sean Penn was beyond excellent.
1734;I recommend this movie on a night at home where you just want to be reminded of how precious life can be.
1735;Most movies I watch and love in theatres are adventures and comedies.
1736;Having seen Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King, it became my favorite for Best Picture.
1737;Clint Eastwood is a masterful director, and the cast is unmatched.
1738;The fact that the biggest question of the movie isn't answered until 5 minutes before it ends meant that the entire movie was always growing in intensity.
1739;One of the years top movies, and easily worthy of being deemed a contemporary classic.
1740;Notwithstanding the unfolding of the 'complex' plot at the end, various aspects related with the movie and direction along with the innumerable appreciative and impressive press reviews remains well.
1741;able throughout is the strong ensemble cast (Tim Robbins,Sean Penn,Kevin Bacon,Lawrence Fishburne,Marcia Gay Harden).
1742;Overall an average movie but certainly not a Great one.
1743;A stranger impersonating a cop orders one of them into a car.
1744;The other two watch helplessly as their friend is abducted.
1745;And while Dave still lives in the neighborhood, he's a suspect preoccupied with his own problems.
1746;mystic River inhabits a real, day.
1747;task remarks and struggle to find the right words.
1748;Not the whodunit kind of mystery, for the detectives are sharp and evidence is everywhere.
1749;Good guys can hide the truth.
1750;Mystic River is true to its own rules, and consistent with its own universe.
1751;The pieces fit together in a way that is brilliant and disturbing.
1752;The story line and scenery was so great.
1753;Brought back memories of how it must have been growing up years ago in a big city.
1754;Everybody in this movie in amazing.
1755;They bring their a game.
1756;The story is pretty good as well, but it is the acting that really makes this movie a masterpiece.
1757;Mystic River is a director's dream when it comes to the cast.
1758;Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon all give excellent performances in this flawed masterpiece.
1759;The supporting casts exemplifies the material perfectly.
1760;Mystic River is one of the best films I have ever seen.
1761;Everything in this film is represented for a reason and various subplots connect together throughout the film, showing the mark of a talented screenwriter and director.
1762;the phenomenal cast includes probably the best actor making movies today, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Laura Linney, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne, and Emmy Rossum.
1763;Penn and Robbins give powerful performances that make Mystic River a film that simply must be experienced.
1764;a good 15 minutes could have been easily edited out.
1765;eastwood really is at the top of his game with this one.
1766;minute movie, which felt half that length), and the transforming of potential character types into human beings of great subtlety and depth.
1767;The film has a strong attachment to place (Boston), yet the shots and narrative continuity are so tight that watching them on a small computer screen did not detract from the film's compelling hold.
1768;it all works at a deep and universal level because Eastwood manages to leave most of it to the spectator's imagination.
1769;The past Eastwood aims to trace is part of the present, which ultimately proves inseparable from the past.
1770;and Eastwood keeps you guessing throughout this entire mystery, reminding me of that little gem.
1771;Dave escapes them after four days, but he's marked .
1772;the adult Dave likens it to the undead state of a vampire .
1773;eastwood, always for substance over plot, wisely pushes the emotional intangibles of Lehane's novel, bearing his camera down on these haunted men and their frailties, while offering Penn free reign to chew whatever scenery he sees fit: His Jimmy is a smart, passionate man, capable of deep love and deep hate, and always mindful of a criminal side he can tap in a flash.
1774;the rest of the cast is informed by Penn's work, and equally good.
1775;Robbins is perfectly cast as a sad.
1776;as a director, Eastwood is notoriously quick and economical
1777;Absolute Power, True Crime and Blood Work .
1778;Mystic River is stark and naturally lit.
1779;The few flourishes it takes .
1780;Mystic River is such a tense, moving experience for much of its running time that the ending, which includes a left.
1781;One of the better dramas to come along in a while.
1782;Keeps you focused and guessing as to what has happened and who did it.
1783;Terrific individual performances by a number of well known actors and a few new faces
1784;Eerie and thrilling story that will have you on the edge of your seat.
1785;Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
1786;Wasnt happy with the way it all ended but it truly portrays that in real life there isnt always a happy ending
1787;I was impressed with Mystic River.
1788;Robbins also does well as his best role since Andy Defrense.
1789;Despite this, Mystic River is brilliant.
1790;acting: 4 1/2 stars (Penn is Superb, Robbins is great, and Bacon keeps up.
1791;The first thing I would like to recommend about Mystic River is that you watch it twice before coming to any conclusions.
1792;jimmy, Dave, and Sean (played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon respectively) were childhood friends growing up in a working man neighborhood, when a cop stops to confront them about carving their names into fresh cement on the sidewalk.
1793;Dave is held captive by these monsters for four days, until he manages to escape.
1794;is Mystic River a riveting movie?
1795;Is Mystic River the kind of mystery that has you on the edge of your seat?
1796;what you will feel is that tingle of dread creeping along your spine, a vague horror constructed of real life tragedy, a shivering echo of what if, all portrayed superbly by this stellar cast.
1797;Tim Robbins is always great, but his portrayal of Dave's tortured mind is provocative and stunningly realistic
1798;and I never expected Sean Penn to develop into such an exceptional actor, Mystic River really is his finest hour on screen.
1799;The acting was inspired, the storyline is a fresh twist on a used plot, the mystery enough of an unknown to keep the pace, the dialogue believable, and the horror kept well hidden in the shadowy corners of your own imagination.
1800;over all, I highly recommend this movie.
1801;Yes, the acting is all right.
1802;Mystic River has a briliant story, this film is the best from Clint Eastwood since Unforgiven.
1803;With a terrific cast, a terrific director, and a great story, what can go wrong?
1804;It'll be a big hit.
1805;This is a good movie the first time you see it, but after that there is no reason to watch it again.
1806;The story is average at best.
1807;sean peen plays a good role in this movie.
1808;As a general rule I like to read the book before watching the movie.
1809;When I watched this production, I was constantly thinking that the story was so perfect, that the book must be great.
1810;Once the path of the three friends converges, we find ourselves in the middle of a craftily constructed story, which has all the elements that make a great mystery.
1811;besides the script being incredibly good, it allows the actors to show their best aptitudes by having very powerful scenes and a lot of interesting exchanges.
1812;Okay, the story is great, the acting is great, but the dialogues are very vague like a sort of word.
1813;but the story and acting is so good, I'll still give it 4 stars.
1814;This is a very good movie, thanks to a great performance by Sean Penn.
1815;Eastwood really captures working class Boston, it was filmed on location, you can almost smell the clam chowder.
1816;Laura Lindley is also very good as are Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.
1817;If you enjoy movies then I really can't imagine you not liking this movie, it is loaded with great preformances and the ending makes the journey worth it.
1818;It is one of the greatest movies of all time I think.
1819;Eastwood does a good job with what it is basically a faithful retelling of the book.
1820;And for the most part this works.
1821;Penn as Jimmy is terrific.
1822;All the supporting cast give superb efforts, contributing to the movie's long bass note of sadness and tragedy.
1823;Still, this is a three star effort, mainly because the stakes are higher.
1824;Lehane provides considerable layering at the start of his novel, showing the tensions that exist between the boys (and their families), and how these tensions are fueled by the economic and social status each is born in to.
1825;What a brilliant, haunting masterpiece from Clint Eastwood, easily his career's magnum opus as an auteur.
1826;It is a mystery about human behavior, about these men, their pasts, their relationships with women, and their world (the men are brought together by a murder.)
1827;As such, this is safe territory for a guy movie that plumbs deep emotion without feeling anything too personal.
1828;see for the acting alone.
1829;Kevin Bacon has matured and for the first time in many years, turns in a performance that is both dark and sympathetic.
1830;He chews a bit of scenery, but always when it's called for.
1831;eastwood directs like a man of passion, in love with his actors and his scenery, employing long takes and two.
1832;All said and done, you just have to see this one.
1833;Great movie, Great acting ( especially Sean Penn ) Great screenplay, great direction, Great cinematography, Great cast.
1834;This truly is a fine movie worthy of multiple viewings.
1835;A movie that belongs in anyone's library who like the genre.
1836;I completely enjoyed watching this film.
1837;There were times that I had to pause the film to give myself a chance to breathe.
1838;I thought about this intricate plot for days after seeing the film.
1839;This is one flick that I am happy I saw.
1840;The acting was very good in this movie, esspecially Tim Robbins character.
1841;In some ways, Mystic River reminds me of Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner, Unforgiven.
1842;Sean Penn is errie as Jimmy, definetly Oscar worthy.
1843;Marsha Gay Harden was great as Dan's belegered wife.
1844;But the best performance was by Tim Robbins as Dan, the man who's life was forever changed as a child.
1845;But the performances are outstanding as well as the direction of Eastwood, who is continually raising the bar with every movie he's made since his Unforgiven Oscar win.
1846;Read the book and was totally impressed with the writing.
1847;Expert direction by Eastwood and some fine acting by everyone.
1848;Sean Penn's best movie, undoubtedly.
1849;The finale is unexpected and keeps you on edge of seats watch it.
1850;I found this movie interesting, in part because of the characterization of blue.
1851;The view of the Mystic River with the bridge in the background is one that I have seen quite often growing up in this area.
1852;good movie with good acting.
1853;put that money toward a real live frisbee so then you will be able to throw and catch and have a good time.
1854;wonderful , if disturbing story one, acting was great across the board, and very true to the Lehane novel.
1855;Everything from the settings on down was just so well done.
1856;This movie has a great plot and an amazing cast.
1857;The acting was so terrific that it actually seemed believable.
1858;This is a great film.
1859;Penn highly deserved the Oscar for his performance in this film and the direction and supporting/co cast were all fantastic.
1860;It has you gripped until the end and leaves you breathless at it's conclusion.
1861;It has some very powerful, highly charged scenes and the whole film is acted brilliantly.
1862;It is a film that is better the first time around as you are unaware of the outcome and twists, but can easily be watched and enjoyed again and again.
1863;In this movie,the past is very important.
1864;The characters are respectable, working.
1865;Frequent references and flashbacks are made to this event and it is an important motivational factor among the three intertwined lives.
1866;Get something that will make you feel good, instead.
1867;Of course the performances by Penn, Robbins, etc are brilliant, but it really is the overall feeling this film left me with that makes it worth seeing.
1868;this is a deep character study, and poses alot of 'what if' questions.
1869;I will not say any more regarding the plot, but want to emphasize the extraordinary job done in developing the characters, and presenting the viewer with angles that are seldom thought of.
1870;Sean Penn, without a doubt, is the heart and soul of this movie.
1871;Mystic River is one of the very best of Clint Eastwood's pictures and it features highly charged emotions in a great screenplay that flows beautifully despite the length of the film.
1872;It all comes back to childhood this is something (I think) we should all know .
1873;in filmaking this film was truly a triumph.
1874;Every time the credits role I love the score.
1875;But I love CE's movies.
1876;A bit slow at times as it builds the characters, but the police drama and mystery as the story develops is excellent.
1877;The storyline is well crafted and realistically deals with human emotions and feelings, which largely are expressed without silly, needless melodrama.
1878;Very suspenseful with a great ending and a wonderful message.
1879;Wonderful direction and score by Eastwood also, by the way.
1880;Sean Penn stands out as perfect for his role, but the acting of the other major characters is top notch, as well, especially that of Marcia Gay Harden and Tim Robbins.
1881;key melodrama and sticks to the story which while somewhat improbable is so well acted that it all works.
1882;Very good movie that follows some guys from the old neighborhood for the next 20+ years.
1883;I thought it was time well spent!
1884;We both enjoyed watching it.
1885;Mystic River is perhaps Clint Eastwoods finest movie next to Unforgiving.
1886;An unrelenting look in to childhood, and penance that not only disturbs but liberates as well.
1887;Kudos to Sean Peen for another great performance, and to Eastwoods dedication to the original novel.
1888;After engaging in some mischief, the three boys are confronted by men posing as police officers.
1889;Fate draws the three men together again twenty.
1890;the cast Eastwood assembled for Mystic River is astonishing.
1891;is sophisticated enough to give each actor and actress a fully.
1892;developed story to work with and distinctive characters to inhabit.
1893;Instead, the cinema icon has produced his most mature and haunting work as a director.
1894;she was a good actress.
1895;Shows Life is what you make it
1896;This is an excellent movie with great acting.
1897;It has a surprise ending and keeps your interest all the way.
1898;I'm not even a Sean Penn fan, but he was excellent.
1899;Great storyline with lots of layers.
1900;A truly frightening film, I just didn't know in what way.
1901;Tim Robbins is fantastic as the mortally screwed.
1902;up Dave, who was kidnapped as a child by child molesters under the eyes of his two friends.
1903;Nothing is as it seems, and the unravelling of the story is fascinating.
1904;the film was made in Boston, so it has a The Departed feel to it somehow.
1905;hyperrealism that one associates with certain Steven Speilberg movies.
1906;The supposedly lower middle class neighborhood looked terrific!
1907;i agree with reviewers who praised some of the acting.
1908;There were indeed some masterful performances, although character development was virtually nil.
1909;All the actors were great.
1910;I know now to keep this one under lock and key lol.

1932;And that river keeps on flowing.
1933;Each of the main actors do an excellent job of selling their characters.

1968;If you're a fan of the series The Wire, as I am, the Colonel on that series is one of the early culprits, one of those who abducted one of the kids at the beginning.
1969;That alone was worth it.

1974;Mystic River is a film of raw emotion, and magnificent acting.

1976;Stunning performances by Laura Linney, and Marcia Gay Harden contribute to the intense realism of the film.

1992;Mystic River is a impressive achievement for those who made it and a rich, memorable experience for those who see it.
1993;pleasing, happy film, but it is a very fine drama and is rightly winning many accolades for the cast and Clint Eastwood's directing.
1994;kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Marcia Harden are very convicing and give among the best dramatical performances that we have seen this year and of their own careers.
1995;Laurence Fishburne is his usual cool and intelligent self.
1996;eastwood's direction combined with the screen play, which was based on Denis Lehane's novel, results in genuine tension, atmosphere, and subltety, expertly weaved and balanced together.
1997;i'm not sure if the performances are truly Oscar worthy, when I think of last year's nominees and winners like Adrien Brody and Daniel Day.
1998;I know Mystic River is a great film.
1999;It has unanimously great acting from the cast, and its gloomy mood is morbidly appealing.
2000;star film, deserving one win of Oscar of maybe two.
2001;In the backseat of the car, Dave (and we) realizes that a traumatic event is waiting for him.
2002;after 25 years later, Dave and Jimmy are living in the same neighborhood.
2003;the strength of the film is its actors.
2004;Tim Robbins is impeccable as a man whose tragic past haunts and torments him forever, and Sean Penn gives another great acting as a man in agony whose own personality is his worst enemy.
2005;more surprisingly, director Clint Eastwood managed to bring life to female characters, especially to Dave's wife who has to witness his husband's pains so close.
2006;Marcia Gay Harden, after her perfect turn in Pollock, is wonderful to see though this wonderful means inevitably painful.
2007;It was suspenseful and kept your interest all the way through.
2008;I will say this much for the movie, it does have some good acting and some good directing.
2009;I did enjoy Tim Robbins' performance better, but overall felt that Kevin Bacon was the real star of this movie.
2010;He was the overlooked actor in this movie and his portrayal is far more realistic and moving than either Robbins' or Penn's.
2011;Clint Eastwood has become a very talented director and has become an expert at panning back and forth from wild angle shots to small frame ones.
2012;The film gets a bonus star for Clint's direction.
2013;There is nothing absolutely uplifting or enduring about the picture.
2014;It wants to be a work of art, and in some ways it is.
2015;The acting is pretty good and so is the directing.
2016;For that, it's one star better than it should be.
2017;Mystic River is a real though provoking film that not only sheds light on the nature of revenge and grief, but shows the aftermath of both with a sharp poignancy that is heartbreaking and haunting.
2018;This is Clint Eastwoods best movie since Unforgiven, and his most powerful.
2019;Sean Penn is amazing, and if he does not get an Oscar nomination for his gut retching role, then there is something wrong in this world.
2020;Kudos To Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburn, Tim Robbins and for great supporting roles and you have one of the best movies of the year.
2021;I admit, it had me guessing and even surprised me.
2022;But all in all, I thought it was just good, not great.
2023;Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishbourn were very good.
2024;I found the movie to be extremely emotionally moving.
2025;Robbins, Penn and Linney put in outstanding performances.
2026;Bacon, Harden and Fishburn are solid as well.
2027;The Oscar nominations and wins were well deserved.
2028;But how often in life are we able to wrap things up to our liking with a big bow on top?
2029;free childhood that leads them down a successful, enlightened path in life.
2030;Linney's and Harden's family is developed much deeper in the book and goes a LONG way in explaining how they ended up the women they are today.
2031;Lehane does a decent job of explaining Dorchester.
2032;What good would it do?
2033;It certainly is a good movie, and Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were quite good in their roles.
2034;clint Eastwood did a great job directing this film, allowing the actors to take on the character's personas with stunning ability.
2035;sean Penn is PERFECT in his role and I can see why he received an Oscar.
2036;He is open and raw with his feelings, in fact so much so that your heart is almost wrenched from your own chest as a few of his scenes are played out.
2037;Sean Penn's performance is well worth the watch however.
2038;Dave, Jimmy and Sean spend a pretty normal childhood in a Boston neighborhood.
2039;Mystic River is really a brilliant movie (based on a great novel by Dennis Lehane, which is .
2040;and definitely on of the best with Clint Eastwood as a director.
2041;This movie is a good example that it is still possible to make a great movie without expensive visual effects and computer.
2042;It's just the right mixture of a great plot (it closes the gap between a thriller and a psychological drama), a perfect score, extremely good directing and outstanding performances from the ensemble, which is one of the best that Hollywood has seen in the last decade.
2043;sean Penn is probably playing the best role of his career and Tim Robbins is outstanding as the broken man who is still suffering from his childhood.
2044;Both actors got Academy Awards for their performances.
2045;Nevertheless, the rest of the great cast is doing a very good job too.
2046;kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and many actors in supporting roles contribute to the best movie of the year 2003.
2047;it's dark, encouraging, sad, exciting, brutally realistic and simply brilliant!
2048;I don't give a crap what people say about Sean Penn, he's a great actor.
2049;Good movie, great acting by all (Tim Robins also very good).
2050;A masterpiece!Clint Eastwood's direction in this film is flawless.
2051;Even the rest of the cast from the largest (Kevin Bacon) to the smallest (Penn's character's daughter) supporting role are great.
2052;But the real greatness in this film is the psychological study of three men, broken and brought back together by tragedy, and two wives: one who fears her husband (Gay Harden) and one who supports him no matter what (a Lady Macbeth.
2053;But it's there, so next to Lost In Translation, I declare it the best film so far in 2003.
2054;YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED!Bottom Line: Great film!
2055;It's rare that a movie is even nearly as good as the book on which it was based, but this is one of those rare occasions.
2056;Although the movie lacks some of the characters' interior life that a book can provide, the faithful visualization of the book's little world and the extraordinary performances add a dimension the book could not provide.
2057;Read the book, but certainly see the movie.
2058;great work by a well known and famous producer.
2059;captivating, edge of your seat thriller.
2060;highly recommend, would watch this one again.
2061;There are some movies that draw attention from awards shows.
2062;there are some that draw fan attention.
2063;I honestly say that this movie has NO redeeming qualities.
2064;Mystic River is much more than a good crime story.
2065;The Mystic River, actually running through Boston, provides the dramatic backdrop for many scenes and events, both past and present.
2066;He has a beautiful wife (Laura Linney) and three daughters.
2067;Dave (Tim Robbins), married with a son, tries to be a good husband and father, but is tormented by the demons born in his past, trying desperately to keep them submerged.
2068;The questions loom throughout their lives.

2070;star cast (including Laurence Fishburne and Marcia Gay Harden).
2071;Fortunately the author agreed to the direction of Clint Eastwood (his 24th) and the two worked closely together to keep the film in sync with the novel.
2072;Obviously, I knew what was coming all along.
2073;read and the film is a must.
2074;The casting is superb and the gut.
2075;wrenching performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are not to be missed.
2076;star cast that brings a great detail and grit to the film.
2077;Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively.
2078;Marcia Gay Harden was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and she's quite good as Robbin's uncertain wife.
2079;Also adding greatly is the first.
2080;rate, Oscar nominated script .
2081;section alone makes Mystic River worthwhile.
2082;Overall, Mystic River is a solid drama, although it does have a few debits.
2083;Director Clint Eastwood made the correct decision in Mystic River to closely follow the vision and story portrayed in the best selling novel by local Boston writer Dennis Lehane.
2084;When he tells contradictory stories suspicions naturally multiply.
2085;the Mystic River holds the key as bodies are dumped there.
2086;It's an interesting slice of low.
2087;Excuse me, but when was Clint Eastwood considered an important film.
2088;At best, he's an okay actor.
2089;Best advice is to watch it for yourself, like I did, then make up your own mind.
2090;He's a fine actor even if he acts the same way in all his films.
2091;Tim Robbins character was more clearly defined, and I enjoyed his performance more.
2092;Sean Penn is a really good actor.
2093;Good twist at the end.
2094;If you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch.
2095;top that it's actually somewhat amusing), and Tim Robbins (who has made a career out of being overrated) won Oscars for this piece of manipulative hackwork is downright surreal.
2096;Movie was ok and the acting was decent.
2097;Such a a high power cast .
2098;keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concernedAgain he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.
2099;the story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong.
2100;off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good.
2101;I enjoyed this movie because it was unpredictable.
2102;for a basic plot summary, Mystic River tells the story of three childhood friends now grown up but still intertwined with each other:.
2103;jimmy Markum (Sean Penn): The intense, mob.
2104;dealer type who's daughter is murdered and provides the investigative basis for the film.
2105;the good thing about this movie is that it contains enough interesting themes (both physical and emotional) to keep the viewer engaged.
2106;You'll really be curious as the movie unfolds to see how all this will turn out.
2107;In, say, Million Dollar Baby, Eastwood is perfect in resolving all the themes and character development.
2108;that being said, this is still an okay movie.
2109;Now, is it as good as the Academy thought it was in '03?
2110;Clint Eastwood, who directed this film, proves he is one of our best directors, and the cast representing families in a working class Connecticut town is excellent.
2111;There are many twists and turns and local color, which help us get to know the actors and the town well enough to care about the resolution of the case.
2112;sean Penn and Kevin Bacon had an outstanding performance.
2113;i have trouble with the book's premise, where it is a remarkable coincidence that two murders occur simultaneously, in the same area, amonst the same set of people.
