1;One of the best movies of all time.
2;good movie as well as an emotional comedy.
3;A classic and a must have.
4;he is abselutely hilarious while simaltaneously being simple and blissfully unaware.
5;it is easily the best tom hanks movie ever made.
6;it is a very emotional movie from watchimg gump struggle to walk as a child up to when his loved ones began dying.
7;there are a lot of people who play thier roles well here.
8;it is long,but an abselute gem in any video library.
9;This is an absolute classic.
10;I love, love, love this movie.
11;Tom Hanks is genius in this role, and it made me add him onto my list of favorite actors.
12;(He was good in Castaway, too.)
13;I also love the soundtrack .
14;all the relevant songs from the time period.
15;This is one of the best movies ever made.
16;"(APOLLO 13 works because a skilled ensemble cast and a wooden ""hero"" to lead them can be a highly effective device."
17;He has a presence that we'll enjoy for many years.
18;It starts by telling you it is who your Mom knows that is important, not what you know.
19;created with some historical scenes.
20;Another amusing spot is putting Forrest on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon.
21;His money is invested in an apple company and he becomes so rich he can work for free!
22;The very interesting story of an autistic man played by Tom Hanks.
23;He makes the most of what he has that's for certain.
24;And this movie is not a very good one.
25;one of my teachers in high school told the class that a plausible story isn't necessary a true one, but can also be something that technically MIGHT happen in real life.
26;Forrest just had TOO many strokes of good luck and situations where he was at the right place at the right time to make it a good story in that respect.
27;many people here speak of the movie's great message of the triumph of human nature.
28;I think that he has great potential as an actor .
29;Forrest Gump starring Tom Hanks is still a sweet, tearjerker, and honest film about a man who may not have all his marbles intact but his sweet nature and common sense make him special wherever he goes.
30;Great performance by Hanks, Robin Wright, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise.
31;I can see why the Academy Awards gave this movie the best picture nod.
32;This film will touch your heart and make you laugh for sure.
33;Tom Hanks is the best, and this chocolate box it is so nice to my girlfriend
34;The movie itself has everything: love, drama, comedy, action.
35;and the acting is fantastic.
36;it has excellent special features that give you information about how they made the movie, including featurettes about some of the cooler effects.
37;But to its credit Gump is a tear jerker at its best.
38;A good film in its own Gump.
39;For a movie that's 7 years old, they provided great documentaries, technical and special effect details, and many other extras.
40;A: 5/5 StarsThis movie was an excellent blend of tears, laughter, and music.
41;award winning performance as Forrest Gump, a man with an I. q. of 75.
42;In the midst of all of this, we also see the change of American society over the three decades the movie covers.
43;this movie is very moving and inspiring.
44;What could we accomplish?Winner of six Academy Awards, this movie is definitely one of the best movies ever.
45;j: 5/5 StarsWhat a passionately magical movie.
46;and when your finished the overall essence and feeling is so profound that you know you will remember it for a long time.
47;forrest gump was one of the best movies of 1994.
48;He may not be the smartest of people( his IQ is 75 but he is honest and innocent.
49;kind of a memory of the time when we were all ignorant but still pure.
50;it is also ultimately about his relationship with his childhood girlfriend, and how all their experiences lead them to a conclusion both heart.
51;their experiences trough each decade might differ in many volumes but together they are a symbol and reminder of that time.
52;tom hanks shows again that he is one of the greatest actors of our time and generation.
53;He is able to evoke th essence of forrest gump and not over sentimentalize his being.
54;As for the rest of the movie, each scene shines with the love and care of the people who created it.
55;Forrest gump is a landmark for the years passed and to come and it will remain in the hearts of viewers forever.
56;For me, Forrest Gump is one of the best movies ever.
57;"As Forrest grows up, we learn that he might be a little goofy, but sure his heart is giant
I:8439;58;Technically Forrest Gump is a masterpiece"
59;Forrest Gump is simply a beautiful movie with a heart of its own.
60;Forrest Gump is a great movie and always will be.
61;Everything in this movie is great.
62;This movie may even be Tom Hank's best movie.
63;Everything in this movie is fantastic.
64;Well what can i say a great movie I enjoy watching it , and many of my friend do, too.
65;I really enjoy being able to see my favorite parts over and over again.
66;this is one of my most favorite movie of all time.
67;this movie is about a man that has a kinda learning disability yet he is the hero.
68;What is NOT to love about this movie?
69;great plot and just a great snuggle up on the couch and celebrate life movie!!
70;Huge fan of this movie!
71;The film had outrageous explanations for everything from the smiley face (Have a nice day!)
72;enjoy the story and music .
73;Forrest Gump is considered a classic for a reason.
74;It's got historical references, heart breaking moments, outrageously funny lines, and amazing special effects somehow all wrapped up into the same movie.
75;I defy you to find a better made and better thought.
76;This is my kids all time favorite other than the Disney Cartoons.
77;This movies is one of my husbands favorites to watch over and over even though you know what is going to happen he still watches it.
78;He probably got it just so he could be one of the actors who got back.
79;The film is good, but not great.
80;It does have an excellent soundtrack going for it, but music does not make a film(unless it's a musical!)
81;Gary Sinise puts in a great performance as Lt. Dan.
82;but is a nice gift for fans of the show.
83;Gump is not very smart, yet manages to do so many things right in this film, including becoming a football star, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, a Ping Pong champion, a distance runner, and eventually a multi.
84;the history of a turbulent era in American history and some of its leaders and failures make the film worth viewing.
85;Watching a naf like Gump serve as both catalyst and pawn in our history is far fetched, but still fascinating to watch.
86;the actors are terrific and make the film one we will remember.
87;This is a great gift for the Forrest Gump lover in your life.
88;A nice piece of memorabilia, as well.
89;Forrest Gump mixes so many styles of film in one movie it is incredible.
90;It is a comedy, drama, war movie, love story, one of spiritual enlightenment, but most importantly it is about a life.
91;How in a positive way have we touched others during our life?The Blu.
92;ray version of this film is like watching it again for the first time.
93;The battle scene is visually striking.
94;Yorrick was the king's jester and Hamlet spent a great time with him when he was younger.
95;"As he holds his skull, he speaks the lines, ""My gorge rises at it (his skull)"" meaning his throat rises at it."
96;I always took this to mean his spirit was moved to the point of being choked up!
97;There are quite a few scenes in this film that bring me to that point.
98;A wonderful and inspirational movie.
99;This clearly demonstrates why you always have to look deeper to appreciate who someone is.
100;A wonderful, positive and uplifting movie that never gets old.
101;it should really be viewed on as big a screen as possible.
102;Every time you watch it you will notice and appreciate new details carefully incorporated by the script writer.
103;One of the best movies ever made.
104;Great edition of the film.
105;Additional content is on the second disc is impressive.
106;I've seen it 5 times Tom Hanks was really convincing.
107;Watched it many years ago when it was 1st released and didn't really like it but watched it again recently and really enjoyed it.
108;I could watch it a hundred times Tom Hanks is a great actor.
109;Thank for having it on amazon.
110;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
111;I never saw it before, and it was a pleasant surprise.
112;Our family loves watching this movie .
113;it is one of my son's favorites.
114;This has been one my favorite movies ever made.
115;This will always remain a classic.
116;This is a marvelous classic.
117;Interesting weave of real history and Forrest's life.
118;Tom Hanks is especially wonderful here.
119;it is one of my favorite movie.
120;this is probably the second best work by Tom Hanks, Saving Private Ryan would be the first.
121;If you want to watch a classic then this is it.
122;Absolutly love this film from beginning to end it grips you and you really feel invested in the life of Forest.
123;Its a very touching film, with some very genuine sad moments.
124;It also made me laugh too.
125;The special edition version has some special festures which increase your knowledge of the making of and the life of Forest.
126;if you haven't watched this film yet then you should do it right now!!
127;There is section on the visual effects that were done in the movie.
128;I find it very interesting.
129;I also highly recomend the movie to anyone who likes Tom Hanks and his work.
130;I had forgotten how much I love this movie.
131;A triumph in film making and feel good story telling.
132;gump gives us a vision of true loyalty in friendship, he is patient, kind, doesn't hold grudges (doesn't keep accounting of wrongs suffered), he believes all things and hopes in all things.
133;This movie is very enlightening and a true pleasure to watch.
134;it is fun to watch, it is entertaining, it is a good family movie (older kids) and it is definitely a thinking movie and a challenge to how we all live.
135;they still live, protected by the shadow of the gates of forrest's late 20th century mansion.
136;how any person could accept an oscar after tom hanks won for this movie escapes me.
137;Tom Hanks is a perfect match to the character.
138;This has to be the most overrated movie of all time.
139;like sentimentality and makes the characters and situations as deep and fulfilling as a damp dish rag.
140;I was excited to share this beloved movie with my daughters and they loved the storytelling style of the movie and fell in live with the unforgettable character of Forest Gump.
141;anything Tom Hanks is amazing.
142;this movie is funny and touching serious and just down right awesome.
143;Sally Field is always great
144;Perfectly entertaining the entire movie!
145;No dry areas in the movie it always was moving.
146;Fun movie to sit and watch over and over again.
147;One interpretation of the movie is that of having opinions and siding one way or the other on issues.
148;He wins the medal of honor in Vietnam yet loves a girl who is mixed in with people who oppose the war.
149;When Forrest meets the president all he has to say about it is he loved how there was free Dr. Pepper and free food.
150;Although stupid, he is still a very dynamic character who succeeds at everything he does, and still remains a nice guy.
151;He inspires many others and spreads his good influence around very well and doesn't even realize how great he is.
152;Yet he manages to leave the world a little better than he found it.
153;i can't totally agree with the thought that the film portrays sexuality as immoral.
154;The kid turns out just fine and Forrest turns out to be a great father.
155;will the story of Forrest Gump make you feel inspired?
156;Will it actually change your life?
157;Forrest Gump is the best movie I have ever seen in my whole life.
158;I am so happy that it got all those Oscars, because it really deserved it.
159;This is a real CLASSIC!
160;I love this movie and I watch it at least once a month.
161;This is a great gift for the true fan of Forrest.
162;The story is actually good in my opinion, or at least the idea behind it.
163;He won back to back Oscars for barely doing anything.
164;The final frames of the film are truly the strongest, and yes, when he realizes that he has a child his reaction is raw and real and heartbreaking, especially when he asks if his son is smart, but honestly that is one scene (the best scene in the film mind you) and one scene does not make you a good actor.
165;Like I said, it's done well, really well, but that still doesn't make up for the lapses in judgment on the part of the writers, directors and lead actor (at least he tries in some scenes here as apposed to his horrendously mediocre `Philadelphia' performance the previous year).
166;nominated `Heavenly Creatures') I am dumbfounded that the world fell for this living breathing clich , wrapped in a feel good package.
167;It's perfectly directed by Robert Zemeckis.
168;The film is funny, exciting, romantic, and sad.
169;It deserved all the Oscars that it won.
170;This is my favourite movie of all time.
171;ridden cynical 20th century minds for a couple of hours, and enjoy a beautiful, touching, funny and wonderfully acted feelgood movie.
172;Apart from that unnecessary section, the film is a delight to watch, and the scene where Forrest turns away from Jenny and says I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.
173;brings tears to my cynical angst.
174;ridden 20th century eyes every time.
175;He is good at running (which gets him into college).
176;He fulfills a promise he made to his dying best friend (who died in his arms) and enters the shrimp boat industry.
177;"He has a child with his future wife and the kid is the ""smartest"" in his class."
178;And all throughout this improbable story, he remains blissfully ignorant at how extraordinary it is.
179;i want a film about the real world.
180;One of the best movies of all time and really shows a lot of historical events that occurred in history.
181;You can find everything in this movie: joy, sadness, love,some cruelty of war, a lot jokes, serenity and big, big hope and belief in human being.
182;Forrest Gump is an amazingly put together movie.
183;It is the best movie I had ever watched.
184;But the way events change his life are nicely interlaced in movie.
185;Therefore, I had a lot of expectations going in to watching the movie.
186;A Wonderful Movie To Own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
187;We Need More Men Like Forrest Gump, What A Beautiful World This Would Be!
188;It makes you laughit makes you cry.
189;Tom Hanks is amazing, as well as his talented and spectacular supporting cast!
190;this awesome movie has Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright and all the other great cast.
191;Great acting and wonderful story weaves through events of the 60s, 70s and 80s.
192;This movie distorts the history of our nation by placing a half witted dunce in some of our countries finest moments.
193;"I do recommend the adult remake of this film ""Forrest Hump."""
194;Well I can sympathize with the feeling.
195;After all, Australia has produced some pretty embarrassing lifestyle movies, including Muriel's Wedding, Strictly ballroom and Crocodile Dundee.
196;So I guess we should all just relax and enjoy the film.
197;forrest Gump was an adorable piece of cinema.
198;Every now and then a movie comes out that is simply refreshing, and this was one of the best.
199;i had fun with the movie on many levels.
200;The script was full of double meanings and clever references.
201;The special effects were flawless and yet unnoticed.
202;The winding, serendipitous path Gump's life took was surprisingly believable.
203;Forrest Gump is the sort of film that leaves you feeling good but also prompts you to wonder about the true meaning of life.
204;No one should feel embarrassed by this great film.
205;Forrest Gump is probably one of my many favorite all time movies.
206;ray movie i've seen in a while.
207;A very intelligent comedy and one of the best reviews of 20th century America in a very light hearted way.
208;Fully deservant of the shower of Oscars it received.
209;I saw the movie the same day the package arrived and I enjoyed it as much as when I saw it the first time at the theater.
210;The movie is fast paced and pretty entertaining.
211;My personal opinion is that Forrest Gump is one of the best movies of all time.
212;Best movie of this generation.
213;Covers the popular culture of the era with wisdom and empathy.
214;It is truly an inspirational film, it is touching to see the main character's generosity and outlook in life despite all the struggles.
215;war rallies, and becomes a success.
216;"when all is said and done, all Forrest really wants is to find his very best friend in the world so that they can ""be just like peas and carrots"" again."
217;hanks plays the role convincingly.
218;Forrest has no guile, is completely trusting, and his childlike wonder and limitations make him an endearing and enduring character.
219;there is a smattering of foul language, amd there are scenes portraying drug and alcohol abuse, as well as war violence, etc. all in all, this is a great show.
220;You will be glad you watched!A strong 4.
221;it is amazing what you kan do, if u stick to it.
222;Both of these movies are excellent and full of entertainment from start to the end.
223;borrows a lot from Woody's Zelig but it is a real Odessy.
224;As long as there is a good internet connection, the film streams great.
225;It was a pleasure to view the film again.
226;He is excellent at portraying himself as an ignorant southern man.
227;Also, Tom Hanks does an amazing job imitating a southern accent.
228;the visual effects of the movie are very impressive.
229;the rating for this movie, PG.13, fits the movie very well.
230;Also, the movie has such an exciting plot.
231;The plot and the movie, as a whole, are so interesting and a great movie to watch that it is so hard to get distracted from watching it.
232;"I believe that the message is no matter how ignorant or stupid you are
I:8439;233;Whether it was the amazing visual effects or the extremely attention.
I:8439;234;It is a great movie and I encourage everyone to see it.
I:8439;235;I absolutely love this movie, it's such a wonderful film based on the novel of the same name.
I:8439;236;Tom Hanks is great as Forrest Gump, from speech to mannerisms, makes one appreciate those who have autism or other special needs.
I:8439;237;The product arrived in excellent time and plays wonderfully.
I:8439;238;I encourage anyone to watch this movie, to keep an open mind about those with special needs.
I:8439;239;Europeans know how to appreciate good films way better than US industry, so it is no surprise that Pulp Fiction won at the Cannes Festival, and Forrest Gump won the Oscar.
I:8439;240;This movie can help us to achieve our goals in life.
I:8439;241;the cinemetography is exclusive and brilliant, from the point where young Forrest runs out of his braces to the look of terror on his face when he is carrying Bubba out of the enemy fire.
I:8439;242;this is a beautiful movie, showing the tenderness and the courage of one young man who can doing anything he sets his mind to do.
I:8439;243;He ran across the United States, and when he was done, he had nothing better to do than to run across it again, and again, and again.
I:8439;244;the little girl who played Jenny was spectacular, especially the part where she runs to the fields, hides, and prays to God, Dear God, please make me a bird, so I can fly far, far away!
I:8439;245;It made me cry great big crocodile tears.
I:8439;246;the little boy who played Hanks as a child was great, too.
I:8439;247;haley Joel Osment, who played Forrest Jr. has always been a favorite little actor of mine.
I:8439;248;I liked him in the Jeff Foxworthy Show and other shows I've seen him in.
I:8439;249;She got her illness from sleeping around and using drugs, so I reckon that must be what she had.
I:8439;250;Yet, she did a tremendous and wonderful role as his mother in Forrest Gump.
I:8439;251;Sally Field has got to be one of my favorite actresses.
I:8439;252;well, if you haven't seen Forrest Gump now, I hope you watch it.
I:8439;253;It is worth every minute.
I:8439;254;The music is great and all the actors are fit for their roles.
I:8439;255;She's determined to see that he gets the best education possible.
I:8439;256;forrest also has a friend, Jenny, the girl who let him sit beside her on the school bus the first day, and they were """"like peas and carrots"""" after that."""
257;"star football team, the second was Johnson as he was awarded the medal of honor for bravery in Vietnam (great story there
I:8439;258;For example, when he meets Nixon, the president asks him how he likes Washington, and does he like his hotel.
I:8439;259;he makes friends here and there, and these people keep popping up in his life in unexpected ways.
I:8439;260;there's a lot of humor, and a lot of pathos, and they are mixed together just right.
I:8439;261;It's artfully done, and I'm not at all surprised that it earned six Oscars, including best picture.
I:8439;262;It's one of the best I've ever seen.
I:8439;263;I have always liked Tom Hanks and after seeing this movie it was a 'must have'.
I:8439;264;It just shows that anyone can accomplish anything.
I:8439;265;It is one of my very favorites and I recenlty gave this to a colleague for a gift.
I:8439;266;Just love the story and the message.
I:8439;267;As everyone already knows, the story of Forrest Gump is timeless and something that will be viewed for generations to come.
I:8439;268;The colors and definition are crisp.
I:8439;269;Take a look and you'll notice great clarity in each scene.
I:8439;270;The 5.1 sound is decent.
I:8439;271;now for the special features.
I:8439;272;Disc 1 offers great, comprehensive commentaries by the producers and the director, Robert Zemeckis.
I:8439;273;While other directors provide useless information, this commentary is actually informative and pertinent to what's shown on screen.
I:8439;274;Disc 2 is simply amazing.
I:8439;275;Considering how great the special effects were, this set of bonus features are very welcome and entertaining.
I:8439;276;The creativity, honesty and humor are well balanced.
I:8439;277;As usual, in keeping with the white savior theme, a white man rescues a black man and helps the black man start a business.
I:8439;278;Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE loved it.
I:8439;279;the actors, the direction, the story EVERYTHING about this movie worked.
I:8439;280;It's a movie that will remain a classic forever.
I:8439;281;There's something here for everyone.
I:8439;282;Unopened and in perfect condition, I was very pleased with my order.
I:8439;283;Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie.
I:8439;284;A classic movie that everyone must watch, not only because of its brilliance but also because of its modern.
I:8439;285;Very good got what I wanted.
I:8439;286;Forest gump is one of those amazing movies that u can watch all day every day
I:8439;287;Special mention deserves the music on the film, going over most of the hits of the late 50's and the 60's.
I:8439;288;But this is a movie, a very good movie.
I:8439;289;So it's a piece of entertainment, and I just watched the movie today (I just watched a couple of times when I came out 12 years ago), and I had a lot of fun.
I:8439;290;As an example, when Gump goes to the Army, he is very good just following orders, not even thinking about it, so his Sargent tells him """"You must have an IQ of 160!"""""""
291;"That, in my opinion, is really funny, and a very witty critic to the Army, where all they need is ""robots"" who can just obey without even thinking."
292;There is also something remarkable.
293;Jenny, the woman of his dreams, is there.
294;And that is something that has rarely been told.
295;"The mother thinks Forrest should have the same opportunities as anybody else, so she offers herself to do ""anything"" possible to allow Forrest to go to a regular school."
296;And the Principal takes advantage of her.
297;Read between the lines!To end with this review, I will just say that this is a GREAT movie, very entertaining, well done (the sound in the war scenes is just superb!)
298;, a pleasure to watch, with a lot of fun moments, some tender ones, and it tells us a little bit about the history of the US from the 50's to the 80's.
299;It is a very witti one, and it deserves the place it made in the History of Cinema.
300;It is one of the greatest movies that was ever made.
301;I grew up watching this movie and what made it beautiful was me catching something new every time.
302;Yes some things were more adult than others but nonetheless its a movie that I will keep in my family for years to come.
303;One of Tom Hanks best films.
304;He is loyal, kind, brave, loving, patient, adventurous and has a GREAT sense of humor.
305;And that's all I have to say about that.
306;Forrest Gump is indeed one of the best movie I've seen.
307;The cast, script, and special effects were all wonderful.
308;I love this movie, I saw it over six times, and I still and will always love the movie.
309;Forrest Gump is a great movie, and I can watch it over and over again.
310;"It is one of my best movies, and I advise everyone to watch this movie
I:8439;311;This is one of the best movies, I've ever seen.
I:8439;312;For those of you who are wondering whether to get the regular blu ray or the chocolate box set, got with the regular.
I:8439;313;and it was worth the wait.
I:8439;314;It is such a wonderful movie.
I:8439;315;The package is highly deserved.
I:8439;316;The second disc is awesome.
I:8439;317;I love Tom Hanks and I think this movie is one of his very best!
I:8439;318;Funny movie about how a nerd or a village idiot could lead a perfect life against all odds.
I:8439;319;has humor, warmth, and lots of love.
I:8439;320;a simple man who looks at life through simple eyes
I:8439;321;Its a fun movie, with help from a great performance by Sally Field as Gump's mother, and another one from Gary Sinise as the disabled Lt. Dan.
I:8439;322;There's some great visual effects, and its a fun movie with a little bit for everybody.
I:8439;323;the extras are pretty cool too.
I:8439;324;I believe it was one of Tom Hanks best movie portrayals and my only regret was that it wasn't provided in UV for my VUDU collection.
I:8439;325;It does contain more strong language than I remembered and some sexual content, but they survived it (and enjoyed it).
I:8439;326;This movie is a classic!
I:8439;327;tom Hanks gives the best proformence ever.
I:8439;328;this is a all time great.
I:8439;329;this is my best good movie.
I:8439;330;It's a classic and you won't forget it.
I:8439;331;This is the best of Tom's works so far.
I:8439;332;This is one of his best works so far.
I:8439;333;Definitely in the top 100 of movies of all times.
I:8439;334;Works with all age groups.
I:8439;335;besides great acting it had some unique production elements.
I:8439;336;He rolls through the decades and manages to become part of a great many historical events.
I:8439;337;If you get into the spirit of which this movie was intended you'll enjoy it immensely.
I:8439;338;There are some good laughs, some tear.
I:8439;339;jerking moments and some scenes that just make you roll your eyes and say Oh, Brother.
I:8439;340;I, however, thought is was great.
I:8439;341;Had the kids watch it for the first time, and they loved it too.
I:8439;342;This seemingly simple film is really a modern.
I:8439;343;day classic that gets better every time you watch it.
I:8439;344;Recommend it to ANYONE who loves action, war, a couple laughs, a couple cries, and yeah girls, theres some romatic parts.
I:8439;345;I may mock I make fun of but in the end i enjoyed watching this movie, over and over again.
I:8439;346;It is one of those films that allow for the corny one liners and yet a lighter side to some serious events.
I:8439;347;The romantic side of this movie for me is unforgettable, as is the music.
I:8439;348;Tom Hanks is brilliant in this film and I would recommend it to anybody.
I:8439;349;It has loads of drama, comedy, romance, and even aspects of historical character (Although it is a bit distorted) This is the best film I have ever seen and I can't emphasize enough how perfect it is for all movie.
I:8439;350;Classic movie with a good storyline.
I:8439;351;Tom hanks plays his role well.
I:8439;352;This is a movie I watched growing up!
I:8439;353;Superb plot and a great historical fiction.
I:8439;354;I would recommend this movie for families to watch together.
I:8439;355;This is an old show that was well know in it's day, and now is not up to date enough to enjoy.
I:8439;356;One of my most favorite movies!!
I:8439;357;One of Tom Hanks' best performances.
I:8439;358;Great balance of humor and fact
I:8439;359;This may be Tom Hanks best performance ever.
I:8439;360;Wonderful characters, enchanting story line including most of the important historical events of our nations from the 60s and 70s.
I:8439;361;Tom Hanks shines in one of his best performances ever.
I:8439;362;This is a classic movie about love, loss, and love again all wrapped up with a little humor and great screenplay.
I:8439;363;if you havent seen it yet, pick it up!
I:8439;364;I absolutely love Tom Hanks and if I had to pick a favorite it would probably be this one.
I:8439;365;Sally Field is great in this as well but it's Tom who really makes it shine.
I:8439;366;He does a phenomenal job of playing Forrest Gump, an Alabama man whose life is chronicled from childhood through adulthood as he faces many challenges and experiences many triumphs.
I:8439;367;The movie is funny at times, heartwarming at others, and truly entertaining from start to finish.
I:8439;368;All around an excellent film.
I:8439;369;Tom Hanks is the most likable actor from his generation.
I:8439;370;Forrest Gump has a good heart and guts, his life is a good full life.
I:8439;371;Forrest Gump is one of the best characters in movie history.
I:8439;372;he is beyond his years and appreciates the older classics.
I:8439;373;great movie lived through all of the eras.
I:8439;374;One of many Tom Hanks best performances.
I:8439;375;If you have to read this you were raised wrong my friend, this is a movie of he ages.
I:8439;376;This film is a life affirming 'feel good' viewing experience and you will feel as though you know Forrest personally when it's over.
I:8439;377;Great special effects, superb acting, and a well.
I:8439;378;paced story make this one of the most watchable films I've ever seen.
I:8439;379;he in the begging couldn't walk good but then he learned and he was confident.
I:8439;380;this movie won an oscar for best pictures.
I:8439;381;but this movie is funny touching and it is a good movie for people that like story telling since this movie is a about a person telling a story about his past.
I:8439;382;Of course we all enjoyed watching this classic.
I:8439;383;This is by far my favorite movie.
I:8439;384;Tom Hanks does agreat job, I loved the plot, it's a just great movie altogether.
I:8439;385;If you haven't seen it then I won't spoil it for you, but I assure you that you will love this movie.
I:8439;386;I can see Tom Hanks winning an Oscar for his portrayal of this fictitious character"
387;I found the film entertaining even though in reality, this kind of life led by someone like Forrest Gump would be highly improbable.
388;He was definitely perfect for this part.
389;He really caught your attention throughout the whole movie.
390;He has a learning disability and is fitted for braces on his legs.
391;I got this for her as a Christmas gift.
392;This was a great movie.
393;I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a cute movie to watch.
394;It's now my new favorite movie!
395;Simply just love this movie.
396;Would recommend this movie to everyone I talk to

402;Forrest Gump is one of my husband's favorite movie's.
403;It is real, good story line.
404;Forrest Gump and Cast Away are my favorite movies by Tom Hanks.
405;Of course he has been great in a lot more.
406;Some reason I am reflecting back to classic movies I grew up with that I enjoyed.
407;Overall, It is a very good movie.
408;This is a good one .
409;packed, thriller, just a good ol' watch with the family kind of movie.
410;This is one of the all time great story telling movies.
411;I recommend rewatching it if it has been a while.

413;So my husband and I both watched it and we both liked it.
414;I loved adding this to my collection!!
415;looking for the perfect Christmas gift, found this online and he loves it, especially the added 'extras' in this special collector's edition.
416;Always enjoy the performances in Forrest Gump, and the timeless lesson Mama says, 'Stupid is as stupid does'.
417;My best friend introduced the film to me.
418;Fortunately, I watched it again as my friend kept telling me that it was a great movie.
419;I got to like Tom Hanks at that time.
420;I think Forrest's character is well reflected to Tom Hank's own character as I observe his role in other films.
421;i admire him because he is true to his nation, his friends, and his family and himself.
422;He keeps every promise when he makes one.
423;This is a truly a amazing movie.You'll howl with laughter when you understand all the jokes in this movie.
424;his mother and a girl,Jenny are the only people who treat him well.
425;I dub this movie as the Must See American Movie of all time.
426;It captures the american spirit.
427;it's a heartwarming tale of an underdog but with lots of humor.
428;harsh views of reality are peppered with a light note as Forrest's personality shines as the light of innocent American dreaming.
429;this is one film I can watch again and again and still feel just as enthralled by its charm.
430;He enjoyed it almost as much as we did watching it again.
431;If you love this movie, you'll love all the extras.
432;A classic movie you enjoy every single time you watch it.
433;played well,so I give you three stars.
434;one of my favorite movies.
435;In my opinion, one of the greatest movies of all time.
436;You can't help but be moved by this movie.
437;the technology used to place him in historic footage was quite fascinating.
438;the soundtrack is awesome as well.
439;I want to watch it all the time, and them watch it some more.
440;What a great story that so many middle aged can relate to.
441;He had so much to do with so many memorable things from years ago.
442;One of Tom Hanks best movies overall!
443;directed by Robert Zemeckis (Contact) is one of his best directed films, He did also win for Best Director.
444;Tom Hanks win his Second Oscar for this role.
445;The film also win an Oscar for the Great Visual Effects, Best Adapated Screenplay, Best Editing and Best Picture.
446;It was Oscar Nominated for Best Supporting Actor:Gary Sinise, Best Art Direction.
447;set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound, Best Make.
448;up and Best Original Score by Alan Silvestri.
449;One of the few early great films from the ninties.
450;I like the plot of this movie to show how life is full of surprises .
451;One of my favorite movies to watch whenever I see the title.
452;By far one of Americas greatest mock history films.
453;The first time I saw this movie I thought it was funny and good to watch.
454;I like and respect all the actors in this movie, and I think this movie was the pivotal point in Tom Hanks acting career, in which he became very diverse and a multi.
455;My family loves this movie.
456;It is one of our favorites.
457;It is on our top 10 list of all time.
458;Loved sharing this movie with my son this weekend!
459;Additionally, the simple premise of Forrest's perspective is well.
460;It's a nice, slow, emotionally uplifting film.
461;This is one film that is a must in the collection.
462;i don't think it was good enough to have won best picture, but ive dissagreed with a couple of the best picture winners this decade!the film is and will be a classic for years to come
463;This is a good movie.
464;This is a old classic.
465;She was the brilliant black actress who played the reporter who followed Tom Hanks cross.
466;Looks and sounds great on blu.
467;ray, and contains a really good range of extras.
468;if you haven't seen Forrest Gump in several years,you'll love this.
469;after watching the movie and then the bonus material,you'll have a whole new appreciation for the concept that was Forrest Gump.
470;highy recommended for movie buffs.
471;i just got my blu.
472;Probably one of the greatest movies ever made.
473;Good story and good acting by Tom Hanks.
474;Would definitely recommend this to anyone over 13 yrs old
475;I was very surprised to receive this in the condition it was in .
476;completely wrapped in the original plastic wrapping, and it was actually a two.
477;(a few months ago) Very pleased, this is one of my favorite movies!
478;What a classic for the ages!
479;One of the best movies ever!
480;This is the story of Forrest Gump, a simple minded man who lives an extraordinary life.
481;Cause it is just great story telling at its bestPS that is all I have to say about this
482;I had to added it to my library so I can watch it over again.
483;One of the best movies ever.
484;Listen to the whole detailed life story of smart.
485;This truely is a good movie, played very well by Tom Hanks.
486;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
487;i loved the music, the script, and the characters.
488;I normally don't like Tom Hanks but in this movie he is wonderful.
489;Great condition and love this movie.
490;My daughter was excited to watch this classic movie.
491;I'm glad I can share it with her.
492;oh wait, I got carried away.
493;The movie transfer was great.
494;Everything that we know and love, the moments, the scenes that touch us.
495;The 2nd disc is even better!
496;, its worth your money to order this incredible journey of Forrest's life that we see through his eyes how beautiful life is in a simplistic way.
497;But for those who haven't seen it i think you will enjoy this.
498;any category that it goes under it is a very deserving movie to be there.
499;Tis is an inspirational movie and i would reccomend it to movie goers of all kinds.
500;One of the best movie ever !
501;The story is nicely tell.
502;My biggest regret about this movie is that I probably won't ever be able to share it with my granddaughter.
503;this film is simply brilliant.
504;It looks simple on the outside, but contains a lot of profound material deep inside.
505;Again, another view of American history expressing passion and sincerity .
506;this is a great film that never loses its appeal with time.
507;I enjoyed watching it when it first came out years ago and enjoyed seeing it again years later.
508;Have seen Forrest Gump many times and it is enjoyable each time.
509;I like Tom Hanks and this is one of his best movies.
510;It truly is a beautiful story mostly because you really start to care about this man named Forrest.
511;The film itself, a plot very poposterous, is moved through by performances by Hanks and Robyn Wright.
512;i think that most people are touched by this film and I was after concidering it deeply.
513;I hope this makes sense and I hope this helps anyone whose never seen this film (I highly doubt theres anyone else who hasn't.
514;Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, decides at one point, to start walking.
515;This is one film that is worth missing.
516;But other than that I though it was a good movie.
517;This movie is a definate classic.
518;This is a sweet story about Forrest and his undying love of his friend Jenny.
519;"I also feel that the line ""Life is a box of chocolates.you never know what you'll get."""
520;"While it deserves the best picture Oscar I was pulling for ""Pulp Fiction""."
521;Tom Hanks does a wonderful job in this movie.
522;I think that Tom Hanks can put this film at his top 5 best.
523;It will always be in my top 5 favorite films forever.
524;This is just one of those movies that you can watch every now and then.
525;It's become one of today's classics.
526;And it still entertains with its humor, love stories and friendships.
527;Tom Hanks turns in another remarkable performance, and Gary Sinise (CSI:NY) is another who puts in a good turn in front of the lens (as do many of the others.)
528;The movie combines it all, tears, laughter and the simple nature of trying to be kind which leads to rather remarkable situations.
529;I have seen it many times and still enjoy watching it.
530;tom Hanks does so well being Forrest Gump.
531;Forrest Gump is the best movie ever made.
532;Lt. Dan Was Another Best Friend Of Forrest's.
533;So Bubba Died During The War.
534;Forrest Gump Is A Great Movie To Watch With Your Kids And Family.
535;It Deserves Best Actor, Best Director, Best Motion Picture.
536;I'd call it a classic.
537;Forrest Gump is a prime example of how good acting can overcome a mediocre script and OK direction.
538;What is most impressive about Robert Zemeckis' direction is how CGI is utilized to integrate his characters into historical events.
539;What ingratiates you to this character is that he has a heart a mile wide.
540;The film also benefits from a superb supporting cast with Gary Sinise as the embittered Lt. Dan, Robin Wright as Jenny(though I thought it too much that she had to suffer so many indignities), Mykelti Williamson as Bubba, and Sally Field as Forrest's mother.
541;What I would add to that is the public took this character into their bosom.
542;Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie.
543;this has to be one of his best performances ever.
544;i love this movie and so will you.
545;This movie is a modern classic.
546;It's personal taste, but this is my absolute favorite movie of all time and I have watched it at least 20 times.
547;This movie points out that all people have something great to offer the world, regardless of their shortcomings.
548;I found it a bit too sentimental.
549;We saw it on our home PC using Amazon's movie streaming service, which worked quite well.
550;One of the best movies of all time.
551;I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it.
552;One of my favorites movies from Tom Hanks, if not his best.
553;Even though the movie is long it keeps you entertained.
554;A good movie that receives criticism from liberal baby.
555;boomers who realize what a bold assault the script makes against the values they hold dear and the immoral society they helped to create in this country.
556;culture of the 60's receive a well.
557;I salute any movie with the guts to make such a statement in the face of an ever.
558;I love Tom Hanks, and have seen him in all his films.
559;This is one of, if not THE, best.
560;And when a great actor does that.
561;the supporting roles are very engaging also and are well.
562;acted: I loved Sally Fields' mother.
563;Jenny is also spot on.
564;She got each decade just right.
565;i rank this as one of the top ten movies ever made.
566;important nostalgia is as shrewd as it is nefarious.
567;Tell people not to think, a la 1984, and they will resist.
568;Gently persuade them not to think by showing that you'll come out just fine if you follow orders, and you'll be much more successful.
569;Does that mean I want to see it?It's as impressive and cutting.
570;edge as Mr. Ed, the talking horse was in the '50s.
571;Zemeckis and Co. know that the demographic with the most disposable income are baby boomers, and that if there's anything they like, it's a film that affirms how wonderful their generation was.
572;BURN $20 to keep warm!
573;And this movie won AWARDS?
574;in the future, will this movie be seen as a back.
575;Sometimes it's the special needs child that teaches more than we could ever teach them and they do so with such innocence.
576;The soundtrack was great and watching Forrest go thru so many historical eras was a treat.
577;This is fiction, folks and about as good as it gets!
578;Imagine a simple minded (yet functional) man who sets out to be the best he can be!
579;exaggerated in ways but it is a darn fine film, one full of compassion and love and Tom Hanks has you cheering Forrest on from the very beginning.
580;Gary Sinese is absolutely wonderful as Lt. Dan in this film.
581;The way they were able to modify the old clips to get Forrest in on the action was great.
582;I thought this was a very, very good movie, full of hope and promise and is it wrong for anyone of us to dream?
583;Sit back, enjoy and remember, it's entertainment!
584;escapism, drama, comedy, a little action .
585;Made me remember what a great movie this is in so many ways.
586;it is soo simple and easy to watch without getting bored.
587;One of the best all time movies.
588;I love Tom Hanks and have wanted this movie for a long time.
589;Forrest Gump is a movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for 1994.
590;Forrest Gump is one of the best and most important movies of the 1990s.
591;Good thing, Robert Zemeckis won the Best Director Oscar.
592;The screen test are nice enough, if only because you get to see Tom Hanks playing Forrest before he had worked out the accent.
593;And the Zemeckis/Starket/Carter commentary, while lacking the fun and spontanaity of some I've heard, provides enough good tidbits and insights to keep you interested.
594;I guess if you really love Gump or absolutely need to know more about the effects, you'll really enjoy the disc.
595;Nice to be able to get the older movies.
596;This came in good condition and I received it quickly.
597;Well, I suppose that I will be going against a WALL of disagreement here, but I feel that FORREST GUMP is one of the most overrated movies I have seen in years.
598;warming, feel good movie for the masses.
599;ballyhooed special effects sequences, whereby our affable, developmentally.
600;When hearing how majestic this .
601;Fortunately, these films were something more than gushy, feel good flicks, such as FORREST GUMP .
602;And having it on Blu.
603;Forest Gump is one of the best yet.
604;it was very creative how at the beginning there was that one feather and then how at the end it came back to him.
605;One thing that made the movie bad was that he loved the same girl no matter what and how no matter how mean she was he still loved her just the same.
606;I am advising you to see it!
607;It's funny, sad, has action, and a story that flows smoothly.
608;No wonder it won many awards.
609;It's a pretty long movie, too.
610;riches story in such an unorthodox sense.
611;We loved the plot, the actors were just right for the parts they played, and all were very believable.
612;there are a lot of fantasy fulfillment movies like this.
613;They are so delighted to have see their fantasy come true they think that makes it a good movie.
614;At first it might feel good but eventually you know the person is lying.
615;Sort of like this film.
616;In other words they'll pander to you, give you what you want for money even if it's an absurd story.
617;I forgot how great it was.
618;This movie was truly inspiring to me.
619;average IQ's can be a success in life, and I'm one of them.
620;I can barely balance a checkbook and my I. q. is dull normal , but I can spell and type 120.140+ words per minute and I'm very successful in my career as a medical transcripionist.
621;Again, this is a wonderful movie that hubby and I like to watch over and over because it inspires us (we are also both epileptic).
622;It was fun watching him projected into the past historical pictures.
623;It's inspirational, emotional and educational.
624;It has both philosophic depth and is highly emotional.
625;One of Hank's best movies.
626;something everyone in the family can watch and enjoy.
627;How nice to watch a movie with good acting and dialogue instead of the obligatory special effects and sex scenes.
628;Special features that will take you a night to watch.
629;Although 2 great american classics.
630;if you have not seen it in a while,I recommend you re.
631;introduce yourself to this movie.
632;nice 5.1 audio mix as well.
633;"I don't usually care what the critics say about movies but in this case I agree with them and as result I feel ""Forrest Gump"" is one of the top movies of all time."
634;pong champion and a shrimping millionaire but the love of his life, Jenny, shuns him until the end of her life when her abuses catch up to her.
635;Sally Fields plays his Mother and is wonderful.
636;FG is a great blend of comedy, drama and sadness.
637;A marvelous achievement in film making.
638;They love the Shoes and suitcase with Chocolate.
639;Great move, we love it.
640;It's my husbands favorite and we will continue to watch it over and over!
641;Forrest Gump is a very special movie, a movie in which so many values, traditions, historical events and occurrences are all seen through the eyes of one man who is affected by all of the above mentioned aspects of life.
642;This man is the very embodiment of American innocence in a time when that innocence was fading from sight, with such events as the Vietnam War and segregation issues plaguing the country, and through his simple words and actions, we are able to appreciate the lives in which we live on a much more elevated level.
643;the film is a complex and stunning journey that involves many characters, all of whom represent a separate and unique stereotype of the 50's, 60's and 70's.
644;The events portrayed throughout the movie are handled with such meticulous detail and through the eyes of Forrest Gump, we see everything in a whole new light.
645;He will carry this love with him for the rest of his life, protecting her from her abusive father and staying by her side through their school years.
646;forrest stays in touch with her, even after he is drafted and sent to Vietnam to fight in the war.
647;There, he meets Bubba Blue, and they become fast friends due to their ostracization from the rest of the group's men.
648;Their commanding officer, Lieutenant Dan Taylor, is harsh and strict, so it comes as no surprise that when a battle goes terribly wrong, he loathes Gump for pulling him out instead of leaving him to die.
649;Forrest lives his life the way a child would that has been taught by his mother the values of life, and Forrest holds extremely true to those values, never breaching them for a second.
650;the movie also places Forrest in slight interaction with historical figures, ranging from John F. Kennedy's congratulating of the All.
651;american football team, to Richard Nixon's resignation from the White House.
652;Even though his involvement with these events is purely fictional, it offers much needed comical relief for such a serious film.
653;Jenny becomes the hippie, the rebel of society who does drugs and men, following what is considered cool even when it puts her in danger.
654;All of these characters give us diverse looks at the events at hand, while also providing an emotional outlet as we feel their pain and emotions.
655;tom Hanks gives his best and most memorable performance ever in this film.
656;He plays Gump with all the simple.
657;mindedness and naivety that the movie needs, and brings such vivid and emotional life to the movie.
658;We believe in his ability to create such beautiful images with his simple words.
659;Robin Wright plays his girl, Jenny, who has a profound effect on us despite her many mistakes in her life.
660;Throughout the movie, she seems to be wanting something more than just the popular scene and lifestyle, and Wright brings all of that out with vivacity and excellence.
661;Mykelti Williamson is Bubba Blue, who is a bit smarter than Forrest in terms of understanding the country's upsets.
662;And Sally Field plays Forrest's mother, sweet and charming, loving and warm.
663;Tom Hanks is an awesome actor.
664;It amazing how he acquired his wealth throughout the movie.
665;My favorite film has consistently been Forrest Gump.
666;It was the first film that I saw that really made me understand the importance of cinema in American culture.
667;also, though I didn't realize it at the time, it was beautifully made from the cinematography to the set design to the music, and perhaps most important, the acting and directing.
668;The acting in some of the scenes is monumental.
669;There are so many quotable lines.
670;The acting by so many of the supporting characters is so effective that you can take the characters' performance for granted and concentrate on the stories and themes.
671;Gary Sinese, Sally Field, and Hayley Joel Osment fit right into the story.
672;"I fell in love with FORREST GUMP (metaphorically speaking, of course) the first time I saw it in the theater
I:8439;673;I attribute this to the """"simplistic complexity"""" Tom Hanks brings to this unforgettable role."""
674;"Hanks brings all these attributes to vivid life in his portrayal
I:8439;675;set in the South, FORREST GUMP is also a powerful critique of America in the mid.20th Century.
I:8439;676;Some of the criticism is on the mark, some of it over the top.
I:8439;677;fORREST GUMP is an exceptional, well.
I:8439;678;made film that looks good and feels good.
I:8439;679;It sports a stellar supporting cast, including Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright Penn (to name but a few).
I:8439;680;But Hanks is the consistent forte"
681;Academy Award winner Tom Hanks, accompanied by Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn, delivers an emotional roller coaster of a performance in the 1994 Paramount Studio release directed by Robert Zemeckis titled Forrest Gump.
682;forrest Gump garnered six Academy Awards including Best Visual Effects, Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Tom Hanks.
683;They helped him meet Jenny, played by Robin Wright Penn, who provides many firsts for Forrest as they continue their friendship through the film.
684;The special effects that are used for the battle scenes and the brief encounters with President Kennedy, President Nixon, John Lennon, and into the middle of desegregation in the south provide for a humorous and light.
685;i give Forrest Gump a four and a half out of five stars for the special effects, the soundtrack, and the emotional content that each actor and actress is able to bring out in their characters.
686;This entire movie is a treat compared to the majority of stuff released around it.
687;A great family movie, great acting by Tom Hanks.
688;The movie was witty and very entertaining.
689;Sally Fields was also great and her supporting role.
690;Hadn't seen it for 20 years and loved every minute of it.
691;Our time was well spent watching and enjoying it.
692;This movie is masterfully crafted gentle satire with a huge heart .
693;funny, sad and some beautiful, magical moments.
694;Without that edge it might be considered by some to be too sentimental or silly, but it is carried out wonderfully.
695;the feather is a beautiful touch .
696;so we can wonder about the places it lands .
697;I have watched it several times and will watch it more.
698;This movie will get you to thinking about our lifestyles and the way our lives affect others.
699;Grab a soda and some chips and get into this movie you will enjoy it.
700;This is one of,I feel,the best films Tom Hanks has made over the years.
701;Loved it when it came out.
702;A timeless classic that captures the hearts of everyone.
703;The only bits I enjoyed were the scenes in Vietnam, and the special effects are pretty good.
704;I have seen it many times and love it more each time.
705;The story line is exceptional.
706;Amazon has some great deals and we figured we'd pick this up for our collection.
707;I think that the best movies are those that you 'appreciate' or understand after seeing it more than once.
708;it is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75.
709;but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war movies fail to do.
710;show the importance of world peace or what love movies can't deliver.
711;Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too).
712;what that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level.
713;And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.
714;every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks.
715;I love this movie and don't hesitate to give it a 10.
716;A brilliant performance and a great american story.
717;i think this movie belongs in the top 15.
718;Wanted to see it again.
719;well this is a classical movie that's been around for a long time.
720;It was good to watch when you want to see the underdog do something really spectacular.
721;I have watched this movie about a dozen times and it is always good.
722;it's a classic and really never gets old.
723;Best thing about it was being able to stream it free from Amazon Prime Videos.
724;If you're not a Prime customer, you should be, it's a great service.
725;Forest Gump is one of the all time great movies.
726;I think this isTom Hanks best film.
727;He was incredible in this movie!
728;In me it produced both joy and sorrow.
729;The characters are so real.
730;The story shows that every human being is of value.
731;The touch of humor adds a lot.
732;This movie was and IS a classic.
733;From the first moment to the last, this movie is touching, moving, action.
734;packed, humorous and just plain unbelievable.
735;I liked the extras and I loved watching the finished product.
736;It's a part that he was born to play.
737;And he played it to the hilt!I loved, loved, loved loved this movie!!!
738;This is my favorite movie as well.
739;Release it already, it's a classic.
740;But you do with this movie.
741;It is a classic I would stand by this rating!
742;The story is special but sound track is what makes the movie.
743;If you never watched Forrest Gump, you must watch it.
744;If you watched it in the past, watch it again.
745;Gary Sinise is also excellent.
746;I just loved all the actors.
747;They had the story of him and how he honors, respects and supports our wounded soldiers.
748;He truly shows us what respecting our soldiers means to everyone.
749;where does one begin to critique this amazing masterpiece of a film.
750;Tom Hanks is outstanding in his role and I challenge anyone to walk away from this movie before the final credits.
751;Always a classic, always enjoy it.
752;We catch new funny things each time.
753;It's one of the movies everyone should see.
754;I love the movie, it always brings tear to my eyes and a smile on my face when I watch it.
755;I recommend this movie to anyone.
756;This movie is a classic who, in their right mind, does not love Forrest Gump??
757;It is a must watch.
758;Aw I just about love this movie.
759;Forrest is slow in his mind, but he has a big heart.
760;I think he is one the most inspiring characters yet.
761;He shows the human vulnerabilities that we face in life, and triumphs over them with his heart.
762;I think the greatest thing about this movie, was that Forrest continued to live his life despite his love for Jenny.
763;He loved her with all his heart, but that didn't stop him from 'living'.
764;All the characters in the movie set the stage for Forrest.
765;Even though the movie had a religious tone it in it (not so absorbed in it), it sent a beautiful message nonetheless.
766;Tom Hanks performance as Forrest Gump is a tough character to beat with his great acting!
767;You will fall in love with his life story and his love for jen.
768;Everyone in your family will enjoy this movie!
769;I love this movie so much because I lived through all that.
770;Would someone please answer the question above?
771;Little things that add up to one big masterpiece.
772;witted man who triumphs works, of course, because of the performance of Tom Hanks.
773;They do that in this film, but I still make an exception because it took the character to new levels.
774;This move adds a lot of dimension to this by showing the feelings this man has.
775;but what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.
776;He ultimately triumphs because of his basic decency.
777;His determination to do the right thing, and stick with those he believes in gives him his ultimate rewards.
778;It is an enjoyable film that you will watch over and over.
779;But it is a very good film.
780;But a special man can accomplish anything.
781;This is an american classic that I had to get for my friend for her collection.
782;I recived it in a timely matter and the package and disc were in perfect condition
783;Forest Gump is a movie about a young man named Forest and he has a fair life with his mother.
784;He graduates from college and joins the army and marries Jenny.
785;It is fair to watch, but not great.
786;this not so common combination is what makes this film so great and recommended.
787;I can't forget his insane runs across the U. s. with all the nutcases joining him, this was brilliant !
788;Seeing this for the first time was a real blast.
789;this movie can be seen over and over ,yet the pleasure remains.
790;1994 featured the two most interesting central characters to ever grace the silver screen.
791;Both films from which the characters originate I consider to be in the top five best movies of all time and it's the actors that makes the characters come to life that makes the films so magnificent.
792;forrest Gump is a drama and a comedy.
793;underrated by audiences, Forrest Gump is simply an amazing film.
794;I was surprised by how hilarious and moving it was.
795;the performances are what make this film memorable.
796;Tom Hanks gives one of the best leading performances of the decade (and possibly of all time).
797;The supporting cast which consists of Wright Penn, Sally Field, Mykelti Williamson, and Haley Joel Osment (of Sixth Sense fame) also deliver good performances.
798;forrest Gump is a great film that has to be seen to be believed.
799;His journey is simply breathtaking.
800;Most people do, and for good reason.
801;love, humor, action, happiness, sadness, and everything in between.
802;"Despite interpretations to the contrary, it's not a movie pushing a message or driving an agenda
I:8439;803;Destined to be a classic for many years .
I:8439;804;for the price, this is a great package.
I:8439;805;This is a nice looking, crisp transfer of this modern classic that should look pretty good on high.
I:8439;806;The cinematography deserves the widescreen treatment.
I:8439;807;I certainly would have liked extras with more substance .
I:8439;808;but it's an enjoyable watch nonetheless.
I:8439;809;Think about it: Tom Hanks portrays a pure innocent who presumably is to be seen as an American Buddha .
I:8439;810;meanwhile, we are further manipulated by a soundtrack carefully assembled so as to have us associate all the good feelings and hopes connected to the songs with what we are watching: a phenomenal bit of film making that successfully transposes the audiences associations with the highest ideals of the sixties and seventies on a film that belittles commitments to those beliefs.
I:8439;811;this is a truly insidious, reactionary piece of work.
I:8439;812;At the end of the movie, """"Nashville,"""" Robert Altman cleverly decries the ease by which an audience can be seduced into acquiescing to feel."""
813;no one can deny that this movie is a well made film with some sweet and wonderful performances.
814;a successful attempt to bypass the audience's frontal lobe.
815;Just bought this as a gift for a friend.
816;I think what truly emanates from this movie is its presentation of the human condition from a glorious perspective, that of a guru's, guised as a simple man.
817;Alas, Forrest Gump's mental handicap is much more than an edge for characterization, it's a gift offered to the audience from which they can understand the world as Gump sees it.
818;Forrest Gump is a man way ahead of our time, and if we're lucky we can all see the world as he does.
819;if you dont already agree, watch the movie one more time, and keep these assertions in mind.
820;Not to worry, the French still love Jerry Lewis movies.
821;Forrest Gump is a classic movie.
822;It makes me laugh and cry, but it really is a heart touching movie about Forrest Gump going after his true love, Jenny.
823;Tom Hanks at his best, which is to say as good as it gets.
824;All of my children have watched it numerous times.
825;A classic for all time.
826;Maybe Tom Hank's greatest acting job of his career.
827;Your heart will jump with joy, cry with sorrow and have a bunch of laughs along the way.
828;This is one of the best movies ever !!
829;It's a must watch !
830;Tom Hanks does a great job.
831;A timeless classic that will around for years to come.
832;This movie is best experienced over and over.
833;That's all I have to say .
834;"After five years of playing football I got a college degree!"")"
835;yet he somehow manages to become a football star, a war hero, and a successful businessman.
836;the special effects in this one are absolutely amazing.
837;It's all totally first class stuff.
838;adventure addicts will love the war scenes (which were bloody, but not nauseating).
839;Comedy buffs will love Forrest's ability to be funny without meaning to.
840;History buffs will love figuring out what year it is by what events are going on at the time.
841;This movie has something for everyone!
842;One of the best movies I have watched.
843;It is the 4th time I watch it.
844;Probably will watch more times in the future.
845;Gary Sinise and Tom Hanks pull off their roles masterfully.
846;They are amazing in this tale of a man with a big heart who always seems to be in the right place at the right time with the right people.
847;if she's happy then that's all that matters.
848;There's a bit of everything in Forrest Gump.
849;I really believe the film is about going with your feelings and living a simple life.
850;Forrest Gump is pure magic, watch the movie.
851;A beautiful film, with complex emotions, deep and thoroughly engaging.
852;If you have, watch it again.
853;Forrest Gump is a timeless classic, and will touch your heart.
854;This one is really one of the best movie ever!!!!
855;The story is AMAZING, absolutely meaningful!!!!!
856;His innocence is heartwarming amidst all the turmoil around him in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.
857;This film is funny as well as touching, making it wonderful to watch.
858;deliered very timely at a good price.
859;This is one movie that deserved all the acclaim it got.
860;Forrest Gump is one of the most original ideas for a movie ever created.
861;It follows the unbelievable life of Forrest Gump and the humorous and heartbreaking journeys that he endures in war, love, and life.
862;Hanks is wonderful as the slow, but innocent Forrest and there are so many great and powerful moments in this movie.
863;I think it is so enduring because it is about the human experience, and we, as an audience, feel for Forrest as he must learn life and the problems life presents.
864;It is an experience that we all must go through, and I recommend this movie to anyone.
865;This film reminds me a lot of one of my other all.
866;"time favourite movies ""Being There"" starring the comedic genius Peter Sellers but it is even more than that as it incorporates themes present in the outlandish myths of the tales of Paul Bunyon stretching the imagination with amusing whoppers all done so expertly interweaving important social and political issues spanning the 50's to the 80's coinciding with the growth of one simpleton Forrest Gump from childhood to adulthood."
867;The screenplay is excellent but what makes this film work so well is how well it handles the other major aspects of film.
868;making such as sound effects, cinematography, lighting let alone the usual acting and directing that most people are familiar with.
869;If you look at this film from a purely technical aspect, this on all accounts is an excellent film and will certainly age very well over the years.
870;without being judgemental, this film manages to remind us of important historical events in a humourous manner also without being disrespectful of the subject matter.
871;There are many themes here but I liked the Lt Dan sub.
872;story the best about how a person finds redemption and peace with himself and his faith.
873;The overall theme which addresses the question of whether life is a series of chance occurrences or the work of an invisible hand I found to be very interesting and is what will make this film as timeless as the answer to this central theme of this great movie.
874;One of the best Tom Hanks movie!Although my copy came without the slipcover :(
875;Tom Hanks at his best in this journey through our country's recent past.
876;Set to a rockin soundtrack this film won many awards.
877;this gift is for a friend.
878;as we were talking about movies we've seen, he stated this was his favorite movie of all time.
879;the movie is long, but well worth the time to watch it
880;I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is.
881;it's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13.
882;We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally.
883;FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play.
884;Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love.
885;love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country.
886;Technically and visually, the film is a marvel.
887;The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time .
888;He is a decent and very good man.
889;There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar.
890;when I rewathed the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie.
891;And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump.
892;Hanks is brilliant as usual, and the screenplay and soundtrack capture the spirit of the times.
893;definitely worth watching more than once.
894;Forest Gump is the greatest movie ever made.
895;Having it at my disposal online is a nice addition to my collection.
896;I never know what to say is my favorite movie but I'm certain this is on my top five list.
897;Great movie it tell a lot about the past in a fun way.
898;Love the movie and order the sound track to complete the package.
899;filled with tragedy and triumph, Gump also meets Elvis Presley, John F Kennedy, George Wallace, John Lennon and Richard Nixon.
900;it is a movie about the triumph of the human spirit.
901;The thing i love the most about this film is forrest's down to earth and innocent personality.
902;it's hard to beleive this is just a film and it is greatly down to Tom Hanks's exceptionally performance which I think can sit comfortable amongst the best ever.
903;To me the music also plays a big part in the movie with classy tunes from the last 50 years.
904;my favorite scenes in this movie are when Forrest begins to run for no reason and when forrest is introduced to forrest junior.
905;Movie streamed perfectly no skips etc.
906;I will definitely look for other movies to view.
907;I'm a huge fan of Tom Hanks and this film in general.
908;Tom Hanks was great in it.
909;Forrest Gump is a classic, what else can I say.
910;Forrest Gump, based more or less on the novel of the same name by Winston Groom, is my second favorite film of all time.
911;It always manages to cheer me up, or make me laugh, or make me think.
912;Plus I love all the retro footage and sets, being a big fan of all things 1960s and 1970s.
913;His life leads him to all sorts of places, and he gets to meet all sorts of people, some of them celebrities of the day.
914;Whichever way, it certainly makes an interesting ride.
915;there are so many things I love about this film.
916;I love the character of Forrest, the way he looks at things, the way he talks and interacts with people.
917;I love the soundtrack, a mix of songs contemporary with Forrest's adventures in the 1960s and 1970s.
918;They really add to the mood of the film, plus usually are relevant lyrically, which is a nice touch, I thought.
919;I love the look of everything in the film, which helps the atmosphere just as much as the music.
920;I love how this movie can make me laugh, make my cry and make me think.
921;I love how there's always something thematically I haven't noticed before.
922;Though it's about a not so clever man, I do believe it's a very clever film.
923;since I love the film so much, I find the special features really interesting.
924;It's a great, colourful film with plenty to look at and consider.
925;tom Hanks is brilliant and he plays the part wonderfully.
926;This movie will have you laughing and crying at the same time.
927;Forrest goes on adventures, they are passably amusing.
928;Gimmie an Oscar, I rule the acting I do.
929;Chuck Klosterman summed up the problems with them pretty neatly and I'm gonna quote him as best I can from memory: 'Baby Boomers are convinced that they are the most important generation ever.
930;I wish I had the exact quote, but that's the gist of it, and he goes on to note how baby boomers are obsessed with how revolutionary they are and yet they inherited the establishment and ended up keeping pretty much everything the same.
931;I watch this one at least twice a year.
932;One of Tom Hanks best roles and the movie is full of laughs.
933;jenny was Forrest's true love.
934;She always believes in Forrest's future and ability and makes considerable sacrifices to ensure that her son recieves an appropriate education.
935;His best friend is Bubba.
936;Forrest Gump also features an early performance by Haley Joel Osment.
937;"Great movie, great actor
I:8439;938;One of the best movies I have ever seen, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys life stories, and a little romance!!!
I:8439;939;My children's enjoyed the movie, now it's their favorite movie of the year.
I:8439;940;Whether it was the dramatics, the dry humor, or the general time sequence of watching Forrest grow up, this movie is captivating on all accounts and then some.
I:8439;941;Definitely worthy of repeated viewings.
I:8439;942;This is an all time classic.
I:8439;943;This is a truely amazing and magical movie and most people wonder why.
I:8439;944;It makes you feel good inside.
I:8439;945;Forrest Gump makes his way into all of our hearts by weaving himself into real American events so that we can relate to him.
I:8439;946;An innocent man sitting on a bench telling the story of his life.
I:8439;947;The music adds to the film a lot, being timed in with what's going on.
I:8439;948;It tells the tale of a man's life, and how he changed America.
I:8439;949;Tom Hanks brings so much to the role of Forrest, being able to express many emotions and feelings.
I:8439;950;RUN!The first time my son watched this film he thought it was about a real dude!Very good movie and Tom Hanks' performance is first rate!
I:8439;951;Tom Hanks in one of his BEST performances.
I:8439;952;His life touches most of these significant ways, such as by accidentally discovering Watergate.
I:8439;953;He becomes famous after rescuing several soldiers in the Vietnam War, and achieving remarkable success in international ping pong.
I:8439;954;But his heart's desire is his childhood friend Jenny, who is one of the few who shows compassion to him.
I:8439;955;the insight into the life of a retarded man is wonderful.
I:8439;956;And the acting, particularly of Tom Hanks in acting Forrest Gump, is remarkable.
I:8439;957;Some of the special effects (eg the ping pong playing, the inclusion of Forrest Gump in real newscasts of US presidents, John Lennon, etc) are astounding.
I:8439;958;She seems to represent all the dangerous things of the sixties.3.
I:8439;959;Forrest partly triumphs by his character, but also the whims of fate (eg the success of his shrimping company is pure """"chance"""" after all other boats sink)."""
960;This is a strong theme in the movie, and a dangerous one.5.
961;Some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century are trivialized.
962;The fact that this was awarded the Best Picture in 1993 and received a bag.
963;load of Academy Awards just proves that it is indeed representative of modern thinking.
964;It's a sad reflection of modern American, and its popularity just confirms how accurate this portrait really is.
965;Watching that goofy bastage chase that girl Jenny was touching.
966;Forest Gump is a goofy fargain bastage that will keep you laughing.
967;Well, I guess it's nice to have a movie for all the rainbow and unicorn loving cat ladies to be in love with.
968;But when I watched it again, I found Tom Hanks has taught us how to be a good person in our life .
969;This movie give me inspiration.
970;It's best to just sit back and let yourself be entertained by this unique, wonderfully moving, yet at the same time, incredibly funny film!
971;"The visuals in this movie are fantastic, as is the supporting cast
I:8439;972;Mixed in with in an interesting journey through the events that make up Baby.
I:8439;973;boomer generation history, Forrest Gump is a movie about friendship, love,and loyalty.
I:8439;974;But most importantly, it is a movie about a man who, though mildly retarded, has a heart of gold and who manages to make a huge impact on everyone around him .
I:8439;975;And now, in the words of Forrest Gump,himself, that's all I have to say about that!
I:8439;976;The movie was just as good the second time around.
I:8439;977;Great movie, unlikely story of course.
I:8439;978;but that's the beauty of this movie.
I:8439;979;I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and still enjoy watching it over and over again.
I:8439;980;This is a movie I'd enjoyed pre.
I:8439;981;the movie was in very good shape and played just fine.
I:8439;982;witted Southerner reflects on his life and being partof historical moments.
I:8439;983;This is definitely one of Tom's bestand this 2.
I:8439;984;disc set has good picture and sound plus neatextras.
I:8439;985;Most people know the movie but this is the way to see it.
I:8439;986;i felt so good and relaxed watching this movie.
I:8439;987;A man so pure at heart.
I:8439;988;It's probably better than the film.
I:8439;989;Now I see why it's a classic.
I:8439;990;this is one of the best films I have ever seen, once I have a chance but did not finish it , should really watch it early
I:8439;991;I highly recommend this movie for fans of Tom Hanks and anyone alive in the twentieth century.
I:8439;992;Forrest Gump is a great movie, one of the classics in movie history, and one of the biggest box.
I:8439;993;For god sake, this movie offened a top preformer, Elvis, and said that he stole the hip swinging from a dumb kid with an IQ of 75.
I:8439;994;This is my all time favorite movie.
I:8439;995;This movie is for all the family, part of te history, good story, everyone enjoys it.
I:8439;996;Blue ray version is good.
I:8439;997;Tom Hanks is one of the most talented actors from my generation.
I:8439;998;I gave it my fourth watch and well, to say I'm gutted would be an understatement.
I:8439;999;Have I ever loved a movie character as much as that of Forrest Gump?
I:8439;1000;There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face.
I:8439;1001;It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness.
I:8439;1002;I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role.
I:8439;1003;It also manages to nail all emotions.
I:8439;1004;With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump.
I:8439;1005;The humor is compareable to the great Stan Laurel.
I:8439;1006;my favourite scenes from this film .
I:8439;1007;i criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too.
I:8439;1008;This, and American Beauty are the two best films I have ever seen.
I:8439;1009;I pray I watch a film I like almost 60% as much.
I:8439;1010;It was a very well done movie.
I:8439;1011;I liked the ways that they did the stunts.
I:8439;1012;It proves that they can overcome.
I:8439;1013;This movie was directed with excellence and is always entertaining to watch.
I:8439;1014;Tom Hanks best movie IMHO.
I:8439;1015;It's a great movie, and it looked good on my tv, I'm glad I could order it instantly and watch it.
I:8439;1016;Another great movie and one of my favorites.
I:8439;1017;As a HS English teacher, this movie is great to show the various ways that one can write.
I:8439;1018;I remember going to the drive.
I:8439;1019;in and the theatre to see this movie and even at the young age I was, I loved it.
I:8439;1020;I love the character's in the movie from Forrest, Jenny, Bubba, Lt. Dan, and Mama.
I:8439;1021;Forrest has a heart of gold and its nice to see a movie that the whole family can watch.
I:8439;1022;Awesome and great movie all around from start to finish it did not dissapoint highly recommended for people of any age
I:8439;1023;Last time when I watched the movie that was 10 years ago, today I watch it again and still found it very unique and encouraging the young generation.
I:8439;1024;And thanks to Hanks superb acting.
I:8439;1025;I loved the story very much!It's one of the best film I ever seen.
I:8439;1026;the actors act very well.
I:8439;1027;It tells us a lot about the American history too!I think what truly emanates from this movie is its presentation of the human condition from a glorious perspective, that of a guru's, guised as a simple man.
I:8439;1028;the music adds to the film a lot, being timed in with what's going on.
I:8439;1029;but what I like most about the movie is that Forrest ultimately triumphs, but not because of his physical skills, or the amazing coincidences of his life.
I:8439;1030;so I very enjoyed it and I highly recommended it!
I:8439;1031;This movie is NOT like a box of chocolates, you always know what you are going to get!
I:8439;1032;I honestly have this on my """"I could watch this movie everyday"""" list!"""
1033;This singular picture was a superb surprise in that time.
1034;Zemckis masterpiece turns around the life and times of an elemental man who lives according fundamental schemes but ignoring all the vices and prejudices, acts and shines in the universe of the double moral and accustomed pattern behavior, so typical in us.
1035;drama and humor share its right place in this jeweled and admirable artistic movie that has become in a cult movie in just eleven years.
1036;Love this movie, its nice and heart warming and great cast that came together great for the film.
1037;The movie is the story of his life from childhood to adulthood and his search for Jenny, the love of his life.
1038;The story itself is moving and entertaining to say the least.
1039;It's no wonder this film won Best Picture and Hanks deserved the Best Actor award as well.
1040;I love this movie, but I only have to complain about the way the package arrived.
1041;Great movie, even the second time around.
1042;Very moving story, with great actors and actresses.
1043;Run Forrest Run was my favorite line in the movie!
1044;He met many presidents, and many famous people.
1045;Forrest Gump was a wonderful movie with the great soundtrack put into the movie.
1046;I loved the movie Forrest Gump.
1047;He had some tough times but he also had some great times.
1048;He met many famous and great people like Elvis Presley, who is the King of Rock and Roll.
1049;The actor who played Forrest Gump was Tom Hanks who is a wonderful actor and is so amazingly awesome, was the best actor to act for the film Forrest Gump.
1050;Not only is he a great actor, but he lived the part of Forrest Gump.
1051;Forrest Gump and his best friend Bubba Blue were also in the Vietnam war, and Forrest saved everyone including Lieutenant Dan.
1052;So he did, and became highly successful in life.
1053;This movie is one of my favorites of all time.
1054;Tom Hanks is once again great.
1055;He has the ability to transform into many personalities.
1056;We have seen this movie a bunch of times, and it still rocks!
1057;It is in our top ten list for sure!
1058;one of the best in history.
1059;everyone should watch it, in this humanity.
1060;Loved this movie because it is about honestly,loyality and non judgement.
1061;so do yourself a favour and drop the ego and enjoy the masterful fantasy that is Forest Gump.
1062;This movie is freakin great.
1063;Still as funny and heart warming as I remember it.
1064;Maybe now I'll take advantage and watch other well known movies that I only know of because of their popularity/mainstreamness.
1065;BEST MOVIE EVER this is one of the best classics every one should see this wonderful touching film I promise you will love it !!
1066;time favorite films and in my opinion, one of the best made.
1067;Being a very young teen at the time (around 13), there were some things about the film that I missed or didn't quite understand, but I nevertheless loved it.
1068;As the years went by, I watched it several times and it got better and better.
1069;It's one of those timeless movies that should be put in a time capsule.
1070;"Forrest Gump was the winner of ""Best Film"" in 1994."
1071;Everyone at my junior high at the time loved the film and even voted it as their favorite for 1994.
1072;"For those of us like me, who never grew up in the 1950's and 60's, Forrest Gump"" is the perfect way to lead you through a decade of some of the most important events and people of that time."
1073;We see these events through the eyes and life of Forrest Gump, as this extraordinary man seems to come across some pretty historical marks just by living his innocent life.
1074;Tom Hanks (one of the best actors you could watch and one of my all.
1075;Together, they grew up and even though they led separate lives, they still remained close and had a good relationship.
1076;Jenny (a stunning performance from Robin Wright) meanwhile, has become a bit of a drifter and a druggie, hanging around with the likes of hippies and men who enjoy beating women.
1077;And keep your eyes open for a very young Haily.
1078;Forrest Gump is both a comedy and a drama.
1079;It's a story of heroism and loyalty, of love and acceptance, of trial and error.
1080;There is so much going on in this film that I could write a novel about it.
1081;"It covers so much ground
I:8439;1082;And the acting is so real, you feel like you're in the film.
I:8439;1083;It is a great """"period"""" film, as you can see all the styles from the times"
1084;Everything is captured so nicely.
1085;And the film has extraordinary special effects that involve real footage from the time period wrapped around Tom Hanks as Gump.
1086;"You can see how all the special features were done on the second disc ""Behind the Magic of Forrest Gump
I:8439;1087;There are awesome tunes from the war period of the sixties such as """"Turn!"""
1088;Can't speak enough of this great film with all the trimmings you could want.
1089;Director Robert Zemeckis is brilliant!
1090;This is one of my son's favorite movie's.
1091;the movie is a classic and the whole family can enjoy watching it.
1092;This came in so quick I'm so happy my boyfriend been asking for this movie for so long he's going to be so excited and surprised:))

1099;I personally enjoy the movie for the history lessons within the movie helps me remeber what happened in the past and being a history major in college I enjoy mutiple history lessons and topics.
1100;But every actor did a great job in the movie and made the movie so much more believable.
1101;This is an interesting way to review history.
1102;Should you be like Forrest Gump and do everything the authorities tell you to do?Forrest Gump is destined to become an American movie classic and the one which Tom Hanks will be remembered for.
1103;Forrest Gump is dumb, yet he is extraordinarily persistent and virtuous.
1104;His character strengths allows him to achieve extraordinary deeds, such as becoming a world class ping pong player, a famous marathon runner, and a war hero.
1105;the antithesis of Forrest is an intelligent Berkley anti.
1106;He also beats his girlfriend and is the antagonist of the movie.
1107;Blind submission to authorities will often lead to demise of the freedom and democracy in the society.
1108;Just read what the Founding Fathers of this great country had to say about the subject.
1109;american movie with a sinister theme.
1110;Service wonderful, came right on time.
1111;great for the family entertainment everyone enjoyed it and it made Christmas a perfect holiday
1112;I really enjoyed this film from start to finish and there was no slow parts that draged on the whole movie was great.
1113;The acting is great from Tom Hanks(oscar winning role) as Forest Gump, Robin Wright Penn as Jenny Forest's only one true love and then there is Gary Sinise who dose a great job and is a scene steller.

1122;This is a great story of ones life.
1123;He finds himself in Washington, D. c., the ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances.
1124;I later developed an affection for Tom Hanks' character when I went to D. c. with my son.
1125;A good movie on several levels.
1126;sympathy for the underdog, compassion for the mentally retarded, suspense.
1127;These factors are perennial, and I enjoy the fim every time I see it.
1128;WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!Forrest Gump is a movie that is held dearly in the hearts of audiences.
1129;It has won six Oscars, and has also claimed 38 other wins as well as 44 various nominations.
1130;Forrest Gump is an endearing story that follows the life of a man with a low IQ as he goes through a series of random of events.
1131;The movie's spans over several decades of Gump's life as the audience are also able to catch a glimpse of some of the defining moments of the latter part of the 20th century such as the Vietnam War.

1134;While at home, Jenny returns back into Forrest's life and promptly leaves after he declares his love for her.
1135;There is no doubt that this may be his best performance.
1136;Hanks not only personifies Forrest, he embodies the character, becoming one with him.
1137;He creates depth for a character that on paper is so simple.
1138;He makes Forrest lovable and extremely believable.
1139;He is able to portray this simple.
1140;"According to Peter Travers of the Rolling Stones, ""It's Hanks who brings humor and unforced humanity to the literary conceit of Forrest, though the slim actor scarcely resembles the 6."
1141;With no doubt, Tom Hanks is the shining star of this film as ability to portray such a character with such grace is equally astounding and worthy of applause.
1142;As is required, Wright definitely exudes the strength and the resilience that the role requires.
1143;Wright's performance delivers what is necessary to portray the character, but it is definitely not the dazzling display that Hanks has appeared to give.
1144;historical AccuracyForrest Gump is not only a movie with a great plot, within it, great history woven within.
1145;Set in the latter part of the 20th Century, Forrest Gump is able to give audiences a glimpse into the historical events of the time with surprising accuracy.
1146;one of the first historical events to occur is the integration of races in schools all across America.
1147;a big chunk of Forrest Gump is actually dedicated to the Vietnam War.
1148;While some of the events in both the movie and book are exaggerated, it is true that the ping.
1149;overall, Forrest Gump is great story, woven in with some of America's greatest historical events.
1150;"According Todd McCarthy of Variety, ""A picaresque story of a simpleton's charmed odyssey through 30 years of tumultuous American history, Forrest Gump is whimsy with a strong cultural spine."""
1151;For those hoping to watch an exciting and humorous movie intertwined with history, Forrest Gump is the movie for you.
1152;The movie Forrest Gump is a wonderful story.
1153;The actors are excellent, and the story has something we can all learn: Work hard, do your best, and don't worry about what other people think about you.
1154;Because I love this movie.

1157;This is a great find.
1158;What an awesome movie for Tom Hanks.
1159;This is a movie you can watch over over again.
1160;Bubba was one of my favorite characters, his lip sticking out was hilarious.
1161;It does have a couple scenes that are not appropiate for younger ones but for the right age, this is an instant family classic!!
1162;Worthy of best picture of the year 1994.
1163;Gary sinise and the support cast were absolutely fantastic.
1164;Tom Hanks brings this character to life with great acting and great believability.
1165;The story is great and theere are many modern days stars in this movie.
1166;Many strong, emotional moments in this movie.
1167;A great movie to sit and watch, you may want a box of tissue by your side.
1168;Just watched this movie for the second time after nearly twenty years and was reminded how good this movie really is,
1169;And it remains one of the best of all time.
1170;There are so many extra features you won't know what to do.
1171;Loaded with documentaries, pictures, behind.
1172;scenes featurettes and even the screen tests for the actors, you will be entertained for hours after enjoying one of the greatest pictures ever made.
1173;Then, you will be able to continue the expereince by learning more about the film through all of the extra features it includes.
1174;His girlfriend, Jenny, reminded me of that woman in Of Human Bondage.
1175;There are interesting historical events woven into this story and the sequences of the fighting in the Viet Nam war were engaging.
1176;I remember sitting there, watching it, and really being incredibly moved.
1177;Well, this was the first movie I ever shed a tear in.
1178;It is definitely one of the greatest pieces of work Tom Hanks has ever done, and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time.
1179;Thijs is a fun sad happy uplifting movie that you will never get tired of watching.
1180;Do yourself a favor and see this one again.
1181;Bought this for my sixteen year old and she loves it.
1182;Several scenes have become American film classics, emblazed in our consciousness.
1183;"Also in praise, Tom Hanks does a fine job as Forrest, who embodies many of the qualities most prized in the United States
I:8439;1184;There is, however, a seamy underside to the movie and it is this message: it is better to be a half wit, oblivious to the vagaries of reality"
1185;her turbulence matches that of the political period.
1186;perhaps chastity and innocence engender honesty, loyalty, courage, and the ability to be remarkable.
1187;I laughed and I cried.
1188;Beautiful, and Tom Hanks, you're the man.
1189;Thank you for bringing Forrest to life.
1190;the only reason i gave it 2 stars was the splicing of actual footage from JFK, Nixon etc. and integrating them as part of the film which was funny at times.
1191;"If you think about it honestly, among serious movies, Forrest Gump"" is one of the dumbest ever made."
1192;Now imagine this sensitive artist's heart breaking because no one is listening to her music.
1193;"That scene in a nutshell captures the mentality of the film
I:8439;1194;Like the comedy that throws non.
I:8439;1195;now to give the devil his due: you will enjoy this movie in spite of how dumb it is.
I:8439;1196;Gump is a sympathetic character whom you will want to see succeed.
I:8439;1197;The film is fairly funny.
I:8439;1198;Which brings up an interesting point: what is the point of this movie?
I:8439;1199;I've spoken with several people who find that very inspiring.
I:8439;1200;this is NOT one of the best movies ever.
I:8439;1201;Forrest Gump, a mentally challenged man, ends up inadvertently causing many of the famous events in the sixties, but despite the fame and the riches he gains, the only thing that matters to him is winning the love of his childhood sweetheart, Jenny.
I:8439;1202;This has always been one of my favorite movies, charting a course through post.
I:8439;1203;wWII American history and showing how a simple man with a solid heart and strong values can be an example for millions.
I:8439;1204;ray made it all the more special
I:8439;1205;Once in a great while, a movie comes along that captures your heart and imagination.
I:8439;1206;Forrest Gump is one of those rare movies.
I:8439;1207;through three turbulent decades, the movie describes events that were capturing headlines throughout the United States, as told through Forrest's eyes.
I:8439;1208;the viewer also gets to see the ups and downs of Forrest's relationship with Jenny over the years.
I:8439;1209;the scenes in Vietnam are some of my favorites.
I:8439;1210;Gary Sinese's portrayal of Lt. Dan Taylor is simply perfect.
I:8439;1211;It is here that Lt. Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life.
I:8439;1212;the most touching scene of the movie is near the end where Forrest is speaking to Jenny at her gravesite.
I:8439;1213;He also explains to her how proud he is of their son Forrest Jr.
I:8439;1214;Tom Hanks won an academy award for his portrayal of Forrest, while Robert Zemeckis also won for best director.
I:8439;1215;Simply put, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8439;1216;The acting is impeccable, and the viewer gets an interesting history lesson about life in the United States during the 60s, 70s, and early 80s.
I:8439;1217;I give this film my highest recommendation.
I:8439;1218;Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is endearing, interesting, and amusing.
I:8439;1219;Watching Forrest go through life, inadvertantly participating in and making history, makes for a wonderful story.
I:8439;1220;Sally Field, Robin Wright, and Gary Sinese also give great performances.
I:8439;1221;the second disk of features is a real treat.
I:8439;1222;The FX are a big part of what makes this movie so memorable, and getting to see how they were created is fascinating.
I:8439;1223;Tom Hanks best role ever.
I:8439;1224;Entertaining, funny and a great love story.
I:8439;1225;I love the way the the movie pulls Forrest into pieces of historical events of the time period.
I:8439;1226;Heartwarming and good for the family (not small children).
I:8439;1227;A fantastic and sweet story of telling one's life.
I:8439;1228;Tom Hanks was great in this.
I:8439;1229;A man's journey in life explained with both tears of sorrow and joy, it's an instant classic in my book.
I:8439;1230;This is just a classic story.
I:8439;1231;Not only that, the soundtrack is phenomenal.
I:8439;1232;My husband is hearing impaired and needs subtitles in order to hear everything in the movie.
I:8439;1233;i love this movie each and every time i see it.
I:8439;1234;The box is awesome, the book is amazing, the scratch and sniff chocolates are sweet, but the feather inside makes no sense.
I:8439;1235;Timeless movie with a great cast and plenty of heartfelt moments and humor.
I:8439;1236;This movie was great, priceless all time movie that everyone should watch!
I:8439;1237;Such wisdom, because it represents the sponaneoity and mystery of life.
I:8439;1238;Sure, he's simpleminded, but he has a huge heart.
I:8439;1239;He is never mean, stands up for the people he loves, has more determination than any one I've ever seen.
I:8439;1240;He has such love, and he doesn't hold it all in.
I:8439;1241;He is honest, but not insulting.
I:8439;1242;There are more than enough scenes to show that Forrest is a rare spirit.
I:8439;1243;And he's so modest about it, too.
I:8439;1244;He is also overcome by compassion and love for his best friend, Jenny.
I:8439;1245;He just keeps on thinking about her and loving her.
I:8439;1246;forrest, a simple minded man, with an I. q. of 75, holds the key to all noble, shining parts of life.
I:8439;1247;I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and a love for simple, but memorable messages of life.
I:8439;1248;It's his favorite movie so he was pleased.
I:8439;1249;I really enjoyed getting to watch it again!
I:8439;1250;When I say greatest of all.
I:8439;1251;For those who dont think it is the greatest it has to rank in the top 10 right?
I:8439;1252;Well to me this is a pure cinematic masterpiece in every aspect, from the great cast(Hanks, Fields, Wright, Sinise), the great storyline, the camera work and great directing from Robert Zimeckis.
I:8439;1253;We see the progression from the young Forrest who barely makes it into a normal school and is constantly bullied by his peers, to the man who had come to experience so much in life like being on a national champion football team, meeting the president, serving in Vietnam and starting his own shrimping business.
I:8439;1254;Bubba was his best friend in the world, and they planned on a partnership in the shrimping business since Bubba's family had always been in that business.
I:8439;1255;Forrest lives life to the fullest and I think it is a great message because someone may be considered to be slow but that doesnt mean they can't accomplish so many things in life.
I:8439;1256;The extras are very good like the commentaries and deleted scenes, but to be honest I have not watched all that disc 2 has to offer.
I:8439;1257;And if you have never seen it, I really think you will be amazed at what a great film this is.
I:8439;1258;This is a great price for those who don't own this yet so do yourself a favor and pick this up if you havent already.
I:8439;1259;It is truly the best movie I have ever seen and I can't imagine anything else like it ever happening in cinema.
I:8439;1260;It is my favorite and I doubt anything will ever take its place.
I:8439;1261;I can watch this over and over again I love I take it everywhere with me if you've never seen it watch it and you'll never stop
I:8439;1262;Watching it today on TV it is still timeless, and can still almost quote it line by line.
I:8439;1263;Tom hanks does a great job performing the role of Forrest Gump.
I:8439;1264;The movie is a instant classic .
I:8439;1265;The art of the box is really good, have some parts with hologram effects.
I:8439;1266;I've watched Forrest Gump for the first time since its initial theatrical release and was quickly reminded just how great a film it really is.
I:8439;1267;There are a few extended moments of dead air, but for the most part she offers information about characters, their development and the subtle visual and verbal cues used to convey that growth.
I:8439;1268;An extended section on visual effects is the centerpiece of the second disc and includes some unfinished deleted scenes and disections that are very informative and entertaining.
I:8439;1269;And that's all I have to say about that.
I:8439;1270;One of the best ever made.
I:8439;1271;good"""" material, didn't see the movie."""
1272;If forest was real picture how the world would be.
1273;While it's not all true it's still an great watch.
1274;Best of my life How much longer do I have to say this that is so important to you?
1275;this is probably the best film I have ever seen.
1276;the most Profound element in this film you will recognize as soon as it's on the screen.
1277;and I think that is the whole point of this timeless CLASSIC.
1278;It is a very good movie.
1279;well produced and Tom was fantastic in it.
1280;GREAT MOVIE, full of comedy with some Drama through his life experiences.
1281;Good thing about this movie IS.you KNOW you will get some wonderful entertainment .
1282;This movie is amazing, but the package was a little damaged.
1283;First off, an incredible love story with greatimagination and depth.
1284;a touching courageous film for the entire family.
1285;Except unlike Airplane, Forrest Gump combines its humor with real drama and moral statements.
1286;Every individual scene is a whole movie and moral in and of itself .
1287;hit based on Winston Groom's novel that remains both a well loved and widely misunderstood film.
1288;"witted (perhaps mildly retarded) southern boy with ""crooked legs"" who has two great gifts ."
1289;the first is always looking for the good in any situation or in any person he meets, and the second is the ability to so totally focus on the task at hand that he completely immerses himself into whatever he takes on.
1290;The computer generated newsreel footage that splices Gump into so many archived moments is worth seeing this film for, but the gentle humor and poignant story of a love that endures great divides of time and distance make it an awesome experience.
1291;both Robert Zemeckis (Best Director) and Tom Hanks (Best Actor) won Academy Awards for this film, which I still think is one of the most powerful movies of our time.
1292;He meets JFK, wins the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, and manages to accidentally start the Watergate investigation.
1293;I think the reason for this is that we live in quite a cynical world and the majority of people do not really warm to lead characters that are innocent and pure of heart.
1294;People who watch this film should check their cynicism at the door and just enjoy a film that is about the everyman battling the world using only truth and a deep.
1295;seated sense of what he believes is right.
1296;After all, this film has a noble tradition, it follows in the footsteps of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's A Wonderful Life.
1297;One of the greatest movies in History, Forrest Gump is the story of a slow man from Alabama who winds up in all kinds of historic and amazing events and to him, its no big deal.
1298;Hanks is the standout throughout and this Academy Award winning performance put him in the same class as Jimmy Stewart and Marlon Brando as one of the greatest actors of this or any other generation.
1299;I'm giving this movie two stars because of the supporting actors, and, the book from which the movie is taken.
1300;tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and, seems like a nice guy, but, he needs to figure out what movies he is 'right' for, and, which ones he should turn down.
1301;they do spot on southern accents.
1302;He's quite gifted to have written them and Forrest Gump also.
1303;Classic, everyone should see this movie at least once in their lifetime, if you watch it once you'll watch it again.
1304;Forrest Gump (1994) is a classic, iconic American movie I think will live on.
1305;Much of the early movie is comic.
1306;through a groundbreaking process we see Forrest's image merged with the real images on newsreel footage of the American presidents he meets.
1307;He's loving, extremely loyal, kind, gentle, nave, trusting, courageous, and a lot smarter about life than most of the people around him.
1308;tom Hanks, the quintessential American movie star of the last thirty years, does a fantastic job as Forrest.
1309;He and his mother (Sally Fields) have a deep connection, and he has one love in his life, his childhood sweetheart, Jennie.
1310;She's a sixties love child who deeply disappoints Forrest by becoming part of the 60's and 70's drug culture, but their love triumphs.
1311;He also saves Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who eventually becomes his business partner and life.
1312;He goes into Bubba's shrimp business after the Vietnam War, and he becomes successful along with Lieutenant Dan.
1313;It's been many years since I first saw this in a movie theater, but I still watch it every so often.
1314;The incidents in his life are history, spanning the most dynamic years of the American century.
1315;Truly, truly an epic American film classic.
1316;It goes along side films like Braveheart and The Green Mile as one of the greatest films of the 90's.
1317;This film took some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century and trivialized them.
1318;Well, Robert Zemeckis ( Director of Roger Rabbit) has created acompelling, tear.
1319;inducing yet funny movie about the life of asimple southern man and his amazing life.
1320;The reason this movie achieved its reputation as one of the greats is because it portrays life's most beautiful qualities: innocent love, acceptance and value of others, and loyalty.
1321;These are qualities rarely found in our jaded world, but deeply longed for by us all.
1322;The movie is about the legitimate and profound power of optimism, persistence and character.
1323;Those themes are timeless and probably expressed better in this film than any other of the last twenty years.
1324;I just got to opening it.
1325;The film, designed to appeal to the Rush Limbaugh crowd, implies that dumb is good.
1326;Jenni, Forrest's on again off again girlfriend, represents all the evils of the '60s, while Forrest represents all that is good and true.
1327;what a clever binary opposition.
1328;Forest Gump will undoubtedly become one of the Eternal movies that generations will be able to enjoy and love.
1329;If you haven't seen this movie, well you are missing a master piece.
1330;It's got history, great music and lots of tears and laughs.
1331;This is a great great film.
1332;the acting is superb and the special effects(although very simple)are wonderful.
1333;its amazing how forrest managed to talk to Richard nixon,JFK and John lennon and they look exactly like they did at the time.
1334;"based story that you can watch and be like ""oh, I can see how that could happen""."
1335;the simple fact of the matter is if you loved Mean Streets (the Scorsese film that pre.
1336;I personally wasn't able to watch the majority of Mean Streets, so I think it makes sense that I liked this film.
1337;The visuals are creative and lushious, and the story brings to mind a gigantic field of flowers.
1338;He simply recognizes good screenwriting when he sees it.
1339;While many will give this movie 5 stars and critics and movie goers alike loved this movie, I will give you an honest opinion that differs.
1340;the visual effects are excellent and were state of the art at the time of the films release in 1994.
1341;It is anything but a feel good movie.
1342;This movie sends the message the opposite of what's really important.
1343;Forrest becomes rich in materialism and noteriety but is he really rich in spirit and personal life when everyone he cares about is gone?
1344;Afterall she could never give her love to Forrest his entire life, even though he offered unconditional love to her, but only when she is dying and needs her son to be raised by someone she knows is dependable does she give her love and self to Forrest.
1345;In closing for this review then I'll give some advice based on my experience.
1346;I love how Tom Hanks makes this film work.
1347;the Director maintained great pacing.
1348;im sure you will enjoy it.
1349;In this day of anything goes is refreshing to see a story, albeit somewhat fantastic and at times embarrassingly comedic, of an uncompromising, single minded, honest to an extreme, unselfish man, who is always true to his convictions no matter the consequences.
1350;A pure soul who in doing good to others transforms disasters into success for those around him as he for ever pursues an impossible childhood love.
1351;It one of my favorite movies.
1352;I would recommend it to everyone.
1353;When I first saw this movie, I was moved.
1354;it was funny and sad.
1355;I felt that Tom Hanks' performance was one of the best I'd seen.
1356;i still enjoy the sequence where Forrest runs across America several times.
1357;these things are no longer amusing.
1358;"A look at the ""baby boomers"" generation performed by the new Jimmy Stewart
I:8439;1359;This movie is one I would watch many, many times"
1360;I am amazed at the many talents of Tom Hanks and thebetter he gets as his career continues.
1361;Sure, Tom Hanks gives a noble performance, and his one liners rank with other classics from the world of film, but this sweeping tale is way too ludicrous to be believed.
1362;Certain scenes are astounding acheivements .
1363;especially the editing of monumental historical moments that put Forrest front and center.
1364;Personally, I found it in Sally Field's performance as Gump's mother, and in Gary Sinise's terrific Oscar.
1365;worthy moments as his platoon leader.
1366;One of the best movies I have ever seen, great learning to all of us, many things we feel were forgotten have been magically risen with this movie.
1367;Very heartwarming, entertaining, sometimes graphic( the Vietnam War scene) with a killer soundtrack of 1960s music to boot!
1368;The special effects of dropping Forrest into situations with key historical figures is amazing for the time this was made(1994)!
1369;I recommend it to anyone else who hasn't seen it yet!
1370;very sentimental and some decent special effects.
1371;Forrest Gump is one of the most relateable characters in the history of film.
1372;His good nature takes him on many adventures and eventually leads him to find happiness in the most unlikely places.
1373;Tom Hanks is marvelous in the role, and the colorful character is complimented by Robin Wright as Jenny, Forrest's life long love, Sally Fields as Forrest's Mama who always had a way of explaining things so that I (Forrest) could understand them , and Gary Sinise as the legless Lt. Dan.
1374;Production featurettes and behind the scenes footage combined with sound design, visual effect detail (Lt. Dan's legs were quite interesting!)
1375;, and screen tests were quite impressive and satisfying.
1376;I absolutely love this movie one of my very favorites.
1377;Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor.
1378;This is probably Tom Hanks' best piece of work to date.
1379;there are other that are good, but is a masterpiece.
1380;I was never able to view the movie.
1381;It was so good to watch this wonderful movie after a long time.
1382;Lot of good memories came back to my mind
1383;The story is just amazing.
1384;This is my favorite movie and will continue to be unless they make a Forrest Gump 2, which I think they should do.
1385;They should have begun making this movie by now but I guess they just want to leave Forrest Gump rest as one of the best movies of all times.
1386;I saw this movie several times and I always wanted to get it.
1387;Our son, loved the movie and my wife and I admitted we had forgotten what a great movie it is.
1388;tom Hanks is at his best, which is saying something.
1389;The movie is sweet, but not syrupy.
1390;If, like us, you saw the movie several years ago, you owe it to the movie to see it again.
1391;old and he loved it!
1392;The rest of it was fine And a great movie for all ages!
1393;In my opinion a true classic of the 90's and the crown jewel of what I would personally label as the American Magic Realism.
1394;sense story is perfectly seamed in a fluid, consistent realistic narrative.
1395;Maybe I was lucky, but in this particular case, I have to report a perfect broadcast.
1396;that makes it proof positive once and for all that all the craftsmanship in the world can't make a good movie out of an insipid premise.
1397;Tom Hanks is a superb actor!!
1398;Funny scenes, one right after the other, with a very tender and moving ending.
1399;Gary Sinise also gives a wonderful performance.
1400;Tom Hanks is at his best as usual.
1401;Captures great events as they happened back then.
1402;This really is an excellent movie but I gave it only 4 stars since it said the aspect ratio was 1:33: to 1 which is a full screen movie.
1403;It will be watched though since we do have a wide screen TV and my husband I am sure will enjoy it.
1404;"forrest Gump is an outstanding movie
I:8439;1405;i recommend this movie to everyone.
I:8439;1406;Forrest Gump is rated PG13"
1407;Forest gump is a great movie, with a great story.
1408;It made me laugh from the beginning to the end.
1409;Those two fargain ice oles are a dynamic duo in comedy.
1410;Man, this movie is so rich with emotions.
1411;this movie speaks a lot of truth, financially, spiritually, philosophically.
1412;This movie is a classic and there is not much else to say.
1413;I have always loved it and the easy access just makes it that much better.
1414;And this is definitely a good movie, probably the best movie of the 1990's.
1415;Only just watched in full on TV on Friday and wow, best movie i have ever seen.
1416;This has to be the best role Hanks ever played and Zemeckis' greatist film.
1417;great story of America and its south.
1418;a record of the way it used to be.
1419;and fun to watch too.
1420;I love how they used the special effects to make Forrest meet some famous people of the past.
1421;overall I thought the story was touching, well.
1422;Every actor was perfect for the role they played, especially loved Tom Hanks as Forrest and Sally Field as his mother.
1423;Well worth the money, IMHO!
1424;It's a movie that takes you on a journey through a young man's life and what challenges he goes through.
1425;There's a great mix of comedy and drama and you definitely connect with the characters.
1426;Tom Hanks and Sally Field do a wonderful job.
1427;a must see for everyone!
1428;Thisis my favourite film, and its very easy to say that!
1429;very touching and cleverly made.
1430;The great thing about this film is the realisation that he is not a very clever guy, and at the start of the film he would seem strange and pathetic, but at the end of the film you will realise that he is an incredible kind, tough and deep man.
1431;This is amazing the acting is spot on with a great albanian accent from Hanks no other actor could suit the role better than him.
1432;this film is the best ever you really do need this.
1433;Classic movie that is worth watching more than one time.
1434;Our whole family enjoys this movie it just makes you feel good .
1435;such a strong male role model preformed my tom hanks in an unlikely soul as forrest gump is childlike and disciplined in his simple yet complex life story.
1436;This is a classic movie that can be enjoyed by most age groups can be watched several times without becoming tiresome.
1437;The movie arrived on time and in excellent condition.
1438;Great acting and great story.
1439;Instead of going into a crazy busy store i just got it here.
1440;This was the best thing i could have done.
1441;I will continue to do my christmas shopping here.
1442;Saving Private Ryan is my favorite, and Apollo 13 is my third favorite.
1443;It is always good to watch this movie and get inspired and laugh.
1444;tom hanks does a great job in this movie in great shape and love the movie i know in time it will be a classic
1445;Grew up and still live in Savannah, Georgia.
1446;It's great to see my hometown showing off her beauty on the big screen!
1447;Forrest Gump is a film that contains a perfect amount of drama and comedy.
1448;The movie stars Tom Hanks who does a fantastic job as Forrest Gump and wins the audiences heart by playing a not so smart but loveable man.
1449;There are historical events that Forrest takes part of that gives the audience a good laugh with the twist that is added to the events.
1450;Even though Forrest might not be the smartest apple of the bunch with the way he talks but the audience learns how inside he has a good heart and teaches others that everyone has good within them even rough people like Lieutenant Dan.
1451;If you like a movie that gives you a laugh and a character who wins your heart Forrest Gump is the movie for you.
1452;will watch again and again and share with our friends.
1453;I love this movie, always have.
1454;Tom Hanks is just amazing.
1455;'Forrest Gump' is undeniably a groundbreaking movie, well deserving of its Oscar wins.
1456;This is quite possibly one of my favorite movies of all time.
1457;haForrest, played BRILLIANTLY might I add by one of the most influential actors of our time (HANKS), can be described as gentle, warm and sincere.
1458;He, despite his mental incapabilities, is what all of us truly desire to one day become.
1459;notable actors in the movie include Sally Field (love her!)
1460;the soundtrack and score to this film is amaaaazing.
1461;Definitely check that ish out if you're into classic rock or music general.
1462;Although it sounds cheesy and completely pathetic, it truly will lift one's spirits in terms of realizing the simplicity of life and all it has to offer.
1463;The movie plays as you eat and the staff asks you movie trivia, it was a fun time for all.
1464;Too bad most people with that wonderful spirit are compromised.
1465;Very entertaining, the humor is ingenous in a good way, well crafted story, simple and marvellous.5 stars for sure!!!
1466;I love this film and just had to get the Blu.
1467;It looks crisp and clean as you would expect, but for some strange reason, the rock music soundtrack has vanished.
1468;It came out when I was 5 and I still love it and quote it today!
1469;my favorite actor in this movie is gary sinise.
1470;he was so funny in this movie and tom hanks was funny too.
1471;i like tom hanks and gary sinise in this movie they both made this movie funny.
1472;Favorite movie of all time.
1473;This is the best most awesome movie I've ever watched.
1474;Just go through life in a haze and you'll achieve more than the guy who spent his life learning and working hard.
1475;Watch some real films by Uwe Boll if you want to be entertained.
1476;Completely entertaining, compelling and mesmerizing.
1477;This is a classic movie and even though it is a movie, it shows kids that anything is possible, you just have to try !!!!
1478;This is one of my favorite movies ever !
1479;I would recommend this movie to everyone and anyone.
1480;This was a very good movie.
1481;it made you feel joyful.
1482;Tom Hank's best performance yet!
1483;I saw this movie when I was 11, and remember it being one of the first films I knew was actually genius.
1484;One of Robin Wright's 2 breakthrough performances (along with Princess Bride) and another of Hank's Oscar winning roles (greatly deserved).
1485;Highlights include 2 commentarys, audition footage of a 5 year old Haley Joel Osment, a documentary and special effects footage.
1486;The technological advancements made with this film are spectacular and it's really interesting to see just how difficult things that may only appear on screen for a few seconds were to film, take after take.
1487;I greatly respect and admire all those involved with this film.
1488;And agree with everyone that includes this movie as one of the classics.
1489;If you love Forrest like I do you will love it in Blu.
1490;I really love this film
1491;I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it.
1492;Gave it to my friend for a gift while she's away at school.
1493;He's always been my favorite actor, but I honestly never saw this movie until last night.
1494;It was phenomenal, to say the very least.
1495;"The filming was outstanding, as was Gary Sinise as ""Lt. Dan""."
1496;I truly believe this is one of the BEST movies ever made.
1497;To be honest, this is the first time I ever write a review of a movie.
1498;In the film, Forrest Gump is a very pure image, but Jenny has become the degenerate symbol .
1499;And write the great discrepancy originally in this.
1500;To all that narrated, since beginning all behave with a kind of tender feeling and well.
1501;Make film apt to accept by people, director superb lay out skill and film application of language make the film very attractive too.
1502;Success with commercial for film content of the film has given security.
1503;At least it's wholesome, and some of the counter.
1504;culture figures on the show are held up to be less than perfect.
1505;He says the film is simply about the day dreams of the kind.
1506;It will be more fun if you watch this movie before or after you visit Savannah, WashingtonDC, Alabama and Monument Valley.
1507;You feel for Forrest throughout his life, particularly when he discovers he has a son (who's smart in IQ terms).
1508;"The ""holy fool"" Forrest gets a boost from sarcastic Gary Sinise (who's got a reason to be bitter), Sally Field, and the terrific Robin Wright Penn."
1509;If you haven't watched in a while, this movie is so worth the time.
1510;I watched with my teenagers and they thoroughly enjoyed it.
1511;Gave relevance to historic events and Bubba Gumps Restaurants!
1512;Forrest Gump is a truely wonderful film.
1513;I remember seeing it after it won Best Picture, and even at age nine it touched me, inspired me, and made me laugh.
1514;After seeing it, I decided it was one of the best movies ever created.
1515;Now, after seven years, it still holds strong on my list of favorite movies.
1516;This is always the best movie!
1517;I heard from friends that this movie was great and it won 6 academy awards in 1994.
1518;This movies has expresses excellent adventure, drama, comedy, and romance.
1519;You will feel like you have watched a 100 great movies after watching this movie.
1520;This is Tom Hanks best performance ever.
1521;My Fianc and I were looking for a nice show to just relax and enjoy.
1522;Forrest Gump is very enjoyable.
1523;A positive movie that will lighten your spirits.
1524;We recommend it to all ages.
1525;I have never seem forest gump until the other day it is a great movie.
1526;It's a must see movie
1527;It is a very emotional movie with a very well thought out story line and well developed characters that push the story on.
1528;forrest gump has got to be one of the best movie's of all time!
1529;just watch the movie, and you too, will be moved.
1530;it's both funny and very emotional(especially when jenny dies and forrest's mommy).
1531;haley joel osment and tom hanks are so cute for their roles.
1532;ray version makes it even better!
1533;It's a must have movie in everyone's collection!
1534;This movie is an absolute classic.
1535;Evan after all these years, I enjoyed it again.
1536;It brought oit all emotions, happiness sadness, pity, excitement, joy.
1537;Taking apart the fact that Tom Hanks is one of my 4 favorites actors (TH, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro y Robin Williams), this is one of the most touching and innocent movies I have ever seen.
1538;The messages are so subtle and nice, it makes you laugh and makes you cry.
1539;And of course, it has a special place in my personal collection.
1540;Definitely recommend it to others and I will certainly watch it again.
1541;I agree with a lot of the reviewers here that this movie is technically very well done.
1542;There is some very good acting in it.
1543;i have loved this movie from the first time i saw it,and it is one i will watch over and over again.
1544;I love all of Tom Hanks films.
1545;and he always gives 100% and more.
1546;and each time it affects me the same way.
1547;A very emotional, heart warming film.
1548;the entire cast were perfectly selected for their roles and most memorable:Robin Wright as Jenny.You just keep hoping she'll go running back to Forrest (even tho you've seen it before)Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan.
1549;he and Hanks are a perfect match as buddies.
1550;the southern accent really adds to her character.
1551;so many classic scenes.You wont ever tire of seeing this masterpiece.
1552;this movie will go down as his best or at least tied for best actor performance of all time.
1553;classic, one of my all time favorites.
1554;An OUTSTANDING film, Forrest Gump, follows the life of a young boy from Alabama as he grows up and through him sheds light not only on his life, but on modern American history as well.
1555;it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, innocence, friendship, and inner strength.
1556;tom Hanks, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.
1557;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
1558;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention quite a few tears.
1559;The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.
1560;This is a wonderful movie that anyone can enjoy.
1561;I loved the way actual news reels were interwoven into the story.
1562;One of the best movies of all time!
1563;Tom Hanks' greatness can't even be described by words.
1564;love this movie, bought to replace it on vhs.
1565;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1566;It was well put together.
1567;It was also very touching.
1568;You must see this movie you will laugh and cry and get happy.
1569;Visit a Bubba Gump bar/restaurant if you have a chance, so you can remember this classic film.
1570;Tom Hanks and Sally Fields do an amazing job acting in the film.
1571;I enjoy the story line and mama's wisdom that Forrest is always quoting.
1572;It is a classic movie!
1573;One of our All time favorite.
1574;It Has a good moral story and lesson.
1575;Most movies are about the bravest, the strongest, and the most beautiful / handsome as they plow through their lives.
1576;But through the perseverence of his loving, single mother, he gets the foundation in life, the moral strength, and the perseverence to thrive.
1577;She pours all her love and dedication into raising her son to be able to take care of himself and to be content.
1578;She sleeps with the school's principle when he tells her that Forrest can't go to school.
1579;She tells Forrest repeatedly that he is just as good as anyone else, and that life is unpredictable and that that is normal.
1580;"The line in the movie is: ""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates."
1581;It's important to remember that it GOT popular because so many people relate to its meaning.
1582;You might like the flavor of a chocolate, or dislike it, but it's all part of life, and you go on and have another one.
1583;hanks shines in this, as does Sinise, and both are well deserving of the many awards they won.
1584;But he is still a complex character.
1585;With the conviction in his voice, and the emotion in his face, you know absolutely that he does.
1586;He invented the smiley face.
1587;He knows exactly what she's going through, inside, and gets to the core of the emotion.
1588;"So we have an entire movie full of men and then ""the mom"" and ""the love""."
1589;I would have appreciated greatly a more rich world.
1590;I could name a million reasons why this movie is considered one of the best.
1591;The fact that is was wonderfully written?
1592;Whatever reason it is, it has definately got me hooked on this movie for life.
1593;"This one went by the name of Jenny Curran (Hanna R. Hall), who would soon become Forrest ""very best friend""."
1594;To achieve goals, you must set them out but Forrest never set his goals out, he just made them happen which is another reason why this is one of the best films ever made.
1595;forrest Gump managed to earn an Oscar for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemickis), Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing.
1596;Gary Sinise, who played Lt. Dan, managed to earn a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
1597;What I found amazing about this endless film is the way Zemickis brought back alive the past.
1598;It was really interesting and impressing how Zemickis made it look like Tom Hanks was really there with them all.
1599;up lines in this film.
1600;Who else knows a movie that EVERYONE can enjoy?
1601;A movie with much power, enough power to bring tears to your eyes?
1602;A movie that is unforgettable?
1603;A movie that has that MANY memorable scenes?
1604;Hanks was phenomenal and completely believable with his portrayal and of course Dennis Senise as Lt. Dan will always be one of the great ones.
1605;Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorite directors ever since Back to the Future.
1606;I love how the story interweaves the title character in and through some great historical moments throughout the movie.
1607;Laughing and crying the whole way.
1608;I guess most people would say that Forrest is too simple but I enjoyed a movie that did not require a lot of thought.
1609;There are a lot of ways to interpret this movie.
1610;I enjoyed it for the fourth or fifth time.
1611;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
1612;I love the music throughout the movie.
1613;Tom Hanks is awesome as Forrest.
1614;This movie is a classic.
1615;A great story and well.
1616;We watched with our 11& 14 year old boys and they loved it too.
1617;It has a couple scenes that raised some questions, but it was good conversation.
1618;Forrest Gump is a feel good movie, simple as that.
1619;And that's what it makes you do, feel good.
1620;Forrest Gump is a great, simple movie.
1621;My family loves this movie and we were excited to find it in such awesome condition.
1622;How wonderful a place the world would be if even 10% of men were like Forrest Gump .
1623;amazingly simple, astoundingly perfect and alarmingly good.
1624;love and committment have such universal chord that it brings in tears spontaneously when two people destined for each other, eventually get married too.
1625;"I had not read the novel before watching the movie
I:8439;1626;it seems almost a perfect reward for Forrest's life time contributions of being a good man.
I:8439;1627;the best part of the movie is that it does make one shed at least one undesirable trait of one's persona, rather uassumingly.
I:8439;1628;The power of love and humanism, and the demands it makes on one's emotions, is indeed the only reason for every human being to be born and stay alive.
I:8439;1629;tom Hanks is brilliant and uarguably the best actor around in our times.
I:8439;1630;The best word to describe this movie is, magical.
I:8439;1631;To enjoy it, one must suspend reality for a bit and simply, let it work it's magic on you.
I:8439;1632;The story begins with a pan of a feather delicately falling from the sky to forrests' feet.
I:8439;1633;He begins telling them his life story, and the movie takes off from there.
I:8439;1634;Despite all his attempts to be just like the other kids he is a very unique individual, and that is his magic.
I:8439;1635;The film is a brilliant next step to the classic Peter Sellers hit Being There .
I:8439;1636;It's very subdued and intelligent humour that needs to be taken with a small smirk rather than a loud gaffaw.
I:8439;1637;The scenes delicately set up the humour and the circumstance is the punch line.
I:8439;1638;But if you do, you are well rewarded for your efforts.
I:8439;1639;The worlds disbelief at his audacious running just to do it inspires a whole generation of people to just do it , sound familiar?Suddenly he's leading a jogging craze across america, and when he finally stops, no one knows what to do.
I:8439;1640;It's brilliant bitter sarcasm that puts society and all it's pretensions in it's place.
I:8439;1641;if you can sit back and take the movie for what it is, without allusions or expectations you will absolutely love this.
I:8439;1642;This is a movie you can be proud to introduce to your children and inspire them to think critically about what they are viewing, or it's also a movie you can watch for yourself and have a smirk at how strange real life can be.
I:8439;1643;It's a very intelligent movie that deserves a good viewing.
I:8439;1644;what can i say, i love ol forest and how he thinks.
I:8439;1645;gave it to my mom she loves it too.
I:8439;1646;Forrest Gump is a heartwarming story about a guy who never gives up.
I:8439;1647;This is one Tom Hanks most memorable roles.
I:8439;1648;You know, it is a sweet, endearing movie and yet at the same time it kicks us while we're down.
I:8439;1649;All of Gump's successes and triumphs are more about circumstance than actual effort.
I:8439;1650;Case in point: Gump's shrimp outfit soars.
I:8439;1651;gump's triumph over the misfortune of others?
I:8439;1652;Hanks is a brilliant actor and this film is no exception.
I:8439;1653;Forrest Gump is a wonderful movie with many lesson of life.
I:8439;1654;Forrest shows us people can be great with even though not perfect or the smart one in class.
I:8439;1655;This is seriously one of the best movies made of our time.
I:8439;1656;This is an awesome movie!
I:8439;1657;Love the characters, story, and message!
I:8439;1658;Can't say enough wonderful things about this movie!
I:8439;1659;It is a timeless classic!
I:8439;1660;This was a great movie to share.
I:8439;1661;this movie is very interesting in its telling of the story of a slow man who through his search for the women he loves changes American pop culture and it deserves the title of best picture it won
I:8439;1662;I found the downloading to be easy and quick.
I:8439;1663;The students loved the movie and were able to make all of the connection s that were taught in the US History class.
I:8439;1664;the movie is about all that can be good in us, human beings.
I:8439;1665;By looking at things in a very simple moral way Forres Gump becomes a success without really wanting to be.
I:8439;1666;very few movies tap into these particular feelings, and this movie does it very well without being religious.
I:8439;1667;This movie is like poetry in motion.
I:8439;1668;All it takes is a strong will and a lot of spirit.
I:8439;1669;I will keep this brief, as I will presume that everyone is familiar with this classic movie and epic performance by Tom Hanks (who is a genius).
I:8439;1670;com will suffice as to the films subject matter.
I:8439;1671;It is great when you can share it with the young kids in your family and they wonder how the director and the agents found the actors to look so much like former Presidents such as Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.
I:8439;1672;and watch how their eyes light up in amazement!
I:8439;1673;Very wonderful and moving story of young men during the war and the struggle with drugs back in the early days.
I:8439;1674;Forrest Gump is a landmark film, touching on many delicate aspects of human life, love and values.
I:8439;1675;it is just a """"feel good"""" movie as many have written?"""
1676;Mine (now history, thanks God!)
1677;"ray disc is very good, containing interesting interviews with Hanks and the director, as well as other ""behind the scenes"" material, including the making of special effects which were painstaking to produce and quite advanced for the time."
1678;I love this movies it shows life can be a big adventure.
1679;i think this is one of Tom Hank's best movies.
1680;i rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
1681;But it is so much more than that.
1682;There is always something, whether it be humorous or heart.
1683;Out of all the Tom Hanks films I've seen, this one is by far the greatest.
1684;Actually, I'm prepared to say that this is the single greatest performance by an actor I've seen (and I've seen some good ones!)
1685;I really Love this movie, it's one of the best movies ever made, plus Tom Hanks is a Great actor, I like everymovie he's played in.
1686;It is one of the greatest movies than I've ever seen BUT it doesn't have spanish subtitles.
1687;"i love this moviei think everyone needs to watch this and learn from forrest gumpThis movie will make you cry and laugh, it will make you think more about what to do with your life and the message is beautifu
I:8439;1688;No matter how many times you watch it this movie is still great.
I:8439;1689;Makes me laugh every time.
I:8439;1690;It was just what I wanted.
I:8439;1691;I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he was so happy!
I:8439;1692;I have seen this movie a dozen times and hope to watch it a dozen more.
I:8439;1693;It makes me laugh and cry every time.
I:8439;1694;A touching story of how one intellectually challenged individual comes to touch the lives of others with God's help.
I:8439;1695;Forrest Gump is an inspiring movie that encourages us all to become helpful to our fellow man through grace.
I:8439;1696;A movie filled with wonder and loss, emotions and dedication, and deeper meanings of what we see of people, Forrest Gump is a really wonderful movie.
I:8439;1697;I love the twists and turns, and I also like how Forrest's deeper feelings are shown.
I:8439;1698;Friends, enemies, and lovers are combined into this film.
I:8439;1699;Through his story he meets Jennie and Bubba, the love of his life and his best friend.
I:8439;1700;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:8439;1701;I laughed a lot, but afterwards I had to sit and think about what Forrest had gone through.
I:8439;1702;This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion.
I:8439;1703;I really enjoyed this movie and I think that anyone who watches it will, too.
I:8439;1704;Definitely one of my favorite films.
I:8439;1705;If you liked The Fisher King and The World According To Garp you'll probably love Forrest Gump.
I:8439;1706;This film will catapult you equally into as many laughs as tears.
I:8439;1707;Its almost not a film but trully a filmic piece of art.
I:8439;1708;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:8439;1709;Tom Hanks is wonderful in it.
I:8439;1710;The story line is fantastical, but quaint and very entertaining.
I:8439;1711;This movies is by far one of my favorite movies.
I:8439;1712;Grab your tissues because it is a tear jerker.
I:8439;1713;FORREST GUMP is one of those magical movies that not only demands your attention during its run of 142 minutes, but it also causes you to ponder it long after the closing credits.
I:8439;1714;His memories of a life twisted by the evils of the outside world but strengthened by his own iron core of solid values form the basis of the film.
I:8439;1715;fORREST GUMP allows Hanks to portray a critical period of American history in a series of vignettes that brings to mind Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES, with each tale of both epics ranging from comedy, to pathos, to stark tragedy.
I:8439;1716;Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan are essentially good people who have blind spots that prevent them from seeing the world as clearly as does Forrest.
I:8439;1717;One of the central ironies of the film is that director Zemeckis wants the audience to believe.
I:8439;1718;FORREST GUMP is one of the best pictures of all time and repeated viewings merely confirms that.
I:8439;1719;This Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture 1994 and Best Director.
I:8439;1720;robert Zemeckis, based on a novel by Winston Groom is still considered as one of the greatest and most beautiful movies ever made.
I:8439;1721;tom Hanks gives an outstanding and powerful performance as Forrest Gump a disabled and mentally challenged boy that grows up to be a successful man accomplishing things most people never do and proving to the world that anything is possible when you have a big heart, positive mind, and people that love you.
I:8439;1722;A story about a young boy with braces on his legs and a low IQ, but loved by his mama.
I:8439;1723;With his faith in God and mama's words, his love for Jenny, and friends like Bubba and Lieutenant Dan, Forrest will take you on an incredible and unbelievable journey of life and love.
I:8439;1724;forrest Gump is a wonderful and heart.
I:8439;1725;warming story that will show you that one person's will can make a difference and change the history and people's lives forever.
I:8439;1726;Just about the best movie EVER.
I:8439;1727;It is even great for kids who need reaffirmation of their value.
I:8439;1728;You can never go wrong with Tom Hanks and Sally Fields, they are amazing in this movie.
I:8439;1729;This movie make you laugh and cry at the same time.
I:8439;1730;The tale of the simple man Forrest Gump from his boyhood in the 1950's to his adulthood in the early '80s, was very well written and done.
I:8439;1731;Tom Hanks was very convincing.
I:8439;1732;One of the messages of this movie is that there are some moral absolutes in this world, and that even a simple man can see that.
I:8439;1733;Forrest loved his country and obeyed his God.
I:8439;1734;His story was a very touching story, with romance and passion.
I:8439;1735;It is a true American tale, with history passing before our eyes.
I:8439;1736;It was also very funny.
I:8439;1737;You get it all in two hours and love it!
I:8439;1738;The amazing tale of a mentaly challenged man and a passionate love story.
I:8439;1739;He ends up attending Alabama where he is an All.
I:8439;1740;He also meets Bubba(Williamson) who he later names his shirmping company after.
I:8439;1741;She gets into drugs and goes through the hippie movement.
I:8439;1742;She does disco and does more drugs.
I:8439;1743;She realizes her life is the pit, but theres one thing thats always been constant in her life and that Forrest.
I:8439;1744;tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is captivating.
I:8439;1745;It's one of the greatest performances by an actor ever.
I:8439;1746;He won the Oscar that year for Best Actor and it would have been a sham if he haven't.
I:8439;1747;His peformance as the mentally challenged man in all the big events will bring you to tears.
I:8439;1748;Tom Hanks is the man and In my opinion this is top 5 performances ever.
I:8439;1749;robin Wright gives the performance of her carear in this movie.
I:8439;1750;She displays the emotions of the character so well.
I:8439;1751;They stir up memories and everything looks authentic.
I:8439;1752;It's magical and funny as you think back about these two love birds and the situations they are in.
I:8439;1753;gary Sinise gives the performance of his carear as well.
I:8439;1754;He should have won it over Marin Landua.
I:8439;1755;There friendship is special and the two change each others lives.
I:8439;1756;It's a special movie and the way he made it is beautiful.
I:8439;1757;He deserved his Oscar for Best Director.
I:8439;1758;the movie is so well made.
I:8439;1759;It won Oscars for Editing and Effects and you will see why.
I:8439;1760;It was nominated for 13 Oscars and it won six.
I:8439;1761;It could have easily won any of the others as well.
I:8439;1762;The stuff on the making of the movie is great.
I:8439;1763;The documentaries are great as well.
I:8439;1764;this is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8439;1765;It's a passionate love story and an awesome tail of a man, just being himself.
I:8439;1766;Everybody should see this movie at one point or another in life.
I:8439;1767;Tom Hanks is marvellous in this fantastic film!
I:8439;1768;I highly recommend this should be in film fan's personal library.
I:8439;1769;I watched on 08.13.2003 at 11:00 AM and I just loved it.
I:8439;1770;This is the reason why Tom Hanks is one of the best actors in the world.
I:8439;1771;The movie is very depressing, but it really shows you the journey of a person.
I:8439;1772;a movie that is based on the heart of a man who is not very smart, but his lack of intelligence makes him a happy, giving, and honest man.
I:8439;1773;outstanding perfomance by Tom Hanks, who has become one of the best actors on Hollywood and one of my favorites actors.

I:8439;1782;I'm going to disagree with a couple of other reviewers on here, and say this is a great movie.

I:8439;1784;I love this movie, despite the length, and it has a great many stars in it: Robin Wright Penn, Sally Field, and Gary Sinise, to name but a few.

I:8439;1795;For the 50th time I sat down to watch forest Gump a couple of nights ago and I watched Tom Hanks and I thought to myself how good of an actor can a man be to win two Oscars in a row.
I:8439;1796;this movie is the only movie I can say that every single person in my family has seen and loved from young to old and I know that all of them own it.
I:8439;1797;Great job amazon as always you have come through.

I:8439;1803;The story telling, the story line, the cinematography, the special effects, the ACTING .
I:8439;1804;everything about this movie is just excellent.
I:8439;1805;It's a movie that will make you remember why we watch movies.
I:8439;1806;This movie was moving and funny.
I:8439;1807;I enjoyed the part when Forrest says to President Kennedy, I gotta pee.
I:8439;1808;Lt. Dan was hilarious also especially when he puts his ice cream cone in the bed pan.
I:8439;1809;I will always remember this movie.
I:8439;1810;This is a good picture .
I:8439;1811;and Tom Hanks is definately at the top of the bar.
I:8439;1812;, Well which picture do you think was better.
I:8439;1813;So why did GUMP steal the Best Picture Academy Award that year?
I:8439;1814;When I first saw the film Forrest Gump in a theater in 1994, I knew that director Robert Zemeckis had created a heart.
I:8439;1815;warming masterpiece that would more than likely earn it Oscar recognition, and it certainly did.
I:8439;1816;The endearing film follows the life of an educationally challenged man named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) from the time of his childhood (played by Michael Conner Humphreys) until early middle age.
I:8439;1817;Bubba loved to talk about shrimp and Lt. Dan was raised to be a soldier.
I:8439;1818;tom Hanks' superb performance as the loveable Forrest Gump earned him his well.
I:8439;1819;deserved second Oscar for Best Actor.
I:8439;1820;(He had previously won the Oscar for Best Actor for the 1993 film Philadelphia , and has been nominated three other times.)
I:8439;1821;Robert Zemeckis also earned the Oscar for Best Director, and the film itself won the Oscar for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Writing.
I:8439;1822;Gary Sinise earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, in addition to six other Oscar nominations that included Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Sound.
I:8439;1823;Part of what Forrest Gump so endearing was Zemeckis' use of superimposing actors into actual, historical film footage.
I:8439;1824;I regard Forrest Gump as one of the best films ever made and rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.
I:8439;1825;It's the kind of film that draws the viewer into its story and keeps the viewer engaged throughout its 142 minutes.
I:8439;1826;Tom Hanks went on to star in many more memorable film roles, including his roles in Apollo 13 (1995), Saving Private Ryan (1998), The Green Mile (1999) and Cast Away (2000) to name a few.
I:8439;1827;Go into 'setup' and select the ' English 5.1 surround' and that should work.
I:8439;1828;Very nice blue ray to an iconic film.
I:8439;1829;Filled with spectacular special features which gives an in depth look to the creation of the movie.
I:8439;1830;The highly acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, the genius behind the cult classic `Back To The Future', can add another feather to his cap with this summers box office smash Forrest Gump.
I:8439;1831;This epic of human proportions, staring Tom Hanks as the smartest dumb person in America, will capture hearts world wide with its warming feel good story line.
I:8439;1832;or even an average on for that matter, but he still manages to become one of Americas most successful business tycoons.
I:8439;1833;He may not know much but he definitely knows how to treat people right.
I:8439;1834;Provided by the fantastically talented Robin Wright, this impossible relationship only fuels the love story making a classic cinema romance.
I:8439;1835;americans, drugs, capitalism and the mistreatment of women.
I:8439;1836;wit could pop up at opportune moments in history, winning hearts, amassing a fortune and becoming famous.
I:8439;1837;the acting is strong, the narrative is compelling and its semi.
I:8439;1838;documentary style direction is consistent and provides clarity and pace.

1840;But in no way is this film another tabloid version of history, what it depicts is done right with class and style

1851;Tom Hanks makes Forrest such a memorable character because we believe his character is real.
1852;action role so well (Toy Story's Woody is also well orchestrated, but Woody is a computer actor).
1853;This film holds a firm place in my top 10 for a number of reasons, but mainly because it is a reminder of my mom.
1854;It is something that will stay with me always.
1855;Forrest Gump is a classic movie that will be enjoyed by generations to come.

1874;I have always liked Tom Hanks, but in my opinion this was his best film.

1885;Emotional, humorous and with sufficient action elements, this film owns most to the superb (!)
1886;The simple fact that this movie is the Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor should be enough to convince you that this title is a must.
1887;We absolutely love this movie!
1888;"good"" movie wins the audience every time."
1889;"but what are you ""feeling good"" ABOUT."
1890;There is NOTHING desirable about being mentally challenged.
1891;"minded ""innocence"" over rational, thoughtful consideration of what's going on in the society around you."
1892;"This film makes light of many serious events in America's history for the sake of some ""gee."
1893;definitely NOT entertainment for any thinking, rational person.
1894;The film was highly effective, although was often seen more as a comic endeavor.
1895;forrest, played by Tom Hanks, is contrasted against his life.
1896;minded yet picture perfect view of reality.
1897;"i really liked the attempt that this movie made with the story of everlasting innocence and love
I:8439;1898;suppose.Yes, this film was good.

1902;Keep true and honest to yourself and your life will fall into place 3
1903;A wonderful story for all ages!

1908;It was a good now as when I saw it in the theaters years back!
1909;An instant classic, this movie is amazing.
1910;If you somehow haven't seem it yet you must must watch it!
1911;It's so easy to become attached to these characters.
1912;This movie is probally in the top ten of my favorite all time.
1913;Hanks gives a breathtaking performance as Forrest Gump, as does Gary Sinese as Lt. Dan.
1914;The soundtrack to this film is great old fashioned rock n roll(which I like).
1915;The movie is very sad in many scenes, but there are also many scenes of joy and humor.
1916;Bottom line is that if you want to see a movie about a simple man accomplishing every thing imaginable, this is what this film is.
1917;Forrest Gump is absolutely one of my favorite movies.
1918;The storyline and acting are wonderful.
1919;Every time I see it coming on one of the movie stations I have to watch.
1920;When I saw it here at a great price I had to have it.
1921;Great film, and it will last for generations.
1922;smart man and his wonderful life is the story of this movie.
1923;a wonderful story, and a great performance by Tom Hanks (I can see why he won the Oscar as Best Actor for the second time in a row for this movie), made this a very highly recommended movie!
1924;It is a magnificent movie with an all.
1925;star cast and a wonderful sceenplay based on the novel by Winston Groom.
1926;Forrest Gump is truly a classic and will always be remembered.
1927;Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks won Oscars for this while Sinise was nominated for one and Robin Wright Penn was nominated for a Golden Globe.
1928;extra: Haley Joel Osment makes a couple small cameos as Forrest's son.
1929;One of the greatest touching movies ever.
1930;Forrest Gump is a movie that will make you cry, and it will make you laugh.
1931;When I first saw it in 2001, It touched my heart.
1932;Tom Hanks is perfect as Forrest Gump.
1933;Won 6 Oscars for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemekis), Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Picture, and Best Screenplay.
1934;Went to this touching story about a simple man named Forrest Gump who, even though isn't very bright, accidently ends up getting involved with some of the biggest key moments of the 19th century.
1935;It's funny, touching, heart warming, and sad.
1936;I read the book, and the first line even touched me.
1937;I highly recommend watching this.
1938;Forrest Gump is a movie that is the winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture.
1939;It is also one of the best 90's movies ever made!
1940;I remember seeing it in the theaters 8 years ago.
1941;He fell in love with his childhood best friend Jenny(Robin Wright).
1942;You never know what you're gonna get!Forrest Gump is without a doubt one of the best films of the 1990s.
1943;Very unique, very original, very wonderful!
1944;The first with Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steve Starkey and Production Designer Rick Carter is a nice mix of storytelling, special effects talk, and personal memories, while the second commentary by Producer Wendy Finerman is a more intimate setting (since she's alone), giving cute stories such as the reason why the speakers are cut off while Forrest is speaking in Washington D. c. is because no one could think of anything profound enough for him to say for real.
1945;So many wonderful moments from the film are discussed, including how they were able to have Tom Hanks shake hands and interact with JFK, turning Tom into a ping pong wizard, as well as making Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) believably look as if he truly lost his legs.
1946;So that's how they did it!
1947;My only complaint is that the transfer of this documentary didn't seem crisp and sharp enough.
1948;A wonderful look at how the makeup in this film was so crucial to its success.
1949;Creating the places and settings of the film, including Forrest's home in Alabama, Vietnam, and Washington D. c. All crucial to the films believability.
1950;11 visual effects from the film are discussed, including 2 that didn't make the final cut.
1951;Nice to have them here though.
1952;Some nice still shots of the film that are definitely worth looking at.
1953;trailer, which contains no dialogue and just uses Alan Silvestri's wonderful score.

1955;And that's all I have to say about that .

1961;Pretty much a perfect film.
1962;This film sets out simply to entertain you and make you forget about all of your troubles for two hours.
1963;Tom Hanks is absoulutely amazing, making the viewer believe he is Forrest .
1964;the supporting cast (Sinise, Wright) is great.

1966;Forrest gump is a heart warming movie.
1967;tom hanks is fantastic in this film.
1968;This movie is a classic!
1969;Going with the characters through their times of life and important times of change through people's live's/love's is beautiful.
1970;Also, the innocence that Gump brings to life is wonderful.
1971;love this guy as an actor!
1972;The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is re.
1973;the odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss.
1974;Don't think about things and everything will work out nicely and you will be happy.
1975;Well at least you'll get rich .
1976;One of the best movies ever!The movie Forrest Gump isn't only just a good movie (or book adaptation, whatever you like) but it has an outstanding cast that really makes us feel what is happening on the screen.
1977;I have always thought that this show was a classic, and the price was right so I ordered it for other generations to see.
1978;amazon Instant video has a very good resolution movie.

1986;"He ""accidentally"" steps into some of the most important aspects of History, including when the first blacks were enrolled into a white college, playing on the All American Football Team in college, the Vietnam War where he meets Bubba and promises to start a shrimpin' business with him after they get out of the war, and many others."
1987;Most all of the historical editing is done superbly, with Hanks being inserted into many of the scenes.2001 TWO.
1988;mY OPINIONIn my personal opinion, this is a great movie.
1989;This has always been a favorite of ours, and the extra disc with the bonus features on it is a lot of fun, too.
1990;Makes you laugh, cry and say awwww.
1991;As one of Tom Hank's greatest achivements in the movie.
1992;which is something few movies are able to accomplish.
1993;The one thing that I do think a review is able to say without giving to much away is how the movie created a sence of far a person can really go in life.
1994;Think about that for a second and you'll see that's true.
1995;(keep in mind the asterisked words, that's what qualifies my statement)There are movies like this I do like, this is simply not one of them.
1996;didn't give it 5 stars due to foul language, Tom Hanks was endearing and funny.
1997;it is a true classic
1998;This is a great family movie.
1999;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!
2000;Tom Hanks is a DAMN good actor and everyone else in it is great too!
2001;He is in love with a girl name Jenny Curran (Robin Wright Penn ) who is Forest's friend, but just likes him as a friend.
2002;He's known her ever since they were little.
2003;Jenny then comes back to his life and realizes he has a kid.
2004;It can be very touching, which can make you drop a tear.
2005;It is very moving which if you haven't seen you got to watch this film.
2006;I don't really think it should have won best picture, I liked it but I liked Pulp Fiction better.
2007;Tom Hanks's performance is very great and truly deserved the Oscar.
2008;It also can be very heart warming in a sensitive way.
2009;The cinematography in this film is very breath taking.
2010;This movie can touch anyone and when you stop watching this film, it's just a feeling you can't explain.
2011;It also has behind the scenes, art design featurattes.
2012;It also has the trailer and TV spots of the film.
2013;It also has interviews with the cast and crew.
2014;Other than that these special features are pretty good.
2015;pong can personally meet several presidents, George Wallace, John Lennon, and pretty much everybody else worth meeting between 1963 and 1979, this pat parable is right up your street.
2016;The first time you watch it, it bilks you into thinking it's just a high.
2017;spirited fable, but the more times you watch it, the more you realize it's based on broad twists of fate and extreme leaps of logic, culminating in a moral so simplistic that Aesop would have laughed out loud at it.
2018;its success rests primarily in its having been made in the 1990's, a time when we believed we could accomplish anything by simple skill and sheer force of will.
2019;We've moved past that time, and we have a more cold.
2020;This film is an amazing work of historical fiction.
2021;There is humor, as well as romance and drama, throughout the entire film to keep viewers engaged.
2022;I recommend this film for everyone, but especially those who appreciate history and love the time period from the 1950s to the 1980s.
2023;One of the greatest films of all time.
2024;and definitely one of the two best Tom Hanks performances EVER!
2025;"with a close third for ""Cast Away""."
2026;i highly recommend this film for everyone.
2027;Everyone will find something in this film to relate to and love.
2028;Forrest Gump is the most amazing movie I have ever seen and will ever see.
2029;You will laugh and cry.
2030;Forrest Gump is the sweeping story of a simpleton (Tom Hanks) whose view of the world is both clairvoyant and poignant.
2031;What makes the film so remarkable is its handling of the central character.
2032;Like Dustin Hoffman's Raymond, Tom Hanks brilliant performance as Forrest is thoughtful, introspective and fine wrought with compassion.
2033;Gary Sinise is magnificent as Lt. Dan Taylor .
2034;Sally Fields excels as Forrest's mother, a woman determined to see that her son lives a full and useful life.
2035;There's a considerable amount of film and digital grain present for a picture that, at times, is smooth, but at other times is rather harsh on the eyes.
2036;The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced with a real kick in the musical score and special effects.
2037;The extras include a documentary on the making of the film, some interviews with the cast members and director, the film's theatrical trailer and some television spots.
2038;I have always enjoyed this movie.
2039;To start with, Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are two of my favorite actors.
2040;For the obviously good acting job that Hanks did, I did not then feel that this film deserved to win best picture.
2041;While I still view Gump as a little too sentimental, I have to admit that it is one heck of a picture.
2042;great performances abound in this movie.
2043;Sinise is outstanding as Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
2044;He manages to be over the top without becoming absurd.
2045;Wright's Jenny is a moving counterpoint to Forest.
2046;Mykelti Williamson does a great job with what he is given.
2047;the world as seen through the eyes of Forest Gump is definitely not reality.
2048;one of the best movies ever loved it well worth the price thanks amazon this is the best movie ever
2049;Forrest Gump is just an all time classic movie.
2050;It is a very thoughtful movie with some sad scenes, but overall the humor is very enjoyable in it.
2051;As he strides back and forth across America, becoming hairier by the minute, are we not walking in the crowd behind him, trying to get a grip on what it's all about?
2052;it's a fascinating look at America, with its odd historical background and the tendency for the underdog to somehow win through.
2053;Tom Hanks does a phenomenal job in playing the role of ForestGump!
2054;This is the best movie I've ever saw.
2055;Is absolutely perfect in all way.
2056;The story is amazing, the Tom Hank's performance is perfect, the music is perfect.
2057;Nobody can lose this fine piece of art.
2058;It is ironic in an endearing way to try to rate this movie in an intellectual and important voice.
2059;This movie celebrates what I think Thoreau would have classified a deliberate existence.
2060;I got this movie for my fiancee because it is his favorite.
2061;The book and feather were neat, so he was still happy.
2062;Tom Hanks is a true master of the acting arts.

I:8439;2098;An odd movie about a simple man who grows up being genuinely nice to everyone no matter who they may be or what they may have done.
I:8439;2099;Tom Hanks is spectacular in his portrayal of Forrest.
I:8439;2100;The movie sends a clear message to the viewers, """"No matter what happens, take it in stride."""
2101;"If you're a fan of smart films like ""The Green Mile"" and ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"", then you will definitely love ""Forrest Gump"""
2102;Higly overated, this sentimental flick is part Zelig, part Being There.
2103;in the end it's interesting, funny, and actually entertaining.
2104;This is a great movie for reminiscing with kids.
2105;FORREST GUMP is a movie about a backward young boy who grows up to lead a remarkable life while managing to get involved in some of the most important world events of the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon years.

2108;fORREST GUMP won Oscars for Best Picture, Director (Robert Zemeckis), Actor (Tom Hanks), Adopted Screenplay, Art Direction, Film Editing and Visual Effects.
2109;You can't go wrong with a Tom Hanks movie under just about any conditions, but this one really shines.
2110;The special effects, the history, the music, Tom's performance and an excellent supporting cast make this audio.
2111;Throw in a little love for the women and some war scenes for the guys and there's definitely something for everyone.
2112;I own this movie on video cassette and I still watch it from time to time.

2137;Loved the movie, it's funny, serious, and down right good.
2138;Tom Hanks is excellent in it and I've always loved Sally Field.
2139;An enjoyable movie for the whole family.
2140;Forrest Gump is a rare movie that succeeded on all levels.
2141;It was a box office smash ranking among the top five highest grossing movies of all time.
2142;The movie has a nostalgic, feel good vibe thanks to the dimwitted Forrest's trek through 60's and 70's touchstone events.
2143;Underneath all those warm feelings lies a darkness.
2144;There are superb performances all around.
2145;Sally Field is feisty as Forrest's mama, Mykelti Williamson is funny as Bubba, Gary Sinese as Lt. Dan is a perfect rough edged foil to Forrest and Robin Wright as Jenny portrays the confusion that young people of the times felt perfectly.
2146;He is utterly brilliant as Forrest.
2147;Mr. Hanks deservedly won his second consecutive Best Actor Oscar for the role and cemented himself as the best actor of his generation and one of the best of all time.
2148;This novel is simple, but it is a great story.
2149;Jenny is Forrest's best friend since their childhoods.
2150;Forrest has a strong feeling to Jenny, later Jenny becomes his girlfriend.
2151;This is a simple sentence, but it has influenced Forrest a lot.
2152;Also, this sentence implies that life is full of surprise like a box of chocolates which make Forrest expect to enjoy having his life.
2153;She does her best and gives everything she can.
2154;she is a great mom.
2155;This is an encouraged book, so people who luck confident or complain about their lives should read this book to cheer up.
2156;In conclusion, this is a good book, and everyone should read it because one can always learn something from this book.
2157;I hate Tom Hanks, but he is a good actor and this show is interesting, if highly unprobable.
2158;Forrest Gump, a 1994 American epic award.
2159;winning movie about the Vietnam War centers on the life of Forrest Gump, a boy with an IQ of 75.
2160;He starts telling the story way back to when he was a young boy.
2161;in my opinion, this movie was outstanding.
2162;warming, well acted, and definitely worthy of its many Oscars.
2163;One reason that I particularly liked it so much was that it helped me gain a clearer understanding of America and its people during the time of the Vietnam War.
2164;For example, one of the interesting things that I learned was about the state of people when they got back from war.
2165;One other interesting thing that I learned that was not really directed towards the war was that the famous quote Life is a box of chocolates actually came from this movie.
2166;To me, this quote is very important and is something to live by.
2167;As well as this, I learned a lot about the history and relationship between China and the United States.
2168;pong competition on a goodwill tour, a tournament in which Forrest participated in himself.
2169;This really surprised me, as it was still during the war and China was on the side of the Communists.
2170;Some other connections that I made with the movie and what we have learned in class is with the movie Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam , where we saw real footage from Vietnam, and heard voiceovers of people reading letters from real soldiers serving in the army during that time.
2171;overall, the movie Forrest Gump directed by Robert Zemeckis is an amazing one that depicts the life of a man who has been through so many important historical events in his lifetime, and shows how he dealt with all of the problems, in the simplest of ways.
2172;Forrest Gump was a wonderful movie and had a fantastic cast.
2173;Certain quotes are so memorable and sometimes you just want to hug Forrest.
2174;Forrest Jr was adorable and the movie was wonderful
2175;Show the agreement between the huge history and the personal experiences, it's a epic about American politics from the little experience perspective .
2176;But every plots in this story are reflected his essentially kind, simplicity, we also can see forrest gump is a temperament middleman who knows how to love.
2177;Highly recommended to all ages from the young and the young at heart.
2178;Forest Gump became a classic the minute it hit the theaters.
2179;Very well produced, casted and directed.
2180;Heartfelt, tender and warm story that gets on everyones heart.
2181;It's a valuable gift for the movie goers.
2182;Forrest Gump has to be one of Ton Hanks' best pictures he has ever produced.
2183;1994 was difeinately his best year, when he won back.
2184;He plays a man, born in a place called Greenbow, Alabama.
2185;While he waits, he has a nice chat to people who pass by and he tells them about his life.
2186;pong champion, shrimp fisherman and a whole lot more.
2187;But he also has deep feelings.
2188;He has a special someone that he is deeply in love with.
2189;most of the time, the film concentrates on Forrest and Jenny.
2190;It shows how they meet, what they do together, how they split up, how they get back together etc. the film is very touching, as it nears the end, but it also is very funny, with stupid things always occuring.
2191;It also contains some action when he is in Vietnam.
2192;I liked Gary Sinise as Forrest's caption in Nam.
2193;The beautiful Robin Wright played Jenny, and Sally Field played Forrest's helpful mother.
2194;This is one of the only movies I can enjoy watching over and over.
2195;Screen play is beautiful, Hanks is perfect for the role, and the story line is the best.
2196;The film Forrest Gump is a wonderful modern day fairy tale.
2197;It is the story of a simple man stumbling his way through life, but because of his ability to run, leads an extraordinary life.
2198;the greatest strength this movie has is how it tells the story spanning a lifetime in only two and a half hours.
2199;forrest's life is a magical journey like that of Odysseus or Frodo Baggins, but set in our modern world.
2200;Yes, the audience has to suspend their belief of a simple guy making it so far in the cruel world.
2201;No, it isn't likely, but that's what makes it extraordinary.
2202;That's what makes it a fantasy.

2207;The all star cast is one of the film's best points.

2209;The blueray version is so much better.

2294;This is so well written it will blow you away.
2295;I really enjoyed this movie.
2296;This is one of the best movies that Tom Hanks was in.
2297;This movie really moves you inside.
2298;I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 1994.
2299;I also found it rather impressive to see how they placed Hanks in with the past presidents when he would visit the White House.
2300;I highly recommend this movie to someone who has not seen this movie.
2301;Very pleased!The delay for delivery was shorter than expected and the product was in perfect condition.
2302;"But then he also describes Kevin Costner as ""an intelligent actor""."
2303;the film constantly pokes fun at people and institutions .

2306;Takes one back to a for familiar and comfortable time.
2307;It received and deserved five Academy Awards and could have received others as well.
2308;Of special interest to me is director Robert Zemeckis and his crew's brilliant integration of material from Winston Groom's novel with historical material in the 1960s and 1970s.
2309;I admire Forrest because he is a thoroughly decent man whose wisdom cannot be measured by I. q. tests or net worth.
2310;I would be proud to have him as a son or son.
2311;It will be worth your while.
2312;I've watch this movie many times and enjoy it with each revisit.
2313;Tom Hanks is a wonderful action and the story interesting and also funny in spots.
2314;I forgot how wonderful this film was until we watched it as a family again.
2315;Tom Hanks is great, and so is Sally Field
2316;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
2317;the story is heartwarming, and the historical references are great.
2318;Even though it is a silly story I like it because it is a love story.
2319;It touched my heart because of the love!
2320;Forrest Gump is a tale of America's culture from the 50s through almost the present day, and it is brilliantly done.
2321;I have always liked Hanks as an actor, and here he puts in an unusual and yes, a brilliant performance.
2322;but the real star of the movie is America of the 50s through the early 80s.
2323;The portion of the film that dealt with the Vietnam conflict was unforgettable, as we see large numbers of ordinary American boys swept into a conflict that they little understood.
2324;the film hilariously shows Forrest Gump navigate through many of the key events in history during the periods.
2325;He meets Elvis and influences his style.
2326;He has a ringside seat in the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.
2327;He is caught up in the Vietnam War.
2328;He meets President Nixon and inadvertantly triggers the Watergate scandal (this part is really a hoot).
2329;The film's portrayal of the hippies and radicals of the 60s is particularly funny and in fact rings true.
2330;this is a film that almost everyone will like, and which will touch even the most hard.
2331;This movie is a pure representation of how a person with no expectations from anyone, with little needs can live a happy life.
2332;I have no doubts about Tom Hanks acting ability so I would not talk about it here, he is great actor.
2333;And it came in a nice package.
2334;The movie was a great price and just as expected.
2335;Good for the whole family.
2336;I brilliant twist on historic events!
2337;Love the scenery and locations!
2338;This is one of my fiance's favoriate movies and when I found that out, I ordered it for him right away as most of his belonings were lost during a recent move.
2339;He smiled really big when he opened it.
2340;so glad I could replace something that he enjoyed.
2341;But, instead, this unlucky man has achieved lots of incredible success, he is a football star, a war hero, and later a millionaire!Tom Hanks very much sincere naturally performance having among film.
2342;He is the definitely the best actor of Oscar.
2343;A great story with a WONDERFUL ending.
2344;Forrest Gump was such a sweet and endearing individual.
2345;As clearly stated by many this is far from the best blu.
2346;Funny and heartwarming all at the same time.
2347;Just one of those movies that everyone should see at least once.
2348;Tom Hanks is so good in this movie!
2349;But I loved every moment of this movie.
2350;the message I got from Forest Gump was that we are all important in this world.
2351;Forest was a simple minded fellow, but he also was focused, persistent, humble and he cared deeply about those he loved.
2352;those are the qualities that made him successful and enabled him to accomplish all manner of good things.
2353;Academy Award winner Robert Zemekis and two time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks bring the epic Forrest Gump alive at times funny hilarious and rediculous at other times it has alot of heartwarming moments and strength to pull it off asan enduring human spirit film.
2354;Tom Hanks won an award as theamazingly and engaging Forrest Gump a mentally disabled manwho may be slow but has found himself in his youth with his ability to run get's him through many historicle paths to a high school football player , to a vietnam war hero where hemeets his good friend Lt. dan who is played by Gary Senise, who does an incredible job who tells Forrest to go for what he want's in life.
2355;but through all this his heart knows only one love his beloved Jenny who besides his mother is the only personthat truly understands him Forest can never forget her and the love story is what keeps this film alive.
2356;good acting all around and an endearing film if you have not seen this movie itis a tearjerker , but for the people who have this by far the best movie Robert Zemekis has ever made add this classic to your collection it's exccelent.
2357;For the greatest price that I was charged.
2358;This movie was really good and entertaining it was such a funny and heartwarming story you can enjoy again and again.
2359;This movie is a must.
2360;Bound to be one of our classics and probably one of Tom Hanks best ones.
2361;keep the good ones coming.
2362;Forrest Gump is one of the best film of all time.
2363;Definitely the best Zemeckis's work so far and he has put so much soul and depth to this 1994 Academy Award winning Best Picture.
2364;The flow and pace of the movie was perfect as we ride through various historical events like the Vietnam War, assasination of JFK and the Watergate Scandal.
2365;Tom Hanks gave an undeniably wonderful performance as Forrest and truly deserves the Oscar that he earned.
2366;Gary Sinise gave a superb performance as Lieutenant Dan in the movie.
2367;Even though he was only nominated and did not win anything, I felt he really deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
2368;Sally Field is also wonderful as Forrest's mother and deserves the Oscar as well.
2369;The line Forrest, you have to do your best what God has given you.
2370;Be brave Forrest, be brave in everything you do.
2371;really moved me and brought me tears.
2372;Robin Wright did her role well as Forrest's love interest and complements well to Forrest's life.
2373;The actors truly brings the characters to life and I must salute Zemeckis for choosing the perfect cast.
2374;The technical aspect of the film is just excellent.
2375;In Forrest Gump, visual effects are utilised to their best to create unbelievable scenes.
2376;This is what visual effects is all about.
2377;Alan Silvestri's film score is one of the best scores I have ever heard.
2378;From the touching piano piece at the beginning feather scene to the uplifting tune of Forrest hugging Jenny at the Washington square scene, Alan's award.
2379;winning score truly brings the perfect mood and emotion to the film.
2380;Every aspect of this movie is simply excellent from the eye.
2381;popping special effects, film editing, wonderful score, sound, to the theme of the movie.
2382;This movie makes us realised that we all have a purpose in life and that we all have the ability to do the impossible.
2383;He believes in God, his momma and Jenny.
2384;pong champion, and a happy father.
2385;Forrest Gump simply tells us that we can achieve anything in life as long as we put our best effort and believe in everything that we do.
2386;Forrest Gump is no doubt one the best films I have ever seen.
2387;It changes my perception of life and makes me realised that we all have a purpose in this world.
2388;Like most folks here, we love this movie.
2389;They were great fun to see again.
2390;While it is a fictional movie, it is set in times all of us remember and events that most saw on television.
2391;This is my favorite movie of any that I have seen in my twenty years.
2392;This movie is a hilarious, emotional, dramatic, and capturing tale of a man with a simple Anti.
2393;Soon enough he runs his way into a great deal of excitement as well as danger.
2394;I was pleasantly surprised when I placed my buttocks upon my seat in the theatre.
2395;The score made me feel part of this movie from the start.
2396;The young actor and actress playing Forest and Jenny started the film off great.
2397;The narration by Tom Hanks worked great from the start as well.
2398;Gary Senise and Robin Wright Penn were very moving as Lt. Dan and the adult Jenny and Bubba was a great character too.
2399;The comedic use of the old cut scenes with the presidents and such were fabulously done technically and worked well as comic relief.
2400;They were designed to merely poke fun at those times.
2401;The real tale of Forest Gump is the romance between Forest Gump and his childhood sweetheart Jenny.
2402;Robert Zemekis pushes all the right buttons when it comes to this aspect of the movie.
2403;The theme is truly a moving one.
2404;Forest's shortsightedness is his greatest strength as well as his greatest weakness.
2405;He becomes rich, a war hero, a famous athlete, and a good citizen capable of providing in his community.
2406;Great service, shipping and great product.
2407;you'll always know what your going to get.
2408;This 2 disc set is worth every penny and the movie on this is priceless.
2409;This is a classic movie and should be in your collection.
2410;Tom Hanks is superb in this role.
2411;humorous as well as heart.
2412;honored romantic stereotype of the saintly fool, a retarded person with a heart of gold.
2413;gump brings his innocence and goodness.
2414;This is a classic story that leverages popular culture and contributes equally to it.
2415;Definitely a must see movie.
2416;The gentle piano accompaniment begins.
2417;And so starts one of the greatest movies of all time.
2418;FORREST GUMP contains almost every theme that makes a great movie: love, friendship, courtship, war, heartbreak, business, diversity, and more.
2419;the title's character is played by loveable Tom Hanks, who serves as both actor and narrator.
2420;Forrest, through time and predicament, chances across many famous people, but what remains the most endearing are the regular people whose lives Forrest has touched: his mother, Jenny, Bubba, and of course, Lieutenant Dan.
2421;It's a love story, it's a history lesson.
2422;Everything combines in a congruent two.
2423;hour moment worth many repeated viewings.
2424;Tom Hanks is outstanding as Forest Gump, and every sapporting actor was perfect for the role.
2425;This movie has so many memorable lines in it, its almost insane.
2426;This movie is almost a modern day Rocky, in which it shows what one man could do with his life, and what we should do with our lives.
2427;Easily deserved every reward it got.
2428;Forrest Gump, to me, is one of the greatest movies of all time.
2429;You get involved with a simple minded man, and see everything through him.
2430;You don't even expect the film to move you that much, but it does, and it takes you by complete surprise.
2431;Tom Hanks is one of the greatest American actors, and personally I do not think that any one else could've even come close to playing that role.
2432;All the suporting cast was vibrant and interesting.
2433;My 17 year old grandson loves this movie and he and I have enjoyed watching it together and learning lessons from the experience!
2434;One of the greatest movies of all time.
2435;wittedness is to contrast more clearly that the thing that brings him success is his goodness.
2436;The prayers of the simple and pure of heart are answered.
2437;And this is the central thing, its the fact that we are each unique and ourselves that makes us worthwhile, not any act or achievement.
2438;True love gives and doesn't expect to be returned.
2439;the feather is having the right attitude to always be able to fly no matter where the wind takes you, to keep your humanity and do what is right no matter what.
2440;Maybe some of the women watching the film will see her journey and arrive at that point a womanhood sooner with happier endings.
2441;a great film, my review above does not do it justice.
2442;My husband and I agree that this is one of the few movies that can be watched over and over again and still love every time!
2443;It also has a great soundtrack!
2444;This is a great movie and once to watch it is not enough.
2445;I've seen it several times and will be watching it again in the future.
2446;Great moments in history are caught when Forrest just happens to be there and he's a part of it by accident.
2447;It's a heartwarming and comical movie that's a great family movie.
2448;It has something for everyone!
2449;It is a modern classic.
2450;Tom hanks delivers a brilliant performance in this movie.
2451;"This movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen
I:8439;2452;The story and the time line in this movie are what I remember in my life thus far.
I:8439;2453;I can watch this movie over and over again and always see something that I hadn't seen before.
I:8439;2454;I really enjoy this movie and I can always enjoy it anytime that I want to now.
I:8439;2455;This movie is simply amazing, and Tom Hanks is definitely the best actor of the century.
I:8439;2456;and Forrest Gump embodies the """"Just turn up"""" principle"
2457;Maybe if more people did this, they might enjoy what they have in life, and get more out of the precious moments we have in life.
2458;without a doubt, this film is superbly entertaining.
2459;If you have a good script, and a Great cast, then all you need is a Zemeckis to create visually good material, and masterful special effects to back it all up.
2460;the end result is that a very moving, dramatic, funny, and ultimately emotional film will result.
2461;"if you find something deep and meaningful in this film, then good for you, and if you find something else in this film, I would question why you would watch a film
I:8439;2462;highly recommended as great entertainment.
I:8439;2463;Tom Hanks is at his best in this movie.
I:8439;2464;The movie is wonderfully made.
I:8439;2465;on what is really important in life.
I:8439;2466;Follow your heart, be truthful, keep your word, and don't let money or fame change who you are as a human being.
I:8439;2467;This movie will last a long time just because generations from now will watch it and see what the past times we like.
I:8439;2468;bottomline: This is a must have for any movie collector and/or Tom Hanks fan (becuase he was great in it)
I:8439;2469;This is an AWESOME movie.
I:8439;2470;Tom Hanks was great in this movie.
I:8439;2471;I was never able to watch this movie.
I:8439;2472;This is one of my Top 5 favorite movies of all time, as I imagine it is for many people.
I:8439;2473;but think back to how much it touched your heart when you first saw it.
I:8439;2474;Then enjoy it like you've never seen it.
I:8439;2475;Phases like a first love, a first day at school, and death.
I:8439;2476;That innocence is what helps draw the audience in and captures each and everyone's heart.
I:8439;2477;Excellent and I enjoy watching it over and over and over again.
I:8439;2478;This movie is quite unlike any you have ever seen.
I:8439;2479;It is a magical mystery tour through the formative times of the baby boom generation, with a simple and guileless man as our guide.
I:8439;2480;Forrest Gump is like the literary character created by Richard Powell, whose """"strength is as the strength of ten because his heart is pure""""."""
2481;The world around him spins like a top, slowly wobbling until it falls, and through it all Forrest's simple character acts like a rudder in the water.
2482;The movie deftly captures this space in time with the perfect blend of music (that just slaps you in the head with its freshness and lack of premeditation) and images that are culled from the back pages of your mind.
2483;i can think of only two other Best Picture examples that compare to Forrest Gump in their appeal, their scope, their grandeur, their humor, their characters, and their place in Hollywood.
2484;note Tom Hanks, but, his face is one of the sweetest images ever captured on film as Forrest Gump.
2485;I hope, for your sake, you enjoy it.
2486;This will grab students' attention and make them want to learn more.
2487;This is the mark of a true classic .
2488;It is for me a movie that will endure and I highly recommend it.
2489;It's story that haunts a person.
2490;this would make a very good gift.
2491;Our 12 year old asked if we could watch this as a family since one of his friends had recently watched the movie with his family.
2492;After the show ended we thanked our son for having us watch this show again after so many years.
2493;I actually think I liked it even better the second time around.
2494;Best movie of all time!
2495;Very well written story and film.
2496;Tom Hanks did very good job.
2497;Not one I can watch over and over, but every few years this one really one calls out to my heart.
2498;This was probably the most perfect.
2499;As part of my son's vietnam war history study, we viewed this movie.
2500;This is so much more than just a review of the 60's.70's.
2501;So many issues touched upon with sensitivity.
2502;It kept my interest from beginning to end, with plenty of laughs, surprises, and excitement.
2503;"Being told from the perspective of a ""slow"" person gives the filmmakers that liberty of telling the story with a child's simplicity and honesty."
2504;The comedy succeeds thanks to Tom Hanks believable acting.
2505;This is an engaging, entertaining, enlightening film, and if you have ClearPlay, I highly recommend it.
2506;Forest Gum is a really good movie and I wanted to have it in my collection, thank you Amazon for having it available for a really good price.
2507;That's all I have to say about that.
2508;Winner of numerous Oscars(including best director.
2509;tom Hanks,and best picture),Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies ever made.
2510;known role)plays Forrest Gump,a man who has limited intelligence,but has a heart of gold.
2511;while watching this film,you will be amazing by the amazing performances,the brillant plot,and the character of Forrest Gump himself,who overcomes his disabilites and becomes a man who will never forget.
2512;It truly is Tom Hanks'best performance(this and Philadelphia,of course).
2513;This film is a masterpiece.
2514;Tom Hanks excels in his role as Forrest Gump and Sally Field is excellent too, as his mother.
2515;This film is moving, yet funny and is the best feel.
2516;Zemeckis' direction is flawless and the story just flows smoothly and fills the audience with joy.
2517;One of the best films ever made.
2518;From the filming techniques to the humor and the tender moments .
2519;this is a classic film for generations to come.
2520;I haven't read the other Amazon reviews but there's really nothing more I can add about this amazing piece of work.
2521;Unique plot filled with glimpses of American history, surprises, good acting and a great soundtrack.
2522;It came in great time for Christmas and was a hit!
2523;For some reason Grandpa loves this!
2524;He thinks it is the funniest thing and quotes it all the time.
2525;movie was in great condition.
2526;this is one of My husbands favorite movies.
2527;Having worked for many years with the mentally retarded I was shocked by Hanks portrayal.
2528;this is the first film I bought for my new Kindle.
2529;its a very good movie my daughter watches it 3.4 times a month,tom hankswas very good in this movie
2530;The film shows about 30 years of his life and our nation's life.
2531;Forrest always manages to be around when something big is going on in America whether it be Vietnam or the Watergate Scandal.
2532;He then joins the army and meets his best friend and shrimp fanatic Bubba.
2533;It is in the hospital that Forrest realizes he is exceptionally skilled in the sport if ping.
2534;forrest Gump is a heart.
2535;moving, and humourous movie that the whole family can watch.
2536;I could never understand why this film was and still is so popular.
2537;This is the best mowie I have seen in fifteen years.
2538;Five stars for direction, story content, and performance all around.
2539;It's mainly a story about how having a solid character and a pure heart can carry someone farther than having intelligence.
2540;This is the sort of movie that people rush to embrace with unconditional acclaim as it covers big, simple themes .
2541;small town underdog comes good, pursues lifelong childhood sweetheart, has an engagingly simple view of complex affairs, wraps up several huge incidents of late 20th Century history in nice bite sized chunks etc. and it is a tearjerker.
2542;It does all of the above, and is heartwarming as well.
2543;This is a movie that traces the life of one man.
2544;All of this is accomplished with relative ease.
2545;There are several sensitive moments during the movie, such as when Forrest crumbles into tears on discovering that he has an illegitimate son.
2546;But these need to be developed far more fully to turn him into a developed hero.
2547;Is that a great story?
2548;And Jenny, his sweetheart suffers the tribulations of the last decades of the 20th Century far more realistically than Forrest.
2549;i am all for huge sentimental, zeitgeist type movies that tell a heartwarming story of a young man who comes good in the end.
2550;Jenny is beautiful and smart, with a father that abuses her.
2551;Forrest's story is told in a great way.
2552;It's sweet and sad and truly moving.
2553;Even though Forrest is not especially bright, there is plenty of wisdom in all that he does.
2554;As he says, he's not a smart man, but he knows what love is.
2555;As with many of my other favourite films (Truman Show, Trainspotting etc) this one is great due to the meaning and depth involved.
2556;At the start Forrest is a boy who is 'simple' yet by the end of the film he has led an extraordinary life, including inspiring Elvis' dances, seeing the first wave of coloured student at his college, won the College Bowl single.
2557;handedly, fought in Vietman, ran a shrimping company in honour of his best friend, and produced a bright and happy son.
2558;It is certainly funny in places as well, especially little comments in the narrative like Forrest's childlike innocent reference to Jenny being abused, completely not understanding it.
2559;The way he chases after Jenny like a lovesick schoolboy is touching.
2560;This is a legendary piece of cinema.
2561;Forrest Gump is rightly acknowledged as a superior film, brilliant in every way, maybe even flawless.
2562;It's touch your heartI saw this move few times but each time I see it I enjoyed
2563;It is a movie entrenched with multiple human emotions and themes: compassion, empathy, happiness, sadness and hilarion wrapped in a blanket of human dignity.
2564;old movie, the plot of human conditions the movie portrays never age, which speaks to the movie's endeavor to send a powerful message of tolerance and acceptance.
2565;It is an excellent, ageless movie.
2566;Highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.
2567;Awesome, love the box of chocolates and oh how true that saying is!!
2568;Tom Hanks does another excellent job in this timeless classic.
2569;Few movies as nice as this one bothered me as much as this one.
2570;It is a very distinctive movie, with a unique structure and content.
2571;And if it *is* your cup of tea, great.
2572;It made me laugh and it made me cry.
2573;Just a feel good movie.
2574;It's a super movie and very clever how they put Forrest into clips of real events.
2575;I absolutely love this movie, and have since I first saw it a decade ago.
2576;I have tried to figure out why I love it so much .
2577;and really it's the whole package.
2578;I love it's humor, the acting, the dialogue, the unique attractiveness of the main characters.
2579;I really believe Tom Hanks can do just about anything.
2580;He was amazing in this role.
2581;The thing I love the most about this movie was his sincere love for his childhood friend.
2582;It's about truth, honesty and love.
2583;it always uplifts me and makes me feel good.
2584;I recommend it for anyone with a heart, and that's just about everyone, isn't it?
2585;This is a great movie.
2586;Forest Gump: A simple love of a very profound veteran.
2587;Watch it a few times and you will see what I'm talking about.
2588;i give it only 4 STARS and most of those go to Zemeckis for his direction of a film that really takes you in some many directions, and work each time.YES, you have to be an idiot not to know its PURE HOLLYWOOD, but so what?
2589;You can admit you like these types of films, but still love cult, underground, independent, foreign films etc.
2590;It's a movie of life, death, victory, failure, love, hare, anger etc. and it manages to encompass all of those emotions well.
2591;For those who criticize it, go make your movie and see how yours turn out.
2592;its a classic for a reason so just get it already!
2593;This is my all time favorite movie.
2594;It has love, humor, action, adventure, tragedy, and every other genre imaginable.
2595;This film is a work of pure genius, and no wonder it has been nominated for soo many awards.
2596;tom Hanks shines as the dim.
2597;the film follows Forrest through an inspiring journey from his childhood in the 50's through his college years and Vietnam in the 60's, to his admirably successful shrimping business venture and settling down with a family which concludes in the early 80's.
2598;And throughout this incredible journey, Forrest has no clue how great a person he is and becomes.
2599;we get to share history as it unfolds with Forrest through the simple mind of Forrest himself.
2600;forrest Gump will take you along on his thrilling, funny, and sometimes sad trip through his very simple but stunning life, and you will be unable to pull away from it, not even for a minute.
2601;another important feature in the film is the soundtrack which covers each period with the songs that defined the era.
2602;Love how this show has all the up and downs.
2603;This is one of my husbands favorite movies.
2604;I absolutely love this movie!
2605;It is my favorite movie of all time!
2606;thank you to amazon prime, look forward to watching more movies on amazon!
2607;My 10 year old daughter is just getting into Tom Hanks as an actor and she loved Forrest Gump!
2608;It is trulyone of our rare Tom Hanks gems!
2609;He is so versatile and talented!
2610;We are so fortunate and blessed to have him among our generation.
2611;To my surprise, this is a very brilliant movie!
2612;I am also a fan of Tom Hanks and I do think that this is his best movie.
2613;The characters are played so well and its so real, you could easily feel their emotions.
2614;It's dramma, comedy, and more all mixed in one.
2615;I agree with the other reviewers, that everyone must see it!
2616;It's one of those unforgettable films.
2617;but I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in whole wide world.
2618;But the character of Forrest speaks to more than just one single generation, or even one single man or one journey.
2619;Whilethe bookis a worthy and interesting read, the film trumps.
2620;This movie is definitely a classic and I'd suggest this movie to anyone.
2621;One of my favorite Tom Hanks movies.
2622;That's all I have to say about that.
2623;I will continue to watch movies using Amazon.
2624;This movie is one of the best.
2625;The casting of Robin Wright as Jenny was also excellent.
2626;If you are looking for the perfect feel good movie this is the one!!
2627;To think that Forrest did all of those things is sometimes hard to imagine, but overall still an excellent watch.
2628;This is a Christmas present for one of my family member and they love watching movies with their familys A
2629;I have a GUMP approach to life and let's just say that I have one amazing life.
2630;I love the director .
2631;Robert Z because he directs in a way that elegant .
2632;simple communication that reaches all audiences.
2633;I've seen this movie at least 20 times and will watch it many more times.
2634;It's fun, emotional and witty.
2635;Robert Zemeckis and the writters did an outstanding job at weaving Forrest Gump's story with American History.
2636;And there are more memorable quotes from this movie than I can count.
2637;This is Tom Hanks at his best.
2638;Clearly one of the finest movies ever made.
2639;While not deserving of video 'DEMO status', the video transfer was quite good.
2640;i didn't have time to watch all the extras, and there are a great many, but I did watch the 6 or 7 screen tests which were very enjoyable and charming.
2641;This movie is a timeless classic.
2642;We enjoy watching this movie regularly.
2643;The hole family can enjoy watching this movie.
2644;This is one of the best movies of all time.
2645;It is a beautiful depiction of American history, with brilliant acting by Tom Hanks that will pull at the heartstrings of even the most hardened people.
2646;I'd recommend it to anyone.
2647;This is my all time favorite film.
2648;I have always loved this movie ever since the day I saw it in the theatres!
2649;This is a wonderful film with wonderful performances and a great cast!
2650;I love all of the characters in this movie.
2651;There are many memorable moments in this film and they will never be forgotten!
2652;I also have the soundtrack and it is also great.
2653;The second disc is the one which holds most of the special features.
2654;You get to see the screen tests of Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the kids that played Forrest and Jenny as children, deleted scenes, a making of feature, and much, much more!
2655;This movie will always be the best!
2656;Nice inspiring story of free spirited dreaming, fate and luck in life.
2657;Nice mix of both serious drama and comedy.
2658;Historical overtones bring you down memory lane.
2659;On the other hand, it's entertaining, funny, and even wise.
2660;Somehow looking at the sophisticated world through the eyes of the unsophisticated Forrest Gump makes this story work and offers a refreshing look at things.
2661;Forrest offers the perspective of someone not trapped in that struggle, in contrast to the struggles of Lt. Dan and Jenny, and shows us how simple love and acceptance can create a life of profound meaning, purpose, and happiness.
2662;Each time is as good as the first time.
2663;So many great performances from this movie, from great actors and actresses.
2664;"Robert Zemeckis' ""Forrest Gump"" is a spirited venture that gets off to a dazzling start but is torpedoed by a second half that is mundane and sappy."
2665;nature and his honesty along with a series of strange twists lead him to fame and glory as a sports star, a war hero, a successful businessman, and a celebrity.
2666;Yet, even with so much going on around him, it is always the wisdom of his mother and his love for Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) that is foremost on his mind.
2667;Forrest Gump is best when it follows Forrest in his journey through history.
2668;Watching him partake in some of the most important events of the 20th century and seeing him interact with such real.
2669;life figures as George Wallace, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and John Lennon reminds one of just how magical the film medium can be.
2670;This movie is great and is almost considered a classic!
2671;I would highly recommend owning this movie.
2672;I had not seen this movie in a long time but It is just as good as I remember it.
2673;Gary Sinese was great as Lt. Dan and Tom Hanks did his usual good acting.
2674;This is my absolute favorite movie of all time.
2675;Each time I watch it not only do I notice something new, but it touches me in a new and more significant way.
2676;I think Forrest's life long devotion to his best friend Jenny is touching and shows what a true friend should be.
2677;I think that it is important for everyone to see this just for thata spect.
2678;As well, it is a an important look at modern history through music and action.
2679;"A much more credible performance about a mentally challenged person is given in the excellent movie: ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."""
2680;Forrest Gump is just a mildly entertaining fantasy.
2681;If you lived through the crazy, turbulent '60's, you will love this movie!
2682;Forest Gump, the central character is born with physical and mental issues which he overcomes with the help of his mother, his childhood sweetheart, (Holly), and the friendship of two fellow marines.
2683;Because Forest takes verbal comments literally to heart and never gives up, he unwitt
2684;When I fist saw Forrest Gump I thought it was a true story.
2685;lol But every movie that I watch and like I question if it a true story.
2686;This is a heartwarming, sweet, sad, joyful story.
2687;Makes you laugh, makes you cry.
2688;This 1996 film has to be the best epic of all times.
2689;Not only did it win an Academy Award for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), but also Best Picture, plus three other Academy Awards.
2690;Next it takes us through three decades of Forrest's life, from the 1950's through the 1980's.
2691;I give this movie five stars because it has managed to include action, love, comedy, a little bit of history, and a whole lot of heart and soul.
2692;If so then you will love all 142 minutes of Forrest Gump.
2693;This movie is so special in its ability to uplift.
2694;It is the best movie to watch if you happen to be feeling down.
2695;It's the kind of movie that re.
2696;charges you and makes you feel lucky to just be alive.
2697;The cast is incredibly well suited for the characters in the story.
2698;Cinematography is superb in every way.
2699;It delivers its message with a conbination of tragedy, humor and drama.
2700;Very deserving of all the awards is recieved.
2701;Forrest Gump is another all time classic.
2702;Fast streaming excellent viewing experience.
2703;Good yearly bargain compare to netflix as you get multiple benefits with 80 bucks prime membership.
2704;The wonderful story would make anyone seem good, but Tom Hanks kicks it right threw the uprights with his wonderful, talented turn as the title character.
2705;"It is just a great ""feel good"" movie."
2706;Every I know loves it.
2707;My husband imitates Forrest every now and then and gets people at ease and laughing.
2708;It is an American Icon!
2709;Tom hanks is an incredible actor.
2710;A great movie for everyone.
2711;I'm a big fan of Tom Hanks and I thought he did a superb job of playing Forrest Gump.
2712;Great movie and even greater sound track.
2713;Hard to believe how old this movie is, and yet still so timeless!!!
2714;Forrest Gump is a great story teller.
2715;It not only tells the story of one man's adventure.
2716;But the entire story of growing up American.
2717;This is a great movie to watch with the family.
2718;He really liked the movie and so did the rest of the family.
2719;Tom Hanks is awesome as always.
2720;How do I begin to describe one of them most incredible films of the last 50 years.
2721;But I will do my best to tell you how this movie has affected me.
2722;Every one of you has seen this film.
2723;The whole world has seen this film.
2724;and simply sees the world `as it is', and yearns for the love of his life, his Jenny.
2725;In fact, everything he does, is driven by his love for Jenny.You will never EVER see a better performance by Gary Sinese, as the physically and severely soul wounded Lt. Dan.
2726;EVERYTHING he has done since this movie, is compared to this role.
2727;Robin Wright Penn will never have a role as perfect as she had as Jenny, the woman he has loved since childhood, but shuns him repeatedly, in search of her own life.
2728;Well, he is one of the premier actors of the modern era, and his performance in Forest Gump eclipses even his role in `The Green Mile' (my other favorite film).
2729;In the end, he finally get's his life's desire, and hears the words he waited for his whole life, from Jenny.
2730;But we get a glimpse of a whole new beginning in his life, with his son (played by Haley Joel Osment).
2731;Not only will it enthrall you, it may just make you a better person.
2732;Everyone should see this movie.
2733;It is a great movie.
2734;One that makes you think about a lot of things in life.
2735;Great movie for a Sunday afternoon or any time
2736;The book was actually very funny, but i thought that this moviemanaged to leave out all the good laughs from the book.
2737;Read the book,you will enjoy it a lot more.
2738;A well acted movie with just the right amount of humor and pathos.
2739;For those of us that lived through the 60's and 70's, it is a trip through memory lane.
2740;The John Lennon clip is a classic.
2741;I am not one that likes to watch many movies more than once, but this is one that is always a treat to see again.
2742;If you like Tom Hanks then you will love this movie.
2743;He was very happy with it and I was happy with the price.
2744;It makes you happy, sad and everything in between.
2745;Still one of my favorite movies!
2746;Even though it's a bit longer than most, this is one for the movie appreciation classes of the future!
2747;this one reminds me of Citizen Kane and the lengths Orson Welles went through to create a movie for the ages.
2748;All of our fav songs, over the decades.
2749;As usual wonderful performance by Tom Hanks, and the story draws you in from the first minute all the way through the closing scene.
2750;Wonderful film to watch and re.
2751;Suddenly this Christmas friends of mine roped in into sitting through Forrest Gump and I was shocked by how much I absolutely loved this movie.
2752;the movie is vivid fictionalized but oddly realistic life seen through (disabled kid) Forrest Gump's eyes.
2753;It is true watching life unfold through Forrest Gump's eyes offers a perspective that leaves you altered for the better if you have any heart and soul at all.
2754;In my eyes a truly good movie uses fiction to teach truth in ways that leaves an audience stronger better and more enlightened and in all these measures Forrest Gump excels so completely as to have no equals in its job of putting 1960's life with disability in honest perspective.
2755;This is a strong candidate for my all.
2756;"He makes us cry
I:8439;2757;I can't answer for what he'll make you think, but I know he will challenge you.
I:8439;2758;hearted approach to life is inspiring like nothing else.
I:8439;2759;Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise both give good performances(Sinise especially for acting like a Nam weathered loon), the effects are cool, though oddly out of place in a sentimental comedy drama like this, and it does have that hollywood blockbuster polish that is so attractive to us cinematic crows.
I:8439;2760;a little long but funny.
I:8439;2761;the end is not as good as the first part but overall you could have a fantastic time watching it
I:8439;2762;On the one hand, he's perfectly likeable in, say, Road To Perdition, oozes charm in, say, Big, but then there are times you could happily run him over with a car.
I:8439;2763;Castaway is a good example, but surely the best example has to be this .
I:8439;2764;Tom Hanks thinks playing someone who is mentally slow equals having big wide eyes and, er, well, that's pretty much it.
I:8439;2765;The humourous coincidences throughout the movie.

2767;run along there, that's it.
2768;"pushing ""Pulp Fiction"" of the Best Picture Oscar."
2769;"pleaser, then by all means, ""Gump"" will be your cup of tea."
2770;This is an excellent movie.
2771;Tom Hanks does an excellent acting performance.
2772;Gary Sinese is also a great representative for military members.
2773;A great story and a fantastic cast, I'll watch over and over again I'm sure now that I have Amazon Prime.
2774;About once a year, I watch this unique and heartwarming film to experience the sorrow and joy and beauty of life.
2775;And each year, Forrest Gump proves itself abundantly deserving of both its Academy Award for Best Picture and its status as an amazon.
2776;hearted and physically gifted Southerner.
2777;Ultimately, it is a love story that, both throughout and in its sublime conclusion, dares to address the issue of free will versus predestination.
2778;(And does so more successfully than any film.
2779;Tom Hanks enters an amazing, tour de force performance, actually becoming the slow.
2780;cast Gary Sinise shine in memorable supporting roles.
2781;a remarkable combination of original music, period.
2782;evoking songs, and haunting silence.
2783;is one of the best in recent memory.
2784;is simply inspired, a work of magic.
2785;i've seen this film several times now, and each time I can only cry at its evocation of life's essence, even as I smile thereafter.
2786;Highly recommended and very much worth owning and sharing.
2787;I have seen a lot of movies, and among those a lot of great ones ( Almost Famous , Face/Off , What Dreams May Come ) but I am very confident in saying that this is the greatest movie I have ever seen.
2788;This movie is very much like a window into real life.
2789;The characters are all presented in fine form, and the acting is off the charts.
2790;Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of all time, up there with Robin Williams and Nicolas Cage.
2791;Each viewing is like a thrilling journey, and even though you know where it's going, you can't wait to get there.
2792;You've got comedy, action, drama, this movie transcends genres.
2793;It is truly a masterpiece of film.
2794;One of my favorites for sure!
2795;Most enjoyable movie and a small history lesson to boot!
2796;A great American story with masterful acting and a hard edge at times.
2797;I loved the role of Lt. Dan!
2798;This film will make you laugh and make you cry.
2799;"The cinematography is excellant
I:8439;2800;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8439;2801;Love the soundtrack and Tom Hanks is terrific (so is rest of the cast).
I:8439;2802;classic with great story, interesting characters and amazing view into history.
I:8439;2803;The special effects with historical footage is amazing.
I:8439;2804;This movie is touching, funny, exciting, and sad.
I:8439;2805;I hope this review helped.
I:8439;2806;Winning Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor, Forrest Gump speaks for itself as one of the best movies.
I:8439;2807;From there it turns into a love story with a new meaning.
I:8439;2808;The movie ends with a good feeling and a brief history lesson from the 1950's to then present day 1994, when the movie was released.
I:8439;2809;This is a documentary with a new spice and flavor to it that I highly recommend.
I:8439;2810;After watching this movie, you have a good feeling and some new sayings from Forrest Gump, who is a family orientated film.
I:8439;2811;I give it an A+.
I:8439;2812;Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career as """"Forrest Gump."""""""
2813;The director, Robert Zemeckis was creative and brilliant with his vision.
2814;Ran away from bullies, fought in Vietnam, got shot in the but.
2815;tocks, met the president, played ping.
2816;If you look at my shoes, you'll see dirt and dog stuff all over them.
2817;The movie is very inspirational.
2818;Tom Hanks does a superb job.
2819;It ingeniously ties in history with Gump's life.
2820;the old songs are really enjoyable.
2821;He's one of the best actors who ever lived.
2822;What will leave you watching this is Forrest's good heart.
2823;What is also entertaining is how he tells the people he sits with on the bus.
2824;If after you see this movie you don't feel an appreciation for life knowing that their are people as gentle, and kind as Forrest Gump, and don't wish to move to a town as charming and rural as 'Greenbo', then, well.
2825;As everyone should know by now that this is the best movie of its time.
2826;Tom Hanks is an awesome actor.
2827;I loved this movie the first time I saw it and still love it now.
2828;The performances by Tom Hanks, Gary Sinese and Sally Fields are superb.
2829;A good film for the entire family.
2830;Still holds up 20 years later.
2831;Great performances and the special effects still amaze.
2832;It's time to see it again.
2833;This movie has a wonderful plot, great music and actors, and serves as a walkthrough history.
2834;the ways Tom Hanks life was woven into the old films was marvelous.
2835;I've had more fun watching grass grow.
2836;I know that Tom Hanks is very talented and Robert Zemeckis is an accomplished directer, but what were these two thinking.
2837;I can watch this movie a 1000 times and it never gets old.
2838;I recently watched with my kids and it still is one of my favorites.
2839;I really dont know what i love more, the book or the movie.
2840;Forrest Gump was one of the most distinguished and classic films of my lifetime.
2841;This movie is a must for any american history buff.
2842;A simple man who experiences an unbelievably full life.
2843;Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance!The way the writer works in past events from actual history is classic, and keeps you very interested in the script.
2844;You will absolutely pleased at how he winds everything together!This is a great movie that everyone should own!
2845;tom hanks is a top.
2846;The sweetest of love stories, philosophically profound, deep as the ocean and light as a feather.
2847;It's predominantly a `serious' film about a dim headed, yet good hearted southern boy and how the absence of a dysfunctional ego and a simple sense of honor and integrity enables him to flow through life effortlessly, like the metaphor of the white feather we see at the beginning and the end of the film.
2848;forrest Gump is a masterfully written and directed tale that punctuates deep philosophical substance with a good deal of humor .
2849;Actual film clippings from various historical events are cleverly edited to enable Forrest to step into them and interact.
2850;it's kind of a nod to the `Wonder Years'.
2851;as richly entertaining as Forrest's life is, and as very funny as many of the scenes are, it's still the character of Forrest that carries the move.
2852;You become significantly invested in his life.
2853;And you admire his quiet acceptance of 'what is'.
2854;his simple open heartedness and sense of personal integrity which he carries through life are inspirational.
2855;This clearly is a story that shows the ultimate triumph of virtue over the complex dysfunctions of the mind.
2856;always looking somewhere else for love, although she finds it on her death bed And Lt. Dan is just an awesome character.
2857;His 360 degree turn through what life deals him is as inspirational as Forrest's.
2858;the closing scene is the most memorable for me.
2859;In 1994, FORREST GUMP raised a ruckuss for winning 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture .
2860;and it deserved each and every one of those awards.
2861;"The special effects are so absolutely flawless it's as if Gump truly was at those events
I:8439;2862;The soundtrack is also awesome, and adds to the atmosphere of the events at which Gump is present.
I:8439;2863;Hanks is at his best, and gives a truly moving performance"
2864;The end scene, with Gump and Lt. Dan meeting before Gump's meeting, is a real moving moment.
2865;"There is also some lighthearted comedy at moments when you need it most
I:8439;2866;Of course, there's also excellent directing by Zemeckis"
2867;The movie is rightfully so considered a classic.
2868;Well yes I liked this movie and would recommend it.
2869;Forrest Gump guarantees to be one of the greatest movies you ever see.
2870;forrest is a simple man who lives by his beliefs, and lives by his mother's advice.
2871;this is a truly inspirational movie, one of humour and light.
2872;hearted fun, while looking back at some of America's biggest moments.
2873;tom Hanks richly deserved Best Actor, as did the film deserve Best Picture, and Forrest Gump is one of the least.
2874;This film really can say that it will make you laugh and cry, as well as thoroughly enjoying the best movie of its decade.
2875;very good special features on this well.
2876;Informatice commentaries and documentary, as well as insights to the production team and other visual goodies!Forrest Gump is a must have movie, and is one to watch many times!
2877;This is one of the best movies ever made.
2878;I've seen it about 7 times and I will watch it again.
2879;A great movie and a great watch.
2880;Tom Hanks does an amazing job portraying a mentally challenged man with a lifetime of events that he has faced.
2881;A great movie, combining so many reasons to watch.
2882;a love story, a story of love, loss and winning, and also many small bits of humor and life lessons.
2883;i also liked the throw back music to the 60's, when I was a young girl.
2884;a true classic to watch again and again through the years.
2885;This has to be one of the greatest films I've ever seen.
2886;Great special effects and greater acting, Tom Hanks is the best.
2887;We all love the fact that we can review movies on Amazon, it's really cool to be able to give our own 2 cents on our favorite movies.
2888;Rivkah Maccaby, are you also a filmmaker?
2889;So many other reviewers have already done it pretty darn good.
2890;however, I can tell you that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this motion picture.
2891;An absolutely great picture that is a must see.
2892;This is a movie to own!
2893;Not sweet Forrest, who seems (on the surface at least) to personify all that is good and humble and admirable in the world.
2894;don't get me wrong: Forrest is a good man.
2895;Can we agree that in an ideal world, a film (like any work of art) will express a view of life which is truthful?
2896;at its best, a Hollywood film can be riveting and inspirational: look at To Kill a Mockingbird, Singing in the Rain, or Mary Poppins, for example.
2897;"In ""Singing in the Rain,"" the plucky and talented prevail."
2898;spend a lifetime bringing joy to millions.
2899;don't get me wrong: the idea of a wise fool is wonderful.
2900;now I love sitting on porch swings.
2901;And everywhere I've gone I've met good people.
2902;"into ""the arena"" in Teddy Roosevelt's words."
2903;We are a nation of pioneers.
2904;And it reinforces the correctness of the decision to escape from our destiny by telling viewers they made the right decision not to get involved.
2905;in the market driven America of today, a product is good if it reinforces the idea that the consumer is good.
2906;Therefore, a movie is good if it makes the viewer feel good.
2907;a wide variety of human characteristics.
2908;"And all he needed to get the girl was Robin Williams weeping over him and uttering the magic words: ""You're really good!"
2909;They don't have to: they're perfect just the way they are.
2910;"naturally the Consumer Creature will call a movie ""good"" if it allows him/her to remain in the bubble of their shallowness."
2911;Viewed in this way, Forrest Gump is the Moby Dick of this generation.
2912;It is the white whale of shallowness, and, I'm afraid, it will take us all to the bottom of the ocean.
2913;Meanwhile, the future historians will look at Forrest in the pantheon of great characters in literature (Lear, Hamlet, Ahab.
2914;finn, Gump) and marvel at the capacity of the human being to rise.
2915;"This is the American version of ""Triumph of the Will,"" the moment when it became practically illegal to have a mind."
2916;the proper heroes of a film about that time are the men and women who fought in Vietnam.
2917;This is a must see for everyone!
2918;Tom Hanks brings to life a character that showed the best of humanity.
2919;There is no better film IMHO than Forrest Gump!
2920;I watched this movie again with my 16 year old son, and it just gets better every time I watch.
2921;My son absolutely loved the film.
2922;The title character leads viewers through an accidental travelogue of American social history from the early 1960s through the present in this revisionist fable.
2923;Best film ever made to simply put it in words.
2924;It has everything from a good plot to good music to accompany.
2925;The man is just stunning in his perfomance in this movie.
2926;"No matter what your preference in movies
I:8439;2927;forrest Gump covers them all, splendidly.
I:8439;2928;The film won numerous awards, too many to mention here, but topping the list were Oscars won for Best Actor, Best Picture and Best Effects.
I:8439;2929;The film follows Tom Hanks as a young boy named Forrest, with just a bit of a learning disibility, and his life growing up.
I:8439;2930;Along the way, he runs into many characters, some well known, and in one form or another, slightly or greatly impacts the lives of each one.
I:8439;2931;This film deserves 5 stars across the board for its power to make you laugh, cry, learn and hope!
I:8439;2932;Timeless story of the power of love and the journey of a man discovering his life.
I:8439;2933;Forrest is the only really likable character, because of his innocence.
I:8439;2934;The director did a really great job of touching base on a lot of really impacting events of the 20th century.
I:8439;2935;A good movie to watch if you're feeling patriotic.
I:8439;2936;I really liked how they weaved Forrest into the history of the shaping of modern America.
I:8439;2937;As I said, this is a really well done movie with great acting, but it seems very long.
I:8439;2938;an autobiography, history, comedy, war film, but at its heart lies an allegorical sort of epitaph for a wild era in American history (1960s.70s)"
2939;and this seems to apply aptly here.
2940;His saintly character seems at one level to be a stunning example of some writer's indictment by contrast of American culture.
2941;"Bubba, ""Lt. Dan"", Jenny, are tragic ones."
2942;And if our explorations in life bring us back to that place where we started, if complexity's chaos and confusion become brittle and melt into love, it is also true that love compels us to live life nonetheless, to pursue our dreams and fly as far as we can.
2943;(Even if only so that perhaps one day, we may look back again at what we had at the beginning with understanding eyes, and know it for the first time).
2944;The image is very sharp in a widescreen version, and the colors are highly realistic.
2945;Disk #2 has all the extras , and lots of interesting ones at that.
2946;They really go into all the secrets of making the film.
2947;"History is one thing when it's told in a book, it's something amazing when it's told by ""Forrest Gump"" The incredible story of the good hearted low IQ man from Alabama and his the highlights of his life that made him famous."
2948;The Story also follows his personal life with his mother, his friends Dan Taylor and Bubba Blue and the love of his life since childhood, Jenny.
2949;One of the most extrodonary, inspiring movies of all time, terrific entertainment, a top notch classic, brilliant, Hanks is the greatest actor of this age.
2950;Winner of 6 Academy including Best Picture, Best Actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis.
2951;This is one of my favorite films of all time.
2952;i enjoy watching over and over!!!
2953;This is a must see.
2954;It is a complete well produced movie.
2955;A great movie to watch when you have nothing else to do.
2956;Even the kids liked it, even though I forgot about some parts that weren't to great for them to watch.
2957;It's one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2958;Superb acting, unusual story, humor: doesn't get much better than this.
2959;I chose this rating because I love this movie and someday I think it will be a classic.
2960;It's a very good portrayal of Forest Gump by Tom Hanks.
2961;The disk I received was in perfect condition however.
2962;Forrest manages to do what many strive for but few achieve: maintaining a life of peace and simplicity in even the most tumultuous circumstances.
2963;I loved this movie because Forrest was not discouraged by other, no matter how people treated him.
2964;one of the best ever movies.
2965;It is transcendant, it offers hope, and it shows how big God's heart really is.
2966;I've cried my way through it and laughed my way through for years .
2967;Know what I mean?Hey, I bought the sound track and listen to it when I exercise.
2968;Awesome story and fabulous acting by everyone.
2969;I would love to watch it once again.
2970;good movie you can ever watch.
2971;tom Hanks has played the character exceptionally well and I bet there was no other actor who could've played his part.
2972;He was the best guy they could choose for the role.
2973;greatest movie for almost 20 years, can watch again and again, great video streaming, one of the best oscar winners ever
2974;Every time you see this movie you will notice things you never noticed before.
2975;And you'll be impressed with Tom Hanks.
2976;It mixes a great story with historical facts.
2977;You will like this movie and watch it many times.
2978;Not only a great movie and great acting, give a great history lesion for the 60s though 90s, fun to see the way we where and ware we came from.
2979;its just worth my time.
2980;This a great movie to watch.
2981;Tom Hanks was great and so was Salley Field.
2982;Would recommend it to all my friends.
2983;I cry every time I watch this movie, and realize something new and charge myself with motivation when I need it.
2984;The oft quoted golden line Life is full of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get is just truer than ever, and on this particular viewing .
2985;Happiness is when you appreciate and accept, and be strong in all circumstances even when it is tough .
2986;i do remember the movie !
2987;Very talanted , very funny , very smart , very unpredictable !
2988;I know its a long movie, but its so good that you won't even notice how long it is.
2989;Forrest, the archetypal innocent brilliantly played by Tom Hanks, teaches us to see the world anew.
2990;and what we learn is both enchanting and disenchanting.
2991;The film romps through three decades of the late 20th century, revealing the foibles of those times but also some of their finest potential.
2992;Forrest's run back and forth across the country is hilarious.
2993;forrest's modesty makes space for my favorite character in the film: the magnificent Captain Dan (Gary Sinise), who Ahab.
2994;and in the process proves both the resilience of the human spirit (and invites us to laugh at its pretensions).
2995;yuck), but given its overall achievement, it can be forgiven.
2996;loved this move never gets old could watch it over and over and never get tired of it still laugh and cry
2997;This is my favorite movie.
2998;I believe it's Tom Hanks best performance.
2999;Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors ever, and the rest of the cast as well.
3000;This is, without a doubt, Robin Wright's finest role, and the magnificent Gary Sinese absolutely earned his Academy award.
3001;Sally Field of course was wonderful as well, and let's give a little kudos to the actor who played Bubba!There were a few 'bad' reviews on this site about this movie.
3002;And that's all I have to say about THAT!
3003;this is a wonderful movie!
3004;the movie won a total of 6 Academy Awards.
3005;Very entertaining with lots of insights.
3006;Tom Hanks as a lovable simpleton who tells us about his life and adventures with humor love and grace a must see classic film
3007;Can't believe I didn't already have this movie, as it is one of the best of all time.
3008;One of the few great movies in the last 20 years.
3009;This will be a film that a 100 years from now will be still a classic.
3010;Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and he nails it in this movie!
3011;this is an exceptional movie.
3012;I haven't actually watched it in a while, but when I do, I'm moved every time.
3013;"Never has this truth been so accurately portrayed as in this wonderful movie, ""Forrest Gump."""
3014;Is he smart, or is he. . . .?
3015;That scene clinched the Oscar for Tom Hanks, and I still can't watch it without getting a big lump in my throat and tears in my eyes.
3016;Tom Hanks is the best, most versatile actor of our time, and never has he been more brilliant than he was in this movie.
3017;Favorite all time movie!Tom Hanks is great.
3018;Great relation to historical events.
3019;favorite all time movie!Tom Hanks is great.
3020;Great relation to historical events.
3021;favorite all time movie!Tom Hanks is great.
3022;Great relation to historical events.
3023;This review may contain spoilers!Forrest Gump: An Inspiring movie during the time of the Vietnam WarSet in the time of the Vietnam War, Robert Zemeckis directs a heartwarming movie, Forrest Gump.
3024;Like no other, this movie has become a cultural phenomenon in our society today.
3025;He uses that money to invest in an entire fleet of shrimp boats, and Lieutenant Dan invests the money in Apple electronics.
3026;One day he gets a call, to find that his mother is dying and he returns home to say his final goodbye.
3027;He becomes famous in three and a half years.
3028;When he meets Jenny, he realizes that Jenny is with a son, and that he is the father to the baby.
3029;The three move together, and Forrest and Jenny eventually marry.
3030;characters and Actors:Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, portrays the main character as an innocent and lovable person.
3031;tom Hanks is without a doubt the best choice for this role.
3032;Hanks not only act the part, but also become the character and made it more believable with the Southern accent than ever.
3033;Hanks delivers the role with such brilliance that it sets a new standard for everyone.
3034;having only acted in a few movies prior to Forrest Gump, Robin Wright, who plays Jenny Curran, portrays the actor in a surprisingly outstanding performance.
3035;Jenny is a woman that is very important in Forrest's life.
3036;She gives Forrest the strength and happiness we see in Forrest every time he sees her.
3037;Though Wright's performance all took us by surprise, Hank still outshines as the greatest role.
3038;After the war, we realize that he is actually a compassionate and altruistic.
3039;historical AccuracyThis movie is set in the 20th Century.
3040;Forrest Gump gives the audience a view of what it is like before, with great accuracy.
3041;After all, the Vietnam War is the greatest and longest war in all of the United States history.
3042;another accurate accuracy was the rise of popularity of Nixon.
3043;The film accurately portrays this scene of history.
3044;warming, well acted, and Oscar winning movie.
3045;This movie not only contains historical accuracy, but it also teaches us a life moral.
3046;There can be only little improvements to this movie, but otherwise, it was a great movie, that is suitable for any ages.
3047;One of the best pictures made in recent years on two discs and is loaded with extras.
3048;It can make you laugh, cry and take a look at your own life, seeing the things you need to change and also counting your blessings.
3049;Each time I watch it, I see something new.
3050;Still somehow it managed to win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction And The Shawshank Redemption in 1994.
3051;Nobodys Fool, Quiz Show, The Lion King, and the list goes on.
3052;But arounf Back to the Future 2 I thought Zemekis started to rely to much on special effects and it shows on this film.
3053;It is the story of our daily life and how we face other human beings with all the challenges is in this cruel world.
3054;Forrest Gump will surely touch your heart, soul and mind.
3055;ray), I love this Film and it moves me everytime I see it, no wonder it won 6 Academy Awards, it looks Awesome in Blu.
3056;ray and the sound is so spectacular coming from my Sony Speakers.
3057;141 minutes filled with most memorable events of the second half of the 20th Century.
3058;I had this movie in VHS format but donated it to a local library.
3059;about the Vietnam war, the friendship between Forrest and Bubba, the love between Forrest and Jenny, the respect Forrest finally earns from Lieutenant Dan .
3060;a panorama of human emotions, especially love and friendship.
3061;Even though I've seen this movie many times, I enjoy it so much!
3062;The acting is great and the storyline is fascinating.
3063;This is one of those movies that you want to see again and again.
3064;It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.
3065;It will move you through the gut.
3066;This movie is about the triumph of one human spirit, against great odds.
3067;Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all.
3068;Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing).
3069;Forrest Gump is hugely entertaining on every level.
3070;It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements.
3071;It's true that the picture exagerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life.
3072;Focus on those gifts and master them.
3073;Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e. g. Jenny, Bubba and Lt. Dan).
3074;Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.
3075;"Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i. e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you)
I:8439;3076;from Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation.
I:8439;3077;out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL.
I:8439;3078;The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!)
I:8439;3079;Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness"
3080;Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful.
3081;"Remember: ""One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor."
3082;Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiance at Gump's wedding.
3083;Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple.
3084;(This is great acting on Sinise's part).
3085;Forrest Gump is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels.
3086;Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two.
3087;The first one is the movie and the second one are the special features.
3088;the special Features disc is completely amazing.
3089;I'm happy because I got it and the price I paid is more than good.
3090;Forrest Gump is definitely one of those movies.
3091;Tom Hanks, undoubtedly one of the top actors worldwide, puts on a brilliant performance, with a perfectly retarded drawl (or at least I thought so).
3092;But his good heart and simple understanding of things helps him live a life we all envy.
3093;Gump is present at so many historical events that it keeps our interest and the fact that Gump witnesses all these events and has no clue about the significance of these events makes it amusing and endearing.
3094;Its an amazing scene and you feel the humanity of Forrest Gump.
3095;he is an amazing actor.
3096;We see him as a person, who has something to overcome.
3097;He is lovable but a real character.
3098;"Many ""retarded"" people are depicted in movies as simple, who laugh at simple things and have no depth."
3099;But Forrest is a real character with depth that Tom Hanks masters.
3100;i love this movie it get heart and soul .
3101;Nice arrangement and screen wright~I pretty much enjoy this movie.
3102;I would say it's one of the greatest movies produced ever!
3103;An odd movie about a simple man who grows up being genuinely nice to everyone no matter who they may be or what they may have done.
3104;Tom Hanks is spectacular in his portrayal of Forrest.
3105;"The movie sends a clear message to the viewers, ""No matter what happens, take it in stride."
3106;"If you're a fan of smart films like ""The Green Mile"" and ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"", then you will definitely love ""Forrest Gump"""
3107;I've always loved this movie, from the first time I saw it.
3108;But Tom was great in it, as well as Gary Sinise.
3109;I think Gary's part in this movie, is one of his best performances, and that's sayin a lot.
3110;i love how Forrest never just gives up, like a lot of us would love to do in hard times.
3111;He always keeps going, the best he can, and always does his best to find the best in people.
3112;He's such a sweet guy who had a pretty hard life.
3113;a really great movie :)!
3114;No need to mention the humorous plots and lines, the beautiful pictures, the excellent acting, and the span of various historical backgrounds in this movie, which make it indeed the top in the film.
3115;What I like the most about the movie is its philosophical taste of life.
3116;He goes to where life takes him.
3117;time love, on the other hand, forming a great contrast with him, always pursues her dreams, tries hard, and experiences all sorts of frustration, without a happy ending.
3118;It really makes you think how one should live his life.
3119;That carries infinite taste of life.
3120;The more you watch the movie, the more you will feel the taste, and the more you will like the movie.
3121;Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor.
3122;There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with Gump .
3123;Not only did it rocket Tom Hanks to super stardom, but it is one of the greatest representations of life ever put on the big screen.
3124;As a result, he has a knack for showing up at the right place at the right time.
3125;secondly, this movie is a reflection of its times.
3126;In this case, Jenny has a Forrest to come back to, which provides the primary drama of the film.
3127;overall, Forrest Gump is a landmark effort in cinema, as it is one of the only movies that can still hold up perfectly despite being only about the journey , so to speak.
3128;It can be watched by viewers of pretty much all ages and enjoyed on some level.
3129;exposed, but it still remains a special piece of filmmaking.
3130;It's seeing history and telling it from a point of view.
3131;With history is the whole 'true love' plot, which goes well for the movie.
3132;This movie is definitely one of my favorites, my friends and I can remember it word for word and we use many quotes till this day.
3133;I highly recommend this movie because of all the great actors, the plot, etc.
3134;This is one of the best films I have ever enjoyed.
3135;Simple, profound and beautifully acted, directed and produced.
3136;FORREST GUMP (One of my favorite movies) is an uplifting, heartwarming, and heartbreaking, experience, where you see the whole wide world through the eyes of a man who's never seen it before, and hardly understands it.
3137;through my opinion, FORREST GUMP deserved every Oscar it won(Except for one).
3138;While watching this epic for the first time I laughed and cried, nearly at the same time.
3139;inspiring, and though it is PG.13, I wouldn't reccomend this to a kid 10 or under.
3140;This is a classic movie and it is Tom Hanks.
3141;ray high def has definitely enhanced the movie watching experience.
