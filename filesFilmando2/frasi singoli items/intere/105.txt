I:18729;1;Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn are fabulous in this movie.
I:18729;2;One of my absolute favorites.
I:18729;3;This product was shipped properly, arrived promptly, and has been enjoyed many times.
I:18729;4;I am extremely happy with this product.
I:18729;5;Watch the movie first and then watch it again with the directors commentary and all will be explained.
I:18729;6;the sheer sharpness of the colour and sets are still relevant today as they were 40 years ago.
I:18729;7;kISS ME KATE category of great musicals.
I:18729;8;"this film had fine production values
I:18729;9;along with THE SOUND OF MUSIC,it signaled the end of an era of decent musicals.
I:18729;10;this film is actually like a big balloon that never seems to get to the ground.
I:18729;11;"still, there are delightful moments that keeps it from sinking and makes it worth seeing
I:18729;12;aUDREY we miss you and nobody really took the place you filled so well between 1952 and 1967.
I:18729;13;"My Fair Lady, an award winning movie, for its great musical performances, and its ""impressive"" acting."
I:18729;14;This musical, an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, is said to be one of the greatest movies of its time.
I:18729;15;"You see, Pygmalion is a play based on Shaw's cynical satire, by making fun of the social class difference, and using comical ideas such as the ""undeserving poor,"" he creates a masterpiece that is worth passing on from generation to generation."
I:18729;16;one of the ways that Shaw's satire is destroyed is the fact that My Fair Lady is a musical.
I:18729;17;hollywood is known for inventing stories, just as they did in My Fair Lady.
I:18729;18;we can see that My Fair Lady is an inadequate adaptation of G. b. Shaw's masterpiece, Pygmalion.
I:18729;19;A collector's must, beautifully acted and replete with beautiful images throughout.
I:18729;20;Although historically exagerated, it is a delight to watch over and over again.
I:18729;21;I have a fairly good collection of Blue Rays and this is now one of my best!
I:18729;22;I also love the plot and the music.
I:18729;23;I thought My Fair Lady was a full screen reproduction and I thought that was what I had ordered.
I:18729;24;The movie explores human relations and just what makes high society who they are.
I:18729;25;hard to follow for my younger kids, but still a fun movie to watch and sing along with.
I:18729;26;plus shipped it with care like i was family.
I:18729;27;"Everybody has favorite movies
I:18729;28;ray, waiting for a true BD version release.
I:18729;29;This is one of my favorite films.
I:18729;30;If you like the Bernard Shaw story itself, I recommend the 1938 'Pygmalion', starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller (I believe she was Shaw's choice to play Eliza).
I:18729;31;It's Black and White naturally, but it features two of Britain's finest actors.
I:18729;32;One of the best of the 1960's musicals transferred to the screen with slavish perfection.
I:18729;33;Hepburn is superb as Eliza.
I:18729;34;See it in Blu Ray for a the prefect movie.
I:18729;35;I consider this the best movie ever made, better than Star Wars, which was the first move I saw in the theaters when I was 6 1/2.
I:18729;36;The plot is simple yet intriguing, the casting and acting superb, the music incredibly memorable.
I:18729;37;the late Jack Warner spent a great deal of money to produce thismasterpiece .
I:18729;38;has the privilege ofhaving obtained these legal rights, one should have the appropriateobligation to care for such a work of art with due respect.
I:18729;39;Audrey is superb in this movie.
I:18729;40;I love musicals and I never get enough of watching this one.
I:18729;41;The music is delightful and family friendly.
I:18729;42;I would definitely recommend this movie.
I:18729;43;It was brand new in perfect self condition
I:18729;44;I have seen this for the first time and I really enjoyed it.
I:18729;45;The cast was superb and the dialog witty.
I:18729;46;It was a very interesting take on the story Pygmalion .
I:18729;47;It is a classic must see for anybody though!
I:18729;48;So happy to have this in Blu Ray, this has been my favorite musical for over 20 years.
I:18729;49;disc Special Edition)This is truly a must.
I:18729;50;Not only is the movie itself one of the best of all times.
I:18729;51;beautiful music, witty dialogues, clever social critique, excellent actors.
I:18729;52;but the special features added to this two.
I:18729;53;disc special edition help us to gain new insight into the process of making the film and, later, recovering it so that future generations may be able to enjoy it too.
I:18729;54;I found these songs very entertaining while watching the movie.
I:18729;55;When Hepburn is shown in the ambassador's ball, she illustrates a real sophisticated duchess.
I:18729;56;Unlike Hiller, in Pygmalion, Hepburn shines in the ballroom.
I:18729;57;There is also an alteration in this scene from Shaw's play.
I:18729;58;"This never happens in Pygmalion
I:18729;59;the other characters also play an important role.
I:18729;60;At the end of the movie Eliza goes back to Higgins instead of marrying Freddy, this is a huge change in the real Pygmalion.
I:18729;61;overall, My Fair Lady is an entertaining musical which can take you back in time however the audience is able to feel the essence of a classical movie.
I:18729;62;Hepburn's character in the movie truly captivates the audience.
I:18729;63;This is a classic musical that I recommend to everyone.
I:18729;64;I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Mom.
I:18729;65;She was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it.
I:18729;66;Audrey Hepburn has always been an absolute favorite of mine.
I:18729;67;This is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot.
I:18729;68;andrew Hepburn was lovely but Julie's voice was fantastic,
I:18729;69;Marni Nixon dubbed Audrey Hepburn's singing voice in this movie musical.
I:18729;70;Shaw won a Best Screenplay Oscar for his1938 film adaptation, which included a newly written scene and character, phoenetics expert Zoltan Karpathy, who, after speaking with the well.
I:18729;71;winning production that had 2717 performances between 3/15/56 and 9/29/62.
I:18729;72;"after reassuring the girl that he's not a cop, Higgins remarks to Pickering that if he wished to do so, within a few months he could teach this ""guttersnipe"" impeccable diction and pass her off as a lady at the highest level of society."
I:18729;73;He also tells Eliza that she'd be able to open her own flower shop if she spoke proper English.
I:18729;74;Higgins accepts the challenge and so the experiment begins.
I:18729;75;There was a small glitch during the play of the movie but otherwise I was very satisfied with the product.
I:18729;76;This is my second favorite musical (after West Side Story).
I:18729;77;this movie had top production, great songs, and great acting (especially Rex Harrison).
I:18729;78;And Chicago has given musicals an awakening.
I:18729;79;Directors can turn to movies like this and the ones I mentioned above for inspiration, because these movies were created to give the best entertainment for a short period (while doing it with a lot of style).
I:18729;80;Moreover, they are still cherished today, so there is an audience out there for these types of films.
I:18729;81;"Watch ""My Fair Lady"" for the intelligence and style that was put into movies a while ago."
I:18729;82;My Fair Lady is wonderful.
I:18729;83;My Fair Lady is wonderful.
I:18729;84;A real gem of a film.
I:18729;85;I spoke to an elderly British expat and he told me that it was quite an accurate portrayal of life in British Edwardian society.
I:18729;86;In addition, much of the film's cast either lived during or shortly after the film's historical setting.
I:18729;87;The movie was just so wonderful that I watched it many times.
I:18729;88;I love every Audrey Hepburn movie I watch.
I:18729;89;This is probably one of my favorites.
I:18729;90;The music is fun, the costumes are fun, the story is fun, the accents are funny.
I:18729;91;This rags to riches / love story makes me smile every time.
I:18729;92;(. . .)Watch the movie twice, three times.
I:18729;93;subtle comments about class systems, gender roles, and the realities of the haves and have.
I:18729;94;"based on George Bernand Shaw's famous play, ""Pygmalion"", which, in turn, is based on a famous myth about the love between Pygmalion and Galatea, is thoroughly literary."
I:18729;95;audrey Hepburn is incredible, showing us that classic beauty is more than a smile.
I:18729;96;"Effervescent and light, she tells us ""The rain in Spain."""
I:18729;97;selling street girl, she shines with glamour and dignity.
I:18729;98;harrison, likewise, is grand as linguist of world.
I:18729;99;He delivers his lines with delectable articulancy, taking on hard monologues as if they were children's verses.
I:18729;100;You'll soak in the full breadth of love's complexities.
I:18729;101;"I fully recommend ""My Fair Lady."
I:18729;102;This movie will always have a wonderful place in my heart.
I:18729;103;I loved the movie then, I love it now.
I:18729;104;Enjoy the movie for what it is, a wonderful collaboration of talent!
I:18729;105;I have always loved this one.
I:18729;106;And my granddaughter loved it too.
I:18729;107;This is one of my all time favorite movie, I wanted to share with my granddaughters.
I:18729;108;But the music is wonderful (I've memorized the entire score), the costumes and the sets, and Audrey Hepburn is enchanting.
I:18729;109;Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison are super together!
I:18729;110;A classic, despite the lack of original vocals and Julie Andrews.
I:18729;111;I have loved this movie since I was a little girl.
I:18729;112;It's fun to watch it over again.
I:18729;113;As a lover of this genre, this is one of my very favorites!
I:18729;114;Excellent cast and wonderful music make this superb movie one of the best of all time.
I:18729;115;The Oh so true play based on the English social class distinction, as it used to be, and scenes and characters in Covent Garden just add richness to the whole story.
I:18729;116;What a marvelous old movie.
I:18729;117;We love anything with Audrey Hepburn.
I:18729;118;Liked it so well, we even found the stage play.
I:18729;119;"Some say ""Guys and Dolls,"" or ""Gypsy,"" or ""Sound of Music"" are the best musicals of all time, but my favorite is ""My Fair Lady."""
I:18729;120;"The story, borrowed from the Shaw play, ""Pygmalian,"" is so well adapted to the talents of Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, two of the greatest actors of all time, that this may be the perfect musical."
I:18729;121;"Classic songs like, ""On the Street Where You Live,"" and ""The Rain In Spain,"" and ""I''m Gettin' Married in the Morning,"" are simply delightful and beautiful, and are presented on screen wonderfully."
I:18729;122;It's the best collection of songs in one musical.
I:18729;123;I recommend it for non.
I:18729;124;it may get you in the mood.
I:18729;125;My Fair Lady is a musical that will live forever without a doubt and the movie version, despite the scandal that it caused in 1964 because Jack Warner cast Audrey Hepburn in the role of Eliza Doolittle instead of Julie Andrews, is still one of the finest musicals ever made.
I:18729;126;The musical took the best of Broadway, brought it to the screen with an amazing success .
I:18729;127;loewe score is classic and won the hearts of the world easily when the show premi red years ago.
I:18729;128;Even today, the music serenades listeners with the same charm.
I:18729;129;Before long, her father shows up (Stanley Holloway), and in comes the culture clash of the Cockneys and the middle class, a classic British study in social conflict.
I:18729;130;"so much for his ""original morals""!"
I:18729;131;"Everyone celebrates in the paean to ""The Rain in Spain."""
I:18729;132;Delirious with joy, they plan an event at Ascot to try out her wings.
I:18729;133;the success is complete .
I:18729;134;Higgins has won his bet.
I:18729;135;Because as you will notice when viewing it, there are many parts of the musical that need an audience's reaction to be complete.
I:18729;136;A perfect example is the scene at the race at Ascot.
I:18729;137;"When Eliza shouts at the race, without the entire audience's reaction, the scene comes across as tepid compared to when there is a full audience
I:18729;138;So much of the script seems to include audience reaction that My Fair Lady seems to be best viewed with a large group of people admiring it together.
I:18729;139;This decision came as a surprise to her, and not entirely a pleasant one.
I:18729;140;"An astute listener can tell when she is singing and when Marni Nixon is singing
I:18729;141;will he succeed?What does her father (Stanley Holloway) thing finding that she moved in whit the two professors and did not want any clothes?This is a musical version of the movie Pygmalion (1938), based on a play by George Bernard Shaw.
I:18729;142;The songs are great, but no words can do justice to this movie's grace.
I:18729;143;The covent garden scene is one of the best in the movie.
I:18729;144;If you like movies such as Oliver, Breakfast at Tiffany's or any of the Rodgers and Hammerstein's, then you will love this movie.
I:18729;145;She loves music, dancing, Audrey Hepburn, and dress.
I:18729;146;I remembered this film vaguely, from my childhood, and once we watched it, it was so perfect .
I:18729;147;The best part is that we use the songs in our everyday life, and my poor husband does everything to keep his sanity.
I:18729;148;She opened the box while on the phone and told him what was in the package, and then he proceeded to tell her a little bit about the film and the actors.
I:18729;149;This movie is as good and enjoyable now as it was when released approximately fifty years ago, the musical hits, costumes and scenery, and acting talent will never be topped by another show.
I:18729;150;The music is amazing, the acting superb, the dance scenes delightful .
I:18729;151;The girls loved it and came away singing and smiling.
I:18729;152;It is truly a gem in the crown or musical theater.
I:18729;153;ray version of this iconic movie .
I:18729;154;I highly recommend this movie to all.
I:18729;155;A little comedy, a lot of great acting, a good script and you get a movie such as My Fair Lady.
I:18729;156;The story line is great.
I:18729;157;The cast is very fun to watch.
I:18729;158;It's fun to watch the duo work together.
I:18729;159;I remember seeing this Movie with my Mother for the first time and it always brings back fond memories.
I:18729;160;Timely mailed and timely received.
I:18729;161;Timeless classic musical with Rex Harrison using language as a weapon throughout.
I:18729;162;One of the most interesting things about this and other old movies is that characters actually engage in dialogue that teaches you ways to express yourself without swearing.
I:18729;163;It's light fare, entertaining and funny.
I:18729;164;And so many wonderful songs originated with this play by Lerner and Lowe.
I:18729;165;I have always loved musicals, growing up watching them all the time, but by far My Fair Lady was the best I have ever watched.
I:18729;166;Though I was dissappointed that Audrey's voice wasn't used in the songs, there are the original songs with Audrey's voice in the extra features.
I:18729;167;If you love musicals, this is a must.
I:18729;168;Hundreds of people said so many good words already.
I:18729;169;I was a teenager and I was in love with movies and Audrey Hepburn.
I:18729;170;What a great actress she was!
I:18729;171;The whole cast is wonderful, the sets and costumes are superb, the story(of course!)
I:18729;172;is brilliant, and the music is the best.
I:18729;173;And Marni Nixon sang Eliza's songs beautifully!
I:18729;174;One of the great musical films of all time.
I:18729;175;"My Fair Lady is the 1964 Oscar winner for Best Picture and is one of the very best musicals ever made
I:18729;176;Will order again from these nice people.
I:18729;177;A wonderful addition to my collection of musicals.
I:18729;178;A delight to see the details and color of this film.
I:18729;179;Twentieth Century Fox did a fantastic job with their Blu.
I:18729;180;"set with their other Hepburn titles (""Roman Holiday"", ""Funny Face"" and ""Sabrina"" among them)."
I:18729;181;"mY FAIR LADY is a true cinema classic
I:18729;182;Seldom again would audiences be treated to such a sumptuous spectacle on the screen.
I:18729;183;despite a huge critical backlash (concerning Julie Andrews not cementing her most acclaimed stage role on film), Audrey Hepburn gives a spirited performance as feisty Eliza.
I:18729;184;Rex Harrison, having starred in both the Broadway and London productions of the show, was confident enough in his performance to sing his songs live (via a hidden microphone).
I:18729;185;also triumphantly reprises his role for the screen.
I:18729;186;Still, MY FAIR LADY is one of those movies which deserves to always be in circulation, constantly enjoyed and discovered by new audiences.
I:18729;187;This film is a classic.
I:18729;188;Possibly one of the greatest films you will ever see.
I:18729;189;The characters are beautiful and Audrey Hepburn simply shines as Eliza Doolittle.
I:18729;190;Rex Harrison plays an excellent portrayal of the gruff yet loveable Henry Higgins.
I:18729;191;The music gets in your head and you'll be singing it for hours after.
I:18729;192;One of the greatest if not the greatest musical of all time.
I:18729;193;Lerner's words were poetic and lyrical and in Henry Higgins case, very satirical.
I:18729;194;Mr. Harrison and Miss Hepburn bring livliness and fun to their characters and Stanley Holloway's turn as Eliza's father purely brilliant.
I:18729;195;I also liked Gladys Cooper as Henry's mother.
I:18729;196;If I have one favorite part it has to be the Ascot races where Eliza's exurberance gets the best of her but at the end she is more than a match for Professor Higgins and watching her transformation is great fun.
I:18729;197;All in all, a great film.
I:18729;198;Whenever I want to return to a time when Hollywood honored wit and charm, I put on My Fair Lady.
I:18729;199;Using digital technology to the best of their abilities, a new archival element was created .
I:18729;200;preserving the film and allowing a new generation of viewers to see it in a condition not seen since the 1960s.
I:18729;201;Approximately 20% of the screen is affected.
I:18729;202;It is as if you were viewing the film with tunnel vision .
I:18729;203;The edges of the picture is hazy and milky .
I:18729;204;a solid light blue with the title printed at the top.
I:18729;205;My mother treasures in her memory going to the cinema with her own father to see Audrey Hepburn's films, when she was young.
I:18729;206;She was also an admirer of Ms Hepburn's acting skills and style.
I:18729;207;Absolutely worth having if you love classic Hollywood films.
I:18729;208;singing Hepburn was perfect in the role of Eliza Doolittle, the Cockney flower girl transformed into a lady by Henry Higgins (an Oscar winning Rex Harrison).
I:18729;209;Hepburn was the best choice.
I:18729;210;higgins and Colonel Pickering have a bet over Henry's ability to transform Eliza from a Cockney flower girl to an English lady is the base of the musical.
I:18729;211;Henry will accomplish this by changing the way she speaks.
I:18729;212;Both Henry and Freddie Hill fall in love with Eliza as her language improves.
I:18729;213;Both want to marry her.
I:18729;214;however, an irony to this musical is that it is wholly based on stinging Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw's PYGMALION.
I:18729;215;He viewed the English with their class distinctions, with the upper classes having ultra posh voices, with scorn and disdain.
I:18729;216;His was a class study and a scathing one at that.
I:18729;217;They set it to musical numbers and changed the ending so that yes, this was a happy ever romance between Henry and Eliza.
I:18729;218;Voila, one of the best loved musicals of the twentieth century emerged.
I:18729;219;For example, a great deal of action in this movie is conveyed via the actor's facial expressions.
I:18729;220;I've seen a number of her films on the big screen at the Stanford Theatre (a wonderfully restored theatre in Palo Alto that screens the classics).
I:18729;221;She nearly recovers with her Ascot performance, which is absolutely stunning and hilarious.
I:18729;222;This is Audrey at her best.
I:18729;223;The book and movie vary in certain aspects, like the fact that the movie is a musical and also some of the words are changed, added, and sometimes even left out.
I:18729;224;For example, Higgins, in the book, has a very strong and controlling personality, as well as Eliza.
I:18729;225;In the movie they exaggerate the upper class and its elegance, like in the party where everyone is dressed in black and white and everything was done with extreme care and elegance.
I:18729;226;I love Julie Andrews work, but Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice for the role.
I:18729;227;The musical score was terrific and the costumes were just out of this world.
I:18729;228;The music, the costumes, the sets!!
I:18729;229;Great film for all ages.
I:18729;230;"I'm old enough that I saw a ""road"" production of this fabulous musical and I remain a fan."
I:18729;231;ray edition is magnificent on a 55 inch Samsung.
I:18729;232;The special features are informative and appreciated.
I:18729;233;It is a very classic story set to wonderful music.
I:18729;234;The interactions between Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison make this a real gem worth seeing over and over.
I:18729;235;They've seen this movie a lot, so was great to watch them watch it again with such clarity.
I:18729;236;You can transform yourself into anybody or anything you want if you put your mind to it.
I:18729;237;"For the ignorants, ""My Fair lady"" is an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's splendid play ""Pygmalion""."
I:18729;238;Her job in this movie is totally credible, whatsoever I think people expect a poorer looking girl after reading Pygmalion, also she doesn't even sing in the movie, a singer does it for her, known as Marni Nixon.
I:18729;239;"Whatsoever ""My Fair Lady"" is one of the best movies in the history of cinematography, along with ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Godfather"" trilogy, ""Casablanca"", ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", and so on."
I:18729;240;It is the best musical ever!
I:18729;241;The love story, the songs, the clothes.
I:18729;242;But what really made me fall in love with it that it is a love story.
I:18729;243;he was so nice to Eliza, and he wasn't afraid to tell her how he felt about her, unlike Henry.
I:18729;244;But that point aside, this movie is such a fun story, and you really want to see how it turns out.
I:18729;245;A true classic among classics, My Fair Lady is a must.
I:18729;246;see for anyone who has ever dreamed of being swept off their feet.
I:18729;247;i love audrey hepburn and this one is in my top 5 favorite of her movies!!
I:18729;248;nice to have it on blu.
I:18729;249;I love this movie and have wanted my own copy for soo long!
I:18729;250;This was a great price and I received it fast!
I:18729;251;I definitely recommend this seller!
I:18729;252;This was a surprise present for my niece who really wanted to watch the film while recouperating from a broken ankle.
I:18729;253;So as a 'get well' gift, it was wonderful.
I:18729;254;Price was right, shipping speed fantastic.
I:18729;255;The movie is a good one and the service was also.
I:18729;256;My Fair Lady is one of the best musicals every.
I:18729;257;Its humorist, and great songs like `Wouldn't it be Lovely?'
I:18729;258;Audrey Hepburn is witty as Eliza Doolittle and Rex Harrison is wonderful as Professor Henry Higgins.
I:18729;259;It is winner to eight academy awards including best picture.
I:18729;260;Rex Harrison's role is superb and who could not but love Audrey Hepburn.
I:18729;261;Even the musical haters will love this one!
I:18729;262;Such a great film, but I've given it such a low rating.
I:18729;263;This spoils the whole film.
I:18729;264;This is a wonderful movie!
I:18729;265;disc Special Edition is worth the extra money.
I:18729;266;If you like classic musicals, then this will be a nice addition to your collection.
I:18729;267;This is one of our favorite musicals.
I:18729;268;We are happy to have it in our library.
I:18729;269;So glad I was able to get this in time for my mom to visit :) we both enjoyed it immensely.
I:18729;270;Singing in the Rain is the greatest movie musical.
I:18729;271;but the greatest Broadway shows made into movies are these:Guys and Dolls, My Fair Lady, Sweeney Todd, Hairspray and there are perhaps 5 others we could quibble about whether they should be on the list.
I:18729;272;nearly every song is a gem, and as Stanley Kaufman wrote when the movie first came out (at a budget of eight million dollars which was considered outrageous at the time): (to paraphrase) It is worth every penny because it preserves Rex Harrison's magnificent performance.
I:18729;273;Watching this film on Blue Ray is amazing.
I:18729;274;This classic is even better now.
I:18729;275;When my daughter was very young I used to watch My Fair Lady and she was so excited to watch it.
I:18729;276;This movie is a classic and doesn't age!
I:18729;277;Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison are a great duo for this movie.
I:18729;278;Audrey is of course beautiful, even when she's covered in dust!
I:18729;279;If you like old films, this is one of the greatest.
I:18729;280;You can't beat Audrey Hepburn for beautiful starlets, and an incredible performance.
I:18729;281;Delivery was fast and condition excellent.
I:18729;282;One of my favorite classics of all time.
I:18729;283;You'll need to own it because you will want to watch it again and again and again!
I:18729;284;"Audrey Hepburn is absolutely fantastic as Eliza Doolittle, and Rex Harrison shines as Professor Higgins, an expert linguist who transforms Eliza from an ordinary ""flower girl"" into a stunningly beautiful ""Duchess."""
I:18729;285;"Damon Medic says, ""My Fair Lady"" is a ""must see"" for everyone ages 12.100."
I:18729;286;Audrey Hepburn is magnificent as Eliza Doolittle.
I:18729;287;Professor Henry Higgins transforms the common flower girl into a Duchess as part of a bet with Colonel Pickering from India.
I:18729;288;Eliza has fallen in love with her teacher, Higgins, who is a confirmed bachelor, and is only interested in winning his bet with Pickering.
I:18729;289;"Eliza becomes a true ""lady"", but wonders what is to become of her."
I:18729;290;Eventually, Eliza becomes independent and strong at the precise moment that Higgins becomes needy.
I:18729;291;This is a extremely elegant and stylish movie .
I:18729;292;Extremely witty and classic songs, a swish script, and gorgeous costumes.
I:18729;293;George Cukor directs it with true aplomb, turning Titanic.
I:18729;294;era London into a stylised and colourful mel e, bringing out the humour and joyfulness of the screenplay, and Cecil Beaton's extravagant and yet, somehow, chic costumes and sets form a perfect setting for the actors .
I:18729;295;and the actors themselves are superb.
I:18729;296;The appeal for this film lies in its spectacle .
I:18729;297;I saw it at the cinema once, in an arthouse revival, and it was utterly amazing .
I:18729;298;a cinematic glory of a particular type that would be impossible to duplicate ever again.
I:18729;299;The Ascot scene is worth the money alone, a refreshing, gliding harmony of black and white, choreographed and stylised escapism, totally summing up the essence of a musical.
I:18729;300;Much of the story's already known.
I:18729;301;But when she finally does, it's a triumph, which leads to the back to back ebullience of The Rain in Spain and I Could Have Danced All Night, with Hepburn's singing voice done by Marni Nixon.
I:18729;302;Men had more independence than women then, and Higgins is able to do what he wants.
I:18729;303;And speaking of marriage, it's clearly a bourgeois concept.
I:18729;304;audrey Hepburn's talents really come forth via her brash and loud Cockney accent, and for this she worked with phonetics professor Peter Ladefoged at USC in LA.
I:18729;305;"She is effervescent throughout, whatever costume she wears
I:18729;306;Working with Hepburn, his performance was more challenging and spirited, and hence his Best Actor Oscar.
I:18729;307;indeed, it won eight Oscars, including three of the big four.
I:18729;308;And Cecil Beaton's costume designs was another deserved win, not only for Eliza's white Ascot dress and hat, but for the ballroom scene as well.
I:18729;309;this is one of Hepburn's best vehicles, along with Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Charade, How To Steal A Million, and Wait Until Dark.
I:18729;310;I also want to know how the extra features on Blu.
I:18729;311;I have it on VHS, but this is even better.
I:18729;312;They really did a great job in restoring the video and audio on this movie.
I:18729;313;"My Fair Lady is an elaborate wedding cake
I:18729;314;and then, after he's proved he can wow you with white alone, Academy Award winning director George Cukor pops your eyes: a magenta gown and exotic, feathered headdress bedeck a woman descending a stair.
I:18729;315;with the funniest parody of British stiff upper lips.
I:18729;316;And the Transylvanian Queen is played by a real Baroness, Bina Rothschild.
I:18729;317;"the songs exemplify the best of Broadway: ""Wouldn't it be Loverly?"""
I:18729;318;She is beautiful and she's got soul and intelligence to burn.
I:18729;319;The attention she brings to one small scene .
I:18729;320;He really owned these roles.)
I:18729;321;Harrison is entirely believable, even though his performance is stagey, larger than life, and his dialogue frequently over.
I:18729;322;"My Fair Lady was based on George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmalion,"" which took its title from a sublime Greek myth."
I:18729;323;Perhaps thanks to unconscious motivation, he carves a woman: Galatea.
I:18729;324;Over time, the proud bachelor metamorphosizes into a humble supplicant.
I:18729;325;Just as his hard arrogance melts, and he resurrects to a new life of love, Galatea's marble melts, and she lives to love her Pygmalion.
I:18729;326;"one definition of ""main character"": it's the character who changes."
I:18729;327;It's *his* journey that has made this tale poignant to two plus millennia of fans.
I:18729;328;"it is a convention of Romantic movies that the lead couple ""meet cute."""
I:18729;329;He is endlessly affectionate to, appreciative of, and polite with Colonel Pickering.
I:18729;330;"She struggles
I:18729;331;By the end of the movie, when Eliza is in Higgins' presence, she keeps silent till spoken to, and looks at the floor.
I:18729;332;imagine how fine this film could have been had we had a scene where we see Higgins undergo the change that rocked Pygmalion's world, and some of our own, as well, when we finally found love.
I:18729;333;But 'Lady' moves precisely because it is an Audrey Hepburn picture, one of those duckling.
I:18729;334;The fact that Audrey's own beautiful English was inflected by her Dutch background gives her a 'foreigness' that further adds to her alienation.
I:18729;335;possessed chic, qualities that see Shaw's brittle comedy crack into tragedy .
I:18729;336;Viewed as a George Cukor film, however, and 'Lady' is a triumph.
I:18729;337;"Holmes is like Sherlock Holmes, an eecentric bachelor genius with slightly dimmer sidekick and loyal housekeeper, who can 'read' the unmanagable city and its inhabitants by (verbal) clues
I:18729;338;Perhaps the real subject of the film, cued in the budding flowers of the opening titles, is Eliza's sexuality, potentially deviant and disruptive, and often suspect to accusations of vice, which must be controlled for more 'respectable' barter.
I:18729;339;She is a kind of wild child, an animalistic savage who must be 'tamed' by benevolent Imperialists like the gentleman scholar and the Raj officer.
I:18729;340;alan Jay Lerner's unfailingly witty book is a vast improvement on the original, and the songs are such a delight that straight filming of the musical would be pleasure enough.
I:18729;341;Each character and mood has its own type of music .
I:18729;342;"Contrary to what it may sound like, ""My Fair Lady"" is not one of those girly romantic musicals (not that there is anything wrong with that), but is very very funny with some hilarious acting and singing and an overall good plot."
I:18729;343;I got the two disc special edition and would highly recommend it.
I:18729;344;I watched the documentary on how the film was restored as well as on the history of the movie, and would say it adds alot to the overall experience.
I:18729;345;this movie is worth 5 stars all the way
I:18729;346;Yes, the songs were good.
I:18729;347;The story plot was certainly a good one.
I:18729;348;Higgins has a talk with her, and decides he can live without her.
I:18729;349;delivers a line she'd said at their first movie.
I:18729;350;In my English, they taught me that a good story has all the elements.
I:18729;351;It is well done, and a great family picture
I:18729;352;It is a beloved Oscar winning classic that is, of course, 5 stars.
I:18729;353;She sings a very enthusiatic, sprightly version that would have worked well and, in my opinion, Nixon's help was not necessary there.
I:18729;354;Nixon did not receive credit at the time so when it leaked out that her overdub was used, Hepburn's brilliant acting performance didn't even garner a best actress Oscar nomination.
I:18729;355;She was nominated for and recieved best actress.
I:18729;356;another interesting bit about casting is that Cary Grant was offered the part of Professor Henry Higgins.
I:18729;357;there is so much of interest in the special features, both on the first and second discs, that I highly recommend the two disc version.
I:18729;358;My review of the dubbing controversy is only a small part of the fascinating information which is included.
I:18729;359;i am a true devotee of this movie .
I:18729;360;and this BD is without doubt the best version ever of this classic and beautifully produced film.
I:18729;361;is the forthcoming 8K transfer of the supreme masterpiece of all time.
I:18729;362;Audrey Hepburn is magnificent in her role.
I:18729;363;Definitely everyone on this planet adores 'My Fair Lady' .
I:18729;364;If you care about the soundtrack, the US edition has the right pitch.
I:18729;365;Love this movie, so pleased to be able to introduce it to my 3 year old (and she loves it too).
I:18729;366;ray really makes it pop.
I:18729;367;I love Audrey Hepburn, this is her best yet, the costumes were superb and who did not love Rex Harrison' irrascible character in this movie.
I:18729;368;He was a rock and really carries his own as do most of the characters in this musical.
I:18729;369;It is the best, right up there with Evita!
I:18729;370;My Fair Lady is a great Classic!
I:18729;371;a bit longer than I remembered, but every bit as entertaining.
I:18729;372;The music I've heard all my life and can now sing along with.
I:18729;373;A must see movie to help one appreciate the person you are inside, not just for the stuff you have.
I:18729;374;known, definitely one of her most exquisite.
I:18729;375;The enmity towards her teacher grows, especially amid one revenge fantasy.
I:18729;376;But Pickering is sympathetic to her.
I:18729;377;at one point, Mr. Doolittle pays a visit to the Professor that will alter the course of his life as well.
I:18729;378;Pickering is straightforward about this , while Higgins hides behind his pride.
I:18729;379;So what will the resolution be?Viewers will find it amid a Lerner and Lowe score, performances, and costumes that are as exquisite as any flowers Eliza Doolittle might have sold.
I:18729;380;"A toast to all involved in this ""loverly"" production!"
I:18729;381;One of my childhood favorites!!!
I:18729;382;Great, romantic story, great music, great senery, great humor, great acting .
I:18729;383;just a great, clean movie for all ages!
I:18729;384;Now she's dancing and singing all the famous tunes.
I:18729;385;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:18729;386;I teach my grands the songs and listen to them singing the words in the English way .
I:18729;387;I thought the music was wonderful.
I:18729;388;I thought Audrey Hepburn was just adorable and so full of energy and grace and just fascinating to watch.
I:18729;389;Rex Harrison was an absolutely perfect Professor Higgins and never wavered or changed character.
I:18729;390;the story is brilliant of course, taken from George Bernard Shaw's acclaimed play Pygmalion, although materially altered to fit the requirements of a musical comedy.
I:18729;391;possessed confirmed bachelor, a kind of nineteenth century British man of science, wonderfully accomplished in his profession, but blind to himself when it comes to relationships with other people, made for a most interesting match.
I:18729;392;And the delusive dream of a man forming his own perfect woman (which is the basis of the Pygmalion legend) works so very well with a conceited linguist tutoring a cockney girl.
I:18729;393;The entire concept is a work of genius with the drunken father and the objectifying Col. Pickering and the very right Mrs. Pierce.
I:18729;394;There is no doubt that Marni Nixon, who did the singing, has a beautiful and commanding voice, and we are the better for having heard her, but why is the dubbing so obvious?
I:18729;395;Beyond this is the question of why Julie Andrews, who has a voice to match that of Miss Nixon, and charisma and charm at least in the same ballpark as Miss Hepburn, wasn't asked to play the part that she knew so very well from her experience on the stage.
I:18729;396;But all is forgiven because Audrey Hepburn is just so beautiful, so elegant and so delightful in the part.
I:18729;397;I especially loved her in the opening scene in her soiled clothes and hat and her sour voice.
I:18729;398;By the way, I have heard Julie Andrews sing the part, although I never saw her on the stage, and the way she meow's Eliza's accent, like a cat's claw on a chalk board, is really amazing.
I:18729;399;This is one of the best movie musicals ever made, a sheer delight highlighted not only by Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, but by Stanley Holloway as the Liza's lovable rascal father and Wilfrid Hyde.
I:18729;400;white as the very understanding and very properly British Col. Pickering with opulent direction by the great George Cukor.
I:18729;401;The sets and production numbers are gorgeous.
I:18729;402;But see it for Audrey Hepburn, one of the great stars of the silver screen in one of her most memorable roles.
I:18729;403;This is a great adaptation of the Broadway show and adaptation of Pygmalion.
I:18729;404;This is a must for those who love musicals with a story.
I:18729;405;Always loved this actress, and especially this one.
I:18729;406;Will pass along to the entire family for them to enjoy.
I:18729;407;Great transfer, as good as you ever saw it on the big screen.
I:18729;408;And yes, she's wonderful . . .
I:18729;409;My Fair Lady is one of the greatest musicals of all time.
I:18729;410;"Lerner and Loewe's score never violated the wit, elegance, and sophistication of George Bernard Shaw's ""Pygmalion."""
I:18729;411;"The songs enhance the story
I:18729;412;"The 1964 film version won eight Oscars
I:18729;413;Cecil Beaton certainly deserved the Oscar for his sumptuous costume design.
I:18729;414;"But ""Fair Lady"" is about more than clothes and glamour."
I:18729;415;It is a brillant satire of the British social class system.
I:18729;416;All the great scenes and songs are intact in the film version.
I:18729;417;My Fair Lady has been preserved here as a museum piece.
I:18729;418;I keep waiting for a spark of excitement and pace that seldom materializes.
I:18729;419;The film is obviously shot entirely in a studio.
I:18729;420;"Cukor won the ""Best Director"" Oscar for ""Fair Lady,"" but this is far from his best work."
I:18729;421;"That would be his masterpiece ""A Star Is Born"" with Judy Garland in 1954
I:18729;422;rex Harrison also earned an Oscar for recreating his Tony.
I:18729;423;create her Broadway and London stage triumph as Eliza Doolittle, leaving Audrey Hepburn to deal with the inevitable critical slings and arrows.
I:18729;424;Indeed, the film comes alive whenever Audrey is on screen.
I:18729;425;"Julie Andrews achieved great cinematic success, in short order, with ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound Of Music."""
I:18729;426;"And Audrey and Julie, both very ""fair ladies,"" became good friends just a few years later."
I:18729;427;"sad to admit, but I feel that, as cinema, the story is better served in the outstanding 1938 film version of ""Pygmalion,"" starring the superb Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard."
I:18729;428;The gorgeous background flowers are grainy and in questionable focus, and there is indeed fog around the edge of the picture in the opening outdoor scenes.
I:18729;429;Those moments are dazzling, and it makes you realize what the film might have looked like.
I:18729;430;This is a wonderful musical, family film!
I:18729;431;I loved being able to watch it with my 14 year old daughter.
I:18729;432;She now enjoys it as much as the rest of the family.
I:18729;433;Audrey Hepburn is brilliant in the role!
I:18729;434;The singing for the role, (not by Hepburn, but dubed in) is superb.
I:18729;435;The acting is good, the sets are good the costumes are good, the music is wonderful, the lyrics are wonderful.
I:18729;436;there are exeptions: Rex Harrison is wonderful!
I:18729;437;This is such a wonderful film .
I:18729;438;disc edition and have enjoyed it thoroughly.
I:18729;439;Very much enjoyed this remastered film.
I:18729;440;the movie itself is, of course, a classic, and deservedly so.
I:18729;441;"the ""special"" extras are so."
I:18729;442;If you're a film buff, you'll like them.
I:18729;443;This is a great movie.
I:18729;444;This is a timeless classic.
I:18729;445;if you have never seen this movie, I would highly recommend this one.
I:18729;446;It captures everything that a musical should be.
I:18729;447;I have always loved this movie and only had it on VHS.
I:18729;448;I was happy to receive it as a Mother's Day present this year and loved watching it.
I:18729;449;A wonderful play that became a classic movie.
I:18729;450;If you are an Audrey Fan like me you will be thrilled.
I:18729;451;Her tranformation is amazing and the timeless story is lots of fun.
I:18729;452;"For starters, the plot, adapted from ""Pygmalion,"" written by the great author, George Bernard Shaw, is wonderfully engaging and truly timeless."
I:18729;453;What's more, this musical has a beautiful score, written by the team of Lerner and Loewe.
I:18729;454;Some of the most beautiful pieces from musical theatre are showcased here.
I:18729;455;It is definitely a credit to the judgement and vision of director, George Cukor, the he chose to use Rex Harrison, who truly WAS Dr. Henry Higgins on the stage, and decided to keep in the movie, as well.
I:18729;456;The chemistry between Hepburn and Harrison is real and believeable, as the complexities of their relationship, as pupil and professor, carry into something of a more personal and (possibly) romantic nature.
I:18729;457;Five stars for the single disc version was richly deserved.
I:18729;458;disc set have actually REMOVED the CAST AND CREW section found in the one disc version.
I:18729;459;disc version to find out where Audrey Hepburn was born, won the Oscar and got nominated.
I:18729;460;i tell you what I like about the 2 Disc version:1.
I:18729;461;The audio track ran for only a few minutes, and I had a new found respect for Directors.
I:18729;462;the rest of Disc 2 is really scraping the floor of the store.
I:18729;463;"For the price of 5 commandments (about half the price of the 2 disc My Fair Lady), you will get more than double the enjoyment, making it look like ""the TWENTY COMMANDMENTS""."
I:18729;464;Released in 1964, at the end of Jack Warner's long career as a producer/ movie mogul, MY FAIR LADY still has the power to entertain and inspire.
I:18729;465;ray version has footage of Hepburn actually trying to sing) .
I:18729;466;but she manages to capture the waif.
I:18729;467;The orchestrations are lush, the choruses memorable, the score pure heaven.
I:18729;468;It's a long film, coming in at 170+ minutes, but can still appeal to viewers of all generations.
I:18729;469;I've had this saved on my dvr for some time, and was looking forward to seeing this classic, well loved musical.
I:18729;470;Rex Harrison is terrific in his defining role as Professor Higgins, and Audrey Hepburn is beautiful as the socially challenged Eliza Doolittle.
I:18729;471;now to the script: Professor Higgins makes a bet with a friend that he can transform the street beggar Eliza Doolittle into a socially graceful and desirable woman within six months.
I:18729;472;He takes her into his home and teaches her the proper way to speak the English language and to dress.
I:18729;473;some of the songs are memorable and tremendous, with catchy choruses such as Wouldn't it Be Loverly, The Rain in Spain, Get Me to the Church on Time, and (my favorite) With a Little Bit of Luck.
I:18729;474;The ending is less than satisfying to say the least, but I suppose for that time, it was realistic.
I:18729;475;After seeing this musical many times on stage, I continue to enjoy the movie version.
I:18729;476;Shaw's classical legend update, Pygmalion, may have been the seed for the story, and yet for those of us who love romance,My Fair Lady offers us the dazzling possibility of happiness.
I:18729;477;It is a favorite with my entire family.
I:18729;478;Showed it to my son.
I:18729;479;another one of my favorite actress.
I:18729;480;she is so good and darling.
I:18729;481;Based on Shaw's Pygmalion, this rags to riches story is a classic because it is so well.
I:18729;482;done and the storyline ties in to the American myth.
I:18729;483;the sets, music, writing, plot all enter into the mix of making this the classic it is.
I:18729;484;This is one of those films people watched over and over because it has the potential of being a pleasant addiction.
I:18729;485;Lerner and Loewe's music is superb.
I:18729;486;My wife and girls love this movie.
I:18729;487;They have watched it many times over the years so I bought it as a present for our collection.
I:18729;488;Its O. k. Old fashioned movie!
I:18729;489;I love this movie and the play it comes from.
I:18729;490;The color is beautiful and the audio is perfect.
I:18729;491;The special features about the mastering is very interesting and includes comparisons with the original film.
I:18729;492;a great trip down memory lane.
I:18729;493;i preordered this great film and have looked forward to the restored version of this classic coming to blu.
I:18729;494;Both sides of the picture are out of focus and lack color.
I:18729;495;style story in such a stage.
I:18729;496;What is missing is true cinematic invention in telling a most enchanting story with interesting questions raised around the power of personal transformation.
I:18729;497;visually, despite Cecil Beaton's extravagant costumes and Gene Allen's detailed art direction, there is a persistent lethargy captured on screen perhaps because the camera set.
I:18729;498;Even though she seems a mite mature for the role, she looks stunning after her aural breakthrough, especially in her elaborate Ascot dress and hat.
I:18729;499;disc set is a great package for aficionados.
I:18729;500;The second disc includes an excellent making.
I:18729;501;It is beyond rating this wonder.
I:18729;502;The Lyrics, music, acting, costumes, are superb without doubt, question or comparison.
I:18729;503;If this were lets say Valley of the Dolls or Barbarella, it would be accceptable, but this is a classic of the American Cinema and after three viewings of this sub par Blu Ray, I am still in shock!
I:18729;504;My girlfriend loves this movie and receiving the special edition made her cry.
I:18729;505;As usual Amazon got it to me in perfect timing.
I:18729;506;the special features are great and give wonderful insight to the film itself.
I:18729;507;Now that I have seen it also, I love it just as much.
I:18729;508;I love the way they dressed back in the day.
I:18729;509;The story line is great also.
I:18729;510;It pays to treat people with loving kindness.
I:18729;511;Saw the original movie years ago and loved it.
I:18729;512;It's still charming and delightful.
I:18729;513;Highly recommend it for family entertainment.
I:18729;514;She wants every movie that she made, even if she is not the main character.
I:18729;515;The first time I saw it I hated it, but it's the sort that sticks in your mind and grows on you until you absolutely love it.
I:18729;516;You'll love Just you wait, Enry Iggins.
I:18729;517;:) My name is Eliza and this movie makes it so much easier for people to remember.
I:18729;518;concerning the script, dialogues were, indeed, very accurate and from that perspective, portrayed an accurate interpretation of the play.
I:18729;519;But the emphasis of a musical is very distinct than the main focus of a play.
I:18729;520;But it is evident that the interpretation of the director differs from the original version.
I:18729;521;And this comes from a girl who adores Audrey Hepburn!
I:18729;522;But the moment the score began I was hooked at this humerous, enchanting tale of an very unusual Cinderella and Fairy Godmother.
I:18729;523;The music is perfect, suited to every emotion felt by every character, making for a bright, fun, and touching musical experience.
I:18729;524;The setting is grand, even for the streets of London (though it is probably not a good thing to romanticize poverty) but in the guise of the theatre it works perfectly.
I:18729;525;The very motions of the actors are brilliantly thought.
I:18729;526;The acting is spot on, especially by the great Audrey who rids herself of charm to play the most obnoxious street urchin you will ever meet.
I:18729;527;It's a touching story full of vivid, wild characters and plenty of heart.
I:18729;528;"As for the second disk, the geek in me loved the features that added plenty of trivia to my first ""My Fair Lady"" experience."
I:18729;529;"Even though the film ""My Fair Lady"" may seem a bit slow for our modern times, to those who enjoy musicals it will be a very pleasant experience to watch Bernard Shaw's amusing characters from Pygmalion singing while presenting us a satirical point of view of the distinction of social classes in England."
I:18729;530;mannered and to speak as a duchess.
I:18729;531;This cast included Audrey Hepburn, who didn't really look like a low class flower girl in the beginning but appeared spectacular after the transition into a duchess.
I:18729;532;Her fine acting made the character come to life, brought spark to the play and provoked laughter to the audience quite a number of times.
I:18729;533;No one could have interpreted the new Eliza as charming, stylish and beautifully as Hepburn.
I:18729;534;Rex Harrison also does a fine job at playing his arrogant character, Professor Higgins.
I:18729;535;This relationship makes it a romantic musical and makes the film distinct from the original Pygmalion.
I:18729;536;This was a typical move for the producers since most audiences prefer happy endings.
I:18729;537;"to sum up, ""My Fair Lady"", is a must."
I:18729;538;see classical for musical lovers.
I:18729;539;The actors were fantastic, and had a lot of chemistry with each other, especially Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn.
I:18729;540;The film could appear somewhat slow and dull for some people since it is old, but if you appreciate musicals and humor this is the movie for you.
I:18729;541;This has been a favorite musical of mine for a long time.
I:18729;542;It holds up even after all of these years.
I:18729;543;Not having seen it for many decades, this was fantastic .
I:18729;544;If you liked the play you'll love this version.
I:18729;545;I really liked the story, so I bought the movie.
I:18729;546;Great if you like musical and/or classics.
I:18729;547;Audrey Hepburn performance in this movie is fantastic and the music is even better.
I:18729;548;I love it more each time I watch it.
I:18729;549;The clothes, the music, the people, everything is just right.
I:18729;550;I highly recommend this if you love musicals.
I:18729;551;This is my favorite of all.
I:18729;552;Rex Harrison is great, too.
I:18729;553;Rex Harrison steals the show.
I:18729;554;Sound and picture are divine.
I:18729;555;A more sophisticated take on the Cinderalla story My Fair Lady is a classic.
I:18729;556;The clothes, the music, and the language all make this movie unforgettable and very entertaining for the whole family.
I:18729;557;This has always been one of my favorite movies growing up.
I:18729;558;I had seen Pygmalion (1938) while I was in high school and knew this was a musical version of it.
I:18729;559;I liked it, though I was content with that single viewing.
I:18729;560;But when I saw my wife light up as she talked about how she wished we owned a copy, I went ahead and ordered My Fair Lady, along with Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, as part of her anniversary gift.
I:18729;561;i have to admit this was one of the funniest movies I have seen.
I:18729;562;Alfred P. Doolittle has to be my favorite character in the whole movie.
I:18729;563;I have since watched it with my kids and they have come to love it, as well.
I:18729;564;Definitely worth the money and a great family movie to boot.
I:18729;565;Putting together a good cast, plot, and songs, this film is quite good.
I:18729;566;"This is the best known version of George Bernard Shaw's play ""Pygmalion."""
I:18729;567;The Hollywood musical builds on the Broadway musical because it is not constrained by stage settings and scenery.
I:18729;568;It might have been better if they had retained Julie Andrews (who played Eliza Doolittle in the Broadway production) but it is still an all time classic musical.
I:18729;569;There are some changes from the original Pygmalion, and that might offend some purists, but the musical version came out great.
I:18729;570;This musical won 8 Oscars including Best Picture and it is richly deserving of the accolades.
I:18729;571;The cast is superb and the songs are all standards destined to be appreciated over the years.
I:18729;572;"wise it isn't perfect but it's still very good given the state of the severely deteriorated original master and is still a lot better than many other ""restored"" older films that I've seen."
I:18729;573;There is a nice short making.
I:18729;574;It is gorgeous, intelligent, and one of the most beloved and brilliant romantic comedies.
I:18729;575;It's got music that makes you want to dance all night, and it's got an actress who possessed class, style and the kind of beauty and charm that would never be reincarnated after she was gone.
I:18729;576;My Fair Lady (1964) directed by George Cukor is a great musical but is perfect no matter what genre you are looking at .
I:18729;577;it's got something for everyone .
I:18729;578;friend's eyes and I know that we both witnessed incredible moment created by the power of the human imagination.
I:18729;579;ray of My Fair Lady is so beautiful.
I:18729;580;The clarity and colors our outstanding and you can see detail better than other releases of this Classic musical.
I:18729;581;If you love musicals, then this is for you!
I:18729;582;They share a love/hate relationship.
I:18729;583;Marni Nixon does an EXCELLENT job dubbing Audrey's singing voice.
I:18729;584;hill's singing voice is soo romantic, since he sings a love song for Eliza.
I:18729;585;Overall, this is a timeless masterpiece, and I cannot imagine ANYONE not liking it.
I:18729;586;I also love 'The Rain in Spain.'
I:18729;587;Overall, this musical movie deserves more than TEN stars!
I:18729;588;The remake was more enjoyable than the original after all those years.
I:18729;589;My mother loved these kind of movies, so we all were blessed with watching them when ever they would be on.
I:18729;590;I now own this classic and it helps me to remember those moments from my childhood.
I:18729;591;This is a wonderful movie, filled with wonderful characters, wit, humor, actors and actresses, and infinitely wonderful songs.
I:18729;592;"And so goes ""My Fair Lady"", with memorable songs, ""Wouldn't it be Loverly"", ""Show Me"", Why Can't a Woman be More LIke a Man"", and many more."
I:18729;593;It's one I will be watching over and over again.
I:18729;594;I bought it not because I love the film, I'm sure it's very good, but because it's on the AFI top 100 films of all.
I:18729;595;She was such a beautiful and classy lady and a great actress.
I:18729;596;This is one of my favorite movies, and I wanted to share the experience with my two Granddaughters!
I:18729;597;Hey loved too so much they go around the house singing the songs from the movie!Thanks you!
I:18729;598;Growing up I had Original London Cast with Julie Andrews, and this will always be the 'Real Thing' for me.
I:18729;599;Years later, I can appreciate the movie for all its intensity to capture the stage version.
I:18729;600;For me, It will always have faint echoes and as well as the ambiguity of Shaw's drama and its classical origins in myth.
I:18729;601;Like good drama, good lyrics find print
I:18729;602;My Fair Lady is one of the greatest musical films ever produced.
I:18729;603;but a defect in the transfer leaves the image a bit lighter at the far left and right edges of the screen .
I:18729;604;I have always loved this movie and I am thrilled to finally own it.
I:18729;605;to order from some of those other stores , would actually have cost less, this came wrapped new, had extended features, it was all great and the friend was pleased.
I:18729;606;Harrison is excellent, so is Hepburn.
I:18729;607;That said, the movie still is a joy!
I:18729;608;This is not only a great story and a great musical.
I:18729;609;This great movie from 1964 is the winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture Of The Year.
I:18729;610;Rex Harrison won the Academy Award for Best Actor.
I:18729;611;Brand new, still in cellophane packaging!
I:18729;612;Arrived just in time, well packaged.
I:18729;613;Great service and recieved product very quickly.
I:18729;614;I'm very happy with this seller.
I:18729;615;This is such a great movie with great acting!!
I:18729;616;it holds all the behind the scene gems for any movie fan.
I:18729;617;who also dubbed for Deborah Kerr THE KING AND I, Natalie Wood WEST SIDE STORY and found herself finally up on screen, playing a nun in THE SOUND OF MUSIC) is just wonderful as Eliza.
I:18729;618;Even her wonderful voice lets her down in that respect.
I:18729;619;mY FAIR LADY nevertheless is a classic and deservedly so.
I:18729;620;Product arrived in great shape and in a timely manner.
I:18729;621;This classic is definitely a must for those who enjoy the classics and collect them.
I:18729;622;Hepburn is one of the more elegant of the cinema stars.
I:18729;623;"My fair lady, an adaptation of George Bernerd Shaw's play ""Pygmalion""."
I:18729;624;from my point of view the movie, My Fair Lady is a fairly good adaptation of Shaws play'.
I:18729;625;From the point of view of producers and directors, it is understandable that they had to change the play in its movie adaptation in order to make it interesting to the viewers and maintain profits.
I:18729;626;For example the character of Henry Higgins maintained the feeling it gave us when we read the play.
I:18729;627;Rex Harrison's performance as Mr Higgins was indead one of the best Ive seen.
I:18729;628;He really kept the satire in his character.
I:18729;629;When Eliza embarassed him at the tea party and he put the tea cup over his head and turnd away, it was a funny bit of satireAudrey Hepburn also had an outstanding performance.
I:18729;630;She becomes a lady at the end of the movie and we can see that she cant return to the streets.
I:18729;631;This is one of the best musicals ever done.
I:18729;632;When viewing on the video sign kept coming up showing clean disc.
I:18729;633;This is one of my favorite movies ever.
I:18729;634;It was the first time I'd ever seen Audrey Hepburn or Rex Harrison, and I loved their acting instantly.
I:18729;635;This is a movie I could watch again and again.
I:18729;636;The musical scores and singing is so wonderfully done.
I:18729;637;The plot is beautiful, and I so enjoyed watching the progress of a phonetics master take on the biggest challenge of his life, by converting a poor girl right off the streets of London into a lady of society.
I:18729;638;"I remember seeing this when it premiered: a big theater in Hollywood
I:18729;639;one builds up a picture of the story that isn't borne out when one sees the whole thing.
I:18729;640;"and what's more, about all them have an upper feeling to them, even ones, such as ""Just You Wait"" that are, well, combative."
I:18729;641;To me, that means the movie has look good visually, move visually, and coordinate with the sound, especially the music.
I:18729;642;"There is an absence of a pleasing painterly composition within the frame (in contrast to what one sees in movies directed by Orson Welles, for instance)
I:18729;643;And there are the numbers, perhaps the best set of numbers in any musical: one classic after another.
I:18729;644;The casting also is very good.
I:18729;645;I can only be wistful regarding the peculiar magic of the Broadway cast, since that was before my time.
I:18729;646;It's certainly slick with regard to its so. called production values .
I:18729;647;especially the wardrobe, which is often fabulous .
I:18729;648;but that is mainly a matter of budget and technique, as opposed to artistry.
I:18729;649;This is an incredible film.
I:18729;650;One of the best screenplays every written, this is a true classic.
I:18729;651;Everyone involved with it's production does a superb job, and the movie is a joy to watch again and again.
I:18729;652;Colors are vibrant, and the sound is terrific.
I:18729;653;best of all the disc is packed with extra features!
I:18729;654;Amazon's price for this disc is a steal, so don't hesitate!
I:18729;655;This product came in excellent condition and played perfectly.
I:18729;656;I had never seen the movie, but had seen the play, so I enjoyed it a great deal.
I:18729;657;This is a all time time movie classic, rich entertainment great musical.
I:18729;658;This movie is for the true romantic type, that likes great acting with rich in music.
I:18729;659;packed with a chockful of extras that will keep you entertained for hours!!
I:18729;660;minute feature in a beautiful,high.
I:18729;661;definition transfer taken directly from the 1994 restoration print in its glorious 70mm Super Panavision format (2.20:1),but also has an excellent audio commentary by the film's art director Gene Allen,Audrey Hepburn's singing dub Marni Nixon,and the film's restorationists Robert A. harris and James C. katz which originally appeared in the previous '98 release.
I:18729;662;also included here are rare production featurettes such as the featurette The Fairest Fair Lady ,The 1963 Production Kickoff dinner,1964 LA Premiere,Oscar ceremonies,and much,much more!!!
I:18729;663;I bought it for my French daughter.
I:18729;664;Its story line should interest anyone learning to speak English.
I:18729;665;The differences in American and British culture add to the humor.
I:18729;666;I hadn't seen it since I was a kid and this movie is very funny and charming beyond anything I recalled.
I:18729;667;This is my favorite movie of all time and the Blu.
I:18729;668;this is my favorite movie of all time, its also on my favorite musical list.
I:18729;669;when i hear the songs it always make me smile.
I:18729;670;This is a wonderful musical that I enjoy whenever I watch it.
I:18729;671;It is so funny to see Eliza Doolittle sound out the vowels!
I:18729;672;Beautifully remastered both from the sound and the picture.
I:18729;673;The acting is tops and the actors are all beautiful people.
I:18729;674;the music is gorgeous and the story very romantic.
I:18729;675;The contrast between the biting satire in the original version and the lavish Hollywood production provides a plethora of opportunities for discussion.
I:18729;676;But the songs and sets and silly jokes seem to worm their way into students' brains despite their efforts to be blase, and it always turns out for the best.
I:18729;677;This musical is brilliant in the telling of the original George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion.
I:18729;678;The relationship with his mother is funny.
I:18729;679;Audrey Hepburn is funny, witty and beautiful.
I:18729;680;A more beautiful film, I cannot recall.
I:18729;681;Every fan of movies should see this masterpiece.
I:18729;682;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:18729;683;It is timeless and enjoyed by all ages!
I:18729;684;You will be humming the songs all day long!
I:18729;685;An all time classic, this movie is for everyone, the entire family!
I:18729;686;Jeremy Brett is super as is the rest of the cast.
I:18729;687;Great music, songs, and the film is an eye pleaser
I:18729;688;This is my favorite movie ever.
I:18729;689;They did a good job with it two.
I:18729;690;This is a sumptuous production, with glorious costumes, production design,sound, and Rex Harrison as the Professor.
I:18729;691;What makes this a freakish musical to me is that the leading lady can't even sing.
I:18729;692;should star in a stupendous musical like My Fair Lady.
I:18729;693;Those who heard Andrey Hepburn sing in real life said it was best the paying public didn't hear her.
I:18729;694;She had zero singing talent.
I:18729;695;I love this movie it's based on Bernard Shaws Pymalion.
I:18729;696;the play is a good read but the movie is great!Hepburn does a wonderful job and the girl can sing.
I:18729;697;It has a great message the same as in the play you are what you think you are, and society makes us if we let it.
I:18729;698;It's sure brilliant and you will be yelling at her to leave the jerk which is very amusing.
I:18729;699;You'll love this movie, it is a classic!
I:18729;700;It is a wonderful story, and film, and the music is just fantastic!
I:18729;701;This is such a fun film!
I:18729;702;I love the costumes, the music, and the actors!
I:18729;703;I was so excited to be able to get this in time for Christmas!
I:18729;704;So elegant, contained and coiffed.
I:18729;705;She was thrilled with the gift.
I:18729;706;A musical in the style of the BEST musicals ever starring two people who weren't known as musicians.
I:18729;707;Perhaps that is why it has become a classic!!
I:18729;708;Great music, great actors, fun story, beautiful costuming.
I:18729;709;it has so much for an entertaining time.
I:18729;710;Even your kids can watch it and enjoy it.
I:18729;711;it is one of our historical types of entertainment that has slipped away.
I:18729;712;Bring it back for your family by showing them this fun movie.
I:18729;713;What can one say about this movie with such excellent stars and scenery (although all shot in studio) it looked quite authentic.
I:18729;714;we thoroughly enjoyed the movie even though we have seen it before many times.
I:18729;715;This great musical is not without controversy.
I:18729;716;The snubbing of Julie Andrews in favor of the elegant but less.
I:18729;717;tuneful Audrey Hepburn is still a source of debate.
I:18729;718;winning stuff in Mary Poppins (same year, can you believe it?)
I:18729;719;After all these years, the sets, the otherwise superb cast, the glorious costumes and above all, Lerner and Lowe's matchless score are still magical.
I:18729;720;If you are a costume buff, check out the incredible skill used to stage the Ascot Racing Day scene.
I:18729;721;My generation enjoyed it when we were young, therefore it can still enchant young romantics.
I:18729;722;Based on Shaw's Pigmalion, it a costume piece with great music.
I:18729;723;My Fair Lady with Audrey Hepburn is my all time favorite movie.
I:18729;724;I have watched it several times and will continue to see it again.
I:18729;725;This movie is a classic for a reason.
I:18729;726;There are super funny parts, sad parts, a wonderful musical for the whole family!
I:18729;727;This is one of my favorite musicals.
I:18729;728;I have loved it for a long time, but was finally able to by it for myself.
I:18729;729;I love the songs and the characters, especially Colonel Pickering.
I:18729;730;I would recommend this movie to most anyone who enjoys a good musical, with some comedy intertwined in it.
I:18729;731;This film version is more complex, with more in.
I:18729;732;depth characterization, and is impeccably filmed with many imaginative and original touches.
I:18729;733;harrison is brilliant as Henry Higgins, and the supporting cast is first.
I:18729;734;The musical numbers are well.
I:18729;735;structured with a flair and zest which shows George Cukor's taste and sensibilities.
I:18729;736;The movie deservedly won eight Oscars.
I:18729;737;The movie's sumptuous sets seemed to lose out by this process.
I:18729;738;the movie is enlightening about the British class system which persists to this day.
I:18729;739;Higgin's mansion is artfully rendered, and the scenes in which the servants sing are captivating.
I:18729;740;this film captures the spirit, the style, and the genius of the musical and provides us with an archival record of the show.
I:18729;741;My Fair Lady is a great film and it had some great songs.
I:18729;742;rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn give great performances in what has to be the greatest movie musical of all time.
I:18729;743;It is Far better than The Sound of Music
I:18729;744;ray makes it even more wonderful.
I:18729;745;Everything works to make this classic a wonderful view to keep.
I:18729;746;The best musical ever Audrey Hepburn,Rex Harison and all cast superb and the musical score is magnificent, a joy to watchJohn LAustralia
I:18729;747;Old time classic, great stars, and priced right.
I:18729;748;for this viewer, this is quite simply the greatest musical ever made.
I:18729;749;I love fine story telling in print or on film as much as anyone else, but I generally look for some edifying content, something that reaches into the human experience emotionally or intellectually.
I:18729;750;This motion picture is unique among all I have seen in my lifetime where the pure entertainment value is so high, it requires no other qualities to make it completely worthwhile .
I:18729;751;This movie is a flawless balance of true.
I:18729;752;Every part of this production adds to the effect of enchantment.
I:18729;753;rex Harrison was born for this role, and Marni Nixon's singing voice, supplied for Audrey Hepburn, is out of this world.
I:18729;754;"Others, including Andy Williams, have recorded ""On the Street Where You Live"" over the years, but the pace, power, and clarity of Bill Shirley's singing is unequalled."
I:18729;755;"biz at its best, making good use of the timeless Pygmalion theme, and like other movies using this theme, doing it better than George Bernard Shaw
I:18729;756;This movie is an excellent teaching tool for schools and/or families, for although it is a highly entertaining classic Broadway musical comedy, it also accurately portrays the importance of mastering the English language, and how that skill influences everyone around you.
I:18729;757;This is indeed a true Classic.
I:18729;758;Lowe is fantastic with the recurring themes counterpoint string lines.
I:18729;759;Harrison is great and Hepburn is just a pleasure to watch on the screen.
I:18729;760;a musical I wanted in my library for years.
I:18729;761;this is a remake of Pygmalion and very well done.
I:18729;762;My Fair Lady is one of the American Film Institute's 100 Best Movies of All Time.
I:18729;763;professor Henry Higgins, played by Rex Harrison who won an Oscar for his performance in this picture, discovers her and her awful speaking skills and appearance, and boasts to her how he can make a duchess out of her.
I:18729;764;The next day at the Ascot races, which features some of the most marvelous costumes ever, she makes her debut in the most famous outfit she wears in the film next to the ball gown.
I:18729;765;"During the races when the horses pass, she hilariously shouts: ""Come on, Dover!"
I:18729;766;The scene ends ther showing that she will stay with Higgins!
I:18729;767;"Simply marvelous and ""loverly"" is ""My Fair Lady""!"
I:18729;768;They are uplifting, sometimes historical, sometimes funny and ALWAYS GREAT!
I:18729;769;I encourage YOU to read it!
I:18729;770;Our family loves old musicals.
I:18729;771;This one is so heart warming.
I:18729;772;Takes you away to another day and time when things were simpler.
I:18729;773;My Fair Lady is a good film and definitely worth watching.
I:18729;774;Storyline is good up until the ending.
I:18729;775;But, the music is wonderful and Hepburn's gowns are exquisite.
I:18729;776;Amazingly, this is a movie shot entirely on a movie studio sound stage with no special effects, yet one so compelling and unique that may never be duplicated with a sequel or remake .
I:18729;777;The sound track is exceptional.
I:18729;778;That's all good and fun and important questions.
I:18729;779;This is a favorite of mine and I believe I gave my other copy to one of my daughters.
I:18729;780;Who wouldn't, as Audrey Hepburn is wonderful.
I:18729;781;This is one of the few movies I've seen that I actually liked better than the book (Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion) even though the book was also good.
I:18729;782;Eventually her speaking skills become so good, that she is mistaken for royalty by a noted specialist in language(Theodore Bikel) and becomes envy of all the ladies and the desire of all the men(this is during the ball scene, one of the best and most exquisite parts of the movie).
I:18729;783;What makes this movie so marvelous is the actors and the music.
I:18729;784;the casting in My Fair Lady is perfect.
I:18729;785;the way she talks and carries herself are right on.
I:18729;786;Rex Harrison is also spectactular in the role of Henry Higgins and the two of them together have great on.
I:18729;787;Both of them are dynamic characters who learn from their experiences and change accordingly throughout the entire film.
I:18729;788;Holloway is hilarious as Alfie, Eliza's cockney father.
I:18729;789;The other, minor characters are also well.
I:18729;790;the most appealing thing about My Fair Lady is the music.
I:18729;791;known song from this movie and also the greatest.
I:18729;792;This is definitely one of the best movies I own.
I:18729;793;one I know I will probably end up watching over and over again.
I:18729;794;It's no wonder My Fair Lady won Best Picture(and many other Oscars) the year it was made.
I:18729;795;it has superb acting, beautiful costumes, terrific music, and also a mixture of comedy and romance.
I:18729;796;This is my Dad's favorite movie.
I:18729;797;The perfomanes are Oscar winning great.
I:18729;798;A great classic movie that everyone should own!
I:18729;799;I love Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, the music is beautiful, and Marnie Nixon's voice is glorious.
I:18729;800;I watch this at least once a year, and love it more every time.
I:18729;801;The photography is outstanding in this movie.
I:18729;802;They enjoyed it anyway with my explanations.
I:18729;803;This is a movie you watch over and over again.
I:18729;804;certainly it must have taken Audrey a certain amount of, well, balls, to use the Hepburn name when there was already a well.
I:18729;805;establish star with that name.
I:18729;806;It sort of boggles the imagination.
I:18729;807;Andrews is terrific on the legendary OCA, but the movie needed Audrey and that's where I stand on this momentous topic.
I:18729;808;Marni Nixon's fine, but Audrey is the real thing.
I:18729;809;Her presence is electric, and to see her match wits (or attempt to) with Rex Harrison's Professor Higgins, is pure joy.
I:18729;810;this film has a special place in my heart as one that I watch time and time again.
I:18729;811;Loved this story when I was young.
I:18729;812;Beautiful dresses and outrageous hats.
I:18729;813;One of my favorite movies!
I:18729;814;Highly recommend to anyone who likes musicals and has a sense of humor.
I:18729;815;One of the best musicals of all time.
I:18729;816;Gotta have it if you are a fan.
I:18729;817;I loved my fair lady growing up and married my wonderful lady who has a similar personality!
I:18729;818;other than that tiny thing, everything was perfect :D
I:18729;819;Mrs. Hepburn was very funny as well as dramatic.
I:18729;820;felt emotion and honesty from beggining to end.
I:18729;821;my Fair Lady is one of the best movies ever made.
I:18729;822;It is better than West Side Story, and Sound of Music because of its extraordinary and unique storyline.
I:18729;823;It is a superb movie that happens to be a musical.
I:18729;824;Besides its beautiful music, lyrics, actors, costumes, period sets, and any other categories of production, the viewer is captivated because of the most exquisite romantic comedy story ever written, with its intricate and witty dialogue.
I:18729;825;Only after several viewing one may capture the delicacies and nuances of the story and its characters.
I:18729;826;Every single line is as valuable as any other, and it has a meaning as profound as any other, and they are so engaging that once the movie is over one would not believe that 3 hours has elapsed.
I:18729;827;i definitely recommend the reading of both reviews by James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert from the movie database here at amazon.
I:18729;828;They have it right on the money and so well written.
I:18729;829;For goodness' sake, MFL is the forerunner of every reality makeover show out there, with a more worthy more than skin deep message.
I:18729;830;ish, Eliza is actually feminist.
I:18729;831;Winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, MY FAIR LADY proves that there is still plenty of life in musicals.
I:18729;832;Distributed by Warner Bros., produced by studio head Jack L. Warner, directed by woman's director George Cukor (Best Director), this film was a winner from the start!
I:18729;833;the musical numbers are, of course, fantastic!
I:18729;834;The numbers rival those of other Oscar.
I:18729;835;The serene look on Hepburn's face when she sings I Could've Danced All Night, for instance, is a wonderful example of forgetting the dubber and concentrating on the person on screen, namely Hepburn.
I:18729;836;Whoever Bill Shirley is, he is wonderful (with a rippling Butterscotch voice to boot).
I:18729;837;But, Hepburn did a great job .
I:18729;838;in conclusion, with 13 nominations and 8 wins, MY FAIR LADY brought out a classical film that inspired and touched people everywhere.
I:18729;839;They made this movie even more amazing with the improved picture and colors.
I:18729;840;I am so happy to own a copy of this classic on Blu Ray.
I:18729;841;This movie is sure to be a favorite for anyone who loves Audrey Hepburn or who enjoys musicals.
I:18729;842;Thanks for the great service!
I:18729;843;i love all her movies!!
I:18729;844;i want to make it very clear that I love cinema and that I love film musicals.
I:18729;845;i find the film version gorgeous to look.
I:18729;846;The singing, the instrumentation, and the artistry are infinitely superior to what is shown in the film.
I:18729;847;julie Andrews has proven her tremendous talent and devotion to her musical and acting craft over the years.
I:18729;848;I believe that she should receive Special Recognition from the film community.
I:18729;849;an apology from Warner Brothers would also be good for the studio.
I:18729;850;WB made a tremendous mistake both artistically and politically in not choosing Julie Andrews.
I:18729;851;My Fair Lady has always been a favorite movie.
I:18729;852;It has character and is fit for viewing for everyone.
I:18729;853;The product got in here right on time.
I:18729;854;I received great customer service.
I:18729;855;The task was then leveled to the TUBE to take this epic musical to task and remove much of what made it endearing, its wonderfully calculating color palette (eventually .
I:18729;856;The packaging was just as inventive: housed in a huge Laser/LP box which contained 3 discs .
I:18729;857;Miss Hepburn's vocals, I thought, were charming, and I more often watched that version.
I:18729;858;I sincerely hope that when WB makes their newest quantum leap, that they will return us that soundtrack.
I:18729;859;I bought this Special Edition and as I watched the ending I thought I would review it.
I:18729;860;And even her last name created a stigma for her as a flower girl turned into a Fair Lady.
I:18729;861;The ending really shocked me.
I:18729;862;What a wonderful ending that would have made.
I:18729;863;That is the ending that would have endeared millions and myself to this lovely story.
I:18729;864;But over all, it was well done and the acting is superb.
I:18729;865;Arrived quickly and it is a great movie.
I:18729;866;She has ALL and is from New Jersey where everyone talks to fast and does not pronounce their words correctly.
I:18729;867;Great for a lazy Sunday afternoon viewing.
I:18729;868;enjoyed every minute excellent musical.
I:18729;869;I would recommend this movie for all ages.
I:18729;870;This movie is a classic!
I:18729;871;I enjoyed it the last time I viewed it just as well as the first time many years ago.
I:18729;872;I love the songs and the premise of the movie.
I:18729;873;Excellent remake of Pygmalion story, including superior actors and environment.
I:18729;874;We received this in a timely matter.
I:18729;875;It is a gift, so they haven't watched it yet.
I:18729;876;I am a huge Hepburn fan, she has such a way when you are watching her you forget.
I:18729;877;she truly was a talented beauty of her time AND YES, my fair lady made me laugh!!!
I:18729;878;My Fair Lady turned me into a big fan of Audrey.
I:18729;879;Even the commentary in the Disc 1 was very informative.
I:18729;880;If you haven't seen this film yet, and like classic musicals, this is a magical film.
I:18729;881;Hepburn is mesmerizing as Eliza, the cockney flower girl who is transformed into a princess.
I:18729;882;It's a classic story that comes to life most winningly in this film.
I:18729;883;if you enjoy musicals from their golden age, you will want to see this one.
I:18729;884;It is the kind of film I can watch every year.
I:18729;885;A colorful wonderful story with great music.
I:18729;886;i likely classify myself as a senior citizen by admitting to liking this musical so much.
I:18729;887;Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn are very good as Henry Higgins and Elisa Doolittle.
I:18729;888;This musical dates back to the time when it was common to include more than one memorable song.
I:18729;889;spirited characterization of Eliza Doolittle.
I:18729;890;Mrs. Higgins is quite proper and perfect in every situation.
I:18729;891;Henry was taking a human life adjusted to a certain set of surroundings, modifying that life so that it no longer fit in, and was then prepared to cast that life adrift once he proved his point.
I:18729;892;in addition to a marvelous story, this movie boasts wonderful music and excellent sets.
I:18729;893;Nixon's singing was phenomenal and her singing voice is close enough to Hepburn's that it sounds as though Hepburn could be singing.
I:18729;894;Though the street scenes were excellent, my favorite set in the movie has always been Henry Higgin's incredible library.
I:18729;895;this movie won 20 awards, which includes eight Oscars.
I:18729;896;Rex Harrison won the Best Actor Oscar and the movie won the Best Picture Oscar, both highly coveted awards.
I:18729;897;"Harrison won many other awards for this film, and ""My Fair Lady"" became the most awarded movie of 1965."
I:18729;898;white have such incredible acting skills and such screen presence that they make this film a joy to watch.
I:18729;899;bound as I watched Audrey Hepburn become Eliza Doolittle and capture the hearts of everyone in the movie.
I:18729;900;Rex Harrison was incredible as Henry Higgins.
I:18729;901;This movie was either Harrison's best, or one of his best.
I:18729;902;the story is also captivating.
I:18729;903;Henry Higgins experiments with the life of a human being.
I:18729;904;My Fair Lady is one of the best musicals of all time.
I:18729;905;The combination of story, acting, singing and sets is amazing.
I:18729;906;Fans of musicals and love stories will enjoy this movie, even on multiple viewings.
I:18729;907;Lerner and Loewe is truly one of the best teams in musical theater.
I:18729;908;Costumes and art direction is excellent with some of the memorable songs written for a play.
I:18729;909;She absolutely loves the songs and was so happy to receive the special edition as her very own.
I:18729;910;This is one of the great movie musicals.
I:18729;911;I received it in good condition and on time.
I:18729;912;For those who are music lovers like myself, this is another good classic movie to add to your collection.
I:18729;913;Audrey Hepburn hit her peak with this movie.
I:18729;914;Her acting and signing superb.
I:18729;915;This movie so beautifully done.
I:18729;916;A brilliant adaption to this Broadway musical.
I:18729;917;audrey Hepburn ( Breakfast at Tiffiny's , The Nun's Story ) is perfect for the role of Eliza Dolittle.
I:18729;918;He has become the only person we could ever see in this role, as well as the first person who comes to mind when thinking about this film.
I:18729;919;Hepburn, while I beautiful actress, is a TERRIBLE singer.
I:18729;920;All in all, this is a beautifully made movie, deserving all the awards that were given to the show.
I:18729;921;The colors are vivid and the images are crisp.
I:18729;922;Just as I remember seeing it in the theater.
I:18729;923;Well, Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses of all time.
I:18729;924;She is/was so charming and convincing in every movie she made.
I:18729;925;This is a great classic movie!
I:18729;926;We had it when I was a kid but I was young and I didn't really appreciate it or have the attention span I think, but watching it again as an adult I liked it more.
I:18729;927;Love, love, love this movie.
I:18729;928;It is always so much fun to see the transformation of Eliza.
I:18729;929;Wish Rex could have found the happiness in his personal life that he succeeded in his films.
I:18729;930;I love this movie, I use to see every time.
I:18729;931;I love the songs they sang all over the movie.
I:18729;932;The work doing is e spectacular.
I:18729;933;It was in great condition.
I:18729;934;My Fair Lady is a great musical and a marvelous movie to go and watch, in my opinion is not a good interpretation of G. b. Shaw's, Pygmalion.
I:18729;935;We can clearly appreciate that most of the script is followed.
I:18729;936;"The middle class morality and the hypocrisy there could be in the upper class are scarcely represented
I:18729;937;the setting of the musical was great, I think that it concurred with the original play, and the costumes were ideal for the characters.
I:18729;938;In conclusion I think My Fair Lady is a great movie to watch more than once, yet it does not transmit the essence of Mr. Shaw's original play.
I:18729;939;its a great movie, and one everyone should see.
I:18729;940;It a historic gem of a movie w/great songs and characters.
I:18729;941;Great dialogue, fantastic sets and wonderful music.
I:18729;942;since she has a hearing problem she relies on this to watch films.
I:18729;943;This movie has marvellous lyrics and the acting of Audrey Hepburn in speaking with the accent of the flower girl to the sophisticated society lady is superb.
I:18729;944;I simply love this movie and have watched the original release on the big screen.
I:18729;945;Crystal clear and brilliant colors.
I:18729;946;Just what I hoped to get.
I:18729;947;A wonderful piece of work.
I:18729;948;It is an excellent video.
I:18729;949;"it that read ""Good Movie!"""
I:18729;950;it is packaging worthy of the lowest price budget BD's.
I:18729;951;But it is NOT packaging appropriate for the winner of several Oscars, including BEST PICTURE.
I:18729;952;"Hollywood rewarded Ms. Andrews with ""Mary Poppins"" and an Oscar, and although I'd love to have seen Julie Andrews in this role, 4 decades later I can't complain about Audrey Hepburn."
I:18729;953;white as Colonel Pickering, especially in the early part of the film, are witty, entertaining, and move the narrative right along without pausing for exposition.
I:18729;954;since George Bernard Shaw died in 1950 it's purely speculative to wonder what he'd have thought about the production of his Pygmalion story.
I:18729;955;I'm guessing he'd have liked it.
I:18729;956;If you like musicals, I'm guessing you will too.
I:18729;957;there are things I really enjoyed about this movie.
I:18729;958;Hepburn was nowhere near the singer Andrews was, but she was an accomplished film actress whose persona was well.
I:18729;959;She conveys Eliza's emotions with skill and subtlety.
I:18729;960;Director George Cukor's quiet camerawork does little to enliven things.
I:18729;961;My personal taste runs to more emphasis on dance in musical films.
I:18729;962;They know all the words to half the songs and I'll hear them singing them while they're playing together.
I:18729;963;Truly one of the greatest musicals ever made.
I:18729;964;they'll love it as much as you do!
I:18729;965;I'm thankful I have it now so I can watch it over and over and sing along!
I:18729;966;It's a unique story, and I love that the movie is full of drama, drama, drama.
I:18729;967;Still, it's a thrilling story with great filmography and amazing acting.
I:18729;968;The movie itself is magnificent (just wish I had it in Blu.
I:18729;969;My Fair LadyNot only is the story wonderful, but the singing and dancing were incredible as well.
I:18729;970;At the end she really was :one Fair Lady.
I:18729;971;My husband and I watch it frequently.
I:18729;972;We love the songs, the good acting, and the memories from when we first watched it in the 60s!
I:18729;973;a testament that you can do anything you put your mind to!
I:18729;974;This well performed, musical classic is a joy to watch.
I:18729;975;Great songs, wonderful costumes and a old fashioned romance .
I:18729;976;everyone in the story is a winner
I:18729;977;It spoiled the setting for this happy and enjoyable story.
I:18729;978;on the other hand the movie as a production remains a complete success.
I:18729;979;but here is my honest opinion of the film, and it's romantic plotline.
I:18729;980;First of all, it's beautiful.
I:18729;981;The scenery, the costumes, and the music.
I:18729;982;Not all love is eros and passionate.
I:18729;983;twenties, I find it real and heartfelt.
I:18729;984;This sort of thing is best decided by the individual.
I:18729;985;But one thing is certain, they are most wonderfully in love, be it conventional or unconventional.
I:18729;986;"Based upon the hit play ""Pygmalian"" by George Bernard Shaw and directed by George Cukor, the 1964 film ""My Fair Lady"" is a masterpiece of story, song and script that earned 8 Oscars and a total of 12 Oscar nominations in 1965."
I:18729;987;Eliza, of course, is insulted.
I:18729;988;Eliza learns over time, and a mutual love.
I:18729;989;the numerous wonderful songs in the film were written by Frederick Loewe and directed by Andre Previn (who received the Oscar for Best Music Adaptation).
I:18729;990;"* ""Show Me"" (5/5, Marni Nixon and Bill Shirley) Eliza and Freddie leaving Henry's home together."
I:18729;991;My Fair Lady deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture, as did George Cukor for Best Director.
I:18729;992;The film also won Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costumes and Best Sound.
I:18729;993;I rate this film with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys superb acting and musicals.
I:18729;994;"The actor playing ""Liza's"" father almost steals those scenes he appears in!"
I:18729;995;There are places they sprusted.
I:18729;996;On my projector, the left had greenish tones, the 70.80% in the middle looked good, and the 10% on the right was pinkish.
I:18729;997;This is completely unacceptable, especially for masterpiece!
I:18729;998;The audio, while better than anything I have heard on home video, should also has been improved.
I:18729;999;So sad for such a distinguished movie!
I:18729;1000;"maybe the rights will be transferred again and a more respectable studio will release it in the manner that ""Sound of Music"" was restored."
I:18729;1001;She was a wonderful actress, this is a must movie if you love her, this is a classic!
I:18729;1002;This is the kind of movie that you'll long remember for the strong characters and catchy tunes.
I:18729;1003;Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn are simply great and the supporting cast perfectly placed.
I:18729;1004;This is a story you'll want to come back to often so it's worth owning.
I:18729;1005;Great music and lyrics, the beautiful Audrey Hepburn, great actor Rex Harrison, and a superb supporting cast.
I:18729;1006;I watch this once a year to experience what great musical productions can be made instead of the crap we are getting today from Hollywood.
I:18729;1007;This is such a beautiful classic.
I:18729;1008;Fox missed a great opportunity of transferring this classic onto blu ray.
I:18729;1009;There is a white shade on both sides of the widescreen picture and the middle looks normal (which ain't saying much).
I:18729;1010;"Fox needs to recall and refuse to sell this particular title on blu ray until they fix the problem and give this classic the ""true"" restoration it truly deserves."
I:18729;1011;It is in marvelous 7.1 and sounds great!
I:18729;1012;those I thought I really enjoyed.
I:18729;1013;It has its wonderful moments but Rex Harrison is tough to always love.
I:18729;1014;Audrey Hepburn is what makes this movie great.
I:18729;1015;Well, I just picked this up and it is delightful.
I:18729;1016;Real chemistry between Harrison and Hepburn.
I:18729;1017;Hepburn's acting performance is just fantastic, and she really deserves all the praise for being one of the finest actresses in film history.
I:18729;1018;and you have quite the actress.
I:18729;1019;Shipped in a good amount of time, bought this as a gift so I didn't unwrap the shrink wrap, but everything seems to be in order.
I:18729;1020;This is a wonderful movie that is a clasic for all generations.
I:18729;1021;I have watched it since I was little and still enjoy it to.
I:18729;1022;The music, for one thing, is incredible and catchy.
I:18729;1023;The acting is marvelous, and it is a pity that Audrey didn't get an oscar for it.
I:18729;1024;Got this as a gift for my hubby.
I:18729;1025;She took Broadway by storm in My Fair Lady.
I:18729;1026;She got a LITTLE gig called Mary Poppins .
I:18729;1027;AND she got her Oscar for Best Actress for Mary Poppins.
I:18729;1028;And thet world knows it.
I:18729;1029;her accent is way believable.
I:18729;1030;ANd her singing voice is unmatchable.
I:18729;1031;Well, Rex Harrison was wonderful on the upside.
I:18729;1032;He pleaded with Jack Warner to use Julie.
I:18729;1033;but it is well known that Julie's career outlasted Audrey's.
I:18729;1034;For Julie is still decking out major movie hits as we speak.
I:18729;1035;and Audrey well, I loved her in Breakfast At Tiffany's and may she rest in peace.
I:18729;1036;well, we cant have it all can we?
I:18729;1037;I was so excited to gift this to my mom for Christmas.
I:18729;1038;package it somehow before I give it to her.
I:18729;1039;My Fair Lady is a timeless classic and it is probably one of my favorite musicals.
I:18729;1040;I love absolutely everything about it: the songs, the acting, the exsquisite costumes, beautiful sets, the delightful humor and the brilliant acting.
I:18729;1041;This movie defines what great musicals are all about.
I:18729;1042;The way she played the role was so convincing and the way she could grasp that cockney accent was sheer brilliance.
I:18729;1043;Rex and Audrey make a terrific team in this movie, they really shine.
I:18729;1044;My Fair Lady how sweet it is!
I:18729;1045;I have always liked musicals, and I especially liked this one.
I:18729;1046;Even though I liked the book better, the musical has many acting scenes in which many characters sing.
I:18729;1047;I say so because the music involves singing well and having a nice voice, which might have put into second plan the true intentions of Pygmalion.
I:18729;1048;Because the movie portrays a specific perspective of the play, and the Pygmalion another one, I obtained more knowledge about Shaw's point of view and about his complex personality.
I:18729;1049;an inspired choice since Rex had already made the part his own on Broadway.
I:18729;1050;With a little bit of luck and a lot of comical training the job gets done and the result is a truly charming story elevated by exceptional production values and a thoroughly engaging musical score!TRANSFER: OUTSTANDING!!!
I:18729;1051;Colors are rich, vibrant and solid.
I:18729;1052;Black and contrast levels are perfect.
I:18729;1053;The audio has been remixed to 5.1 and is brilliant, robust and thoroughly engaging for a film of this vintage.
I:18729;1054;The sets are breathtaking, the costumes are remarkable and the cast superb.
I:18729;1055;Probably my favorite musical if not movie.
I:18729;1056;I certainly hope a new transfer is done for its 50th anniversary in 2014.
I:18729;1057;I am Big huge fan of Audrey Hepburn!
I:18729;1058;One of my favorite movies all time along with the Breakfast in Tiffany, Sabrina, Roman Holidays.
I:18729;1059;Shared this marvelous musical with my granddaughter and she loved it.
I:18729;1060;This movie is exceptionally great, if you are a music lover.
I:18729;1061;hepburn and Harrison are great together.
I:18729;1062;I'm not saying that she speaks really well in the movie but she speaks a bit better than how she really is in the book.
I:18729;1063;what a great movie audrey is such an amazing actress!
I:18729;1064;she plays this role so well i recommend this to veryone!
I:18729;1065;Nearly my favorite thing remain the opening credits, with the time.
I:18729;1066;lapse photography of the beautiful peonies.
I:18729;1067;Too finally have this movie in my collection of musical's makes me happy.
I:18729;1068;It's very cool to havethe opportunity to shop here.
I:18729;1069;Thanks to my family for recommending this web.
I:18729;1070;I always enjoyed this movie .
I:18729;1071;saw it as a teen and this Blue Ray is so much nicer to watch and sound is much better.
I:18729;1072;the acting is superb, the costumes fantastic .
I:18729;1073;One would loved to have seen her do it, but Ms. Hepburn is awfully good, if dubbed.
I:18729;1074;This item was a gift for a young teenager.
I:18729;1075;As it was my favorite movie, I hope she will like it too.
I:18729;1076;I sing all the songs and appreciate all the costumes.
I:18729;1077;It is a great movie!
I:18729;1078;Musicals are not my cup of tea, but I've watched this one several times and enjoyed it each time.
I:18729;1079;The music arises naturally out of the story and joins one scene to another beautifully.
I:18729;1080;It is a fairy tale, of course, in which a poverty.
I:18729;1081;Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison make this story both believable and delightful.
I:18729;1082;This has always been a family favorite.
I:18729;1083;We bought this film to share with our 10 year old granddaughter since she loves to sing and enjoys playing with the english language.
I:18729;1084;She enjoyed every bit of the musical.
I:18729;1085;With the words at the bottom of the screen, our granddaughter enjoyed singingalong with most of the songs.
I:18729;1086;Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn were magnificent in this film.
I:18729;1087;They were both so talented and Audrey was so beautiful.
I:18729;1088;The singing and acting were superb.
I:18729;1089;My Fair Lady is, as some critics have argued, perhaps the perfect musical.
I:18729;1090;I've heard some of her tracks, and they were perfectly passable.
I:18729;1091;an extra bit: Check out the original London stage recording with Julie Andrews, the first Eliza.
I:18729;1092;It's a beautiful, sometimes breathtaking album, wherein Andrews reaches perfection herself.
I:18729;1093;Audrey Hepburn is an icon and my favorite actress.
I:18729;1094;I had seen this before and loved it and particularly Hepburn.
I:18729;1095;There's hope for all of us.
I:18729;1096;I love her feistiness and her good looks will always be remembered.
I:18729;1097;Andrews got her digs in when she won an Oscar for The Sound of Music.
I:18729;1098;my Fair Lady is a classic.
I:18729;1099;It's a social experiment that succeeds only too well, as Eliza takes society by storm and captures the hearts of several men, including Higgins himself.
I:18729;1100;And wonderful timeless songs: Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man, I Could Have Danced All Night, The Rain in Spain, On the Street Where You Live, etc.
I:18729;1101;"It's more than a movie
I:18729;1102;Low price is also a benefit!
I:18729;1103;This musical brought from teh Broadway stage .
I:18729;1104;of George B. Shaw's Pygmalion is absolutely great.
I:18729;1105;But the costumes, songs and performances are fantastic.
I:18729;1106;Watch Audrey Hepburn's treatment as her accent slowly evolves from a London street woman to an elegant sophisticated woman.
I:18729;1107;The best transfer ever of the film on a video medium.
I:18729;1108;Colors are quite gorgeous and stand out as the transfer's best asset.
I:18729;1109;dressed socialites leaving the opera forward, the transfer yields sparkling hues, generally well.
I:18729;1110;balanced and harmonious, looking as exquisitely natural as ever.
I:18729;1111;Even the bright white social circle scenes and the very warm interior of Higgins' office offer stability and evenness.
I:18729;1112;Fine detail is strong, but not perfect.
I:18729;1113;In a year of Kubrick's riveting `Dr. Strangelove' and Lester's creative `A Hard Day's Night', `My Fair Lady', is more like Hitchcock's masterpiece `Marnie' of the same year.
I:18729;1114;"These two latter films
I:18729;1115;So why does `My Fair Lady' stand out as my personal best of the year?
I:18729;1116;Because you could fill an arena full of directors from the beginning of cinema to present day and there would only be a handful, which project such talent and ease for this kind of material!
I:18729;1117;Cukor's film is filled with wonderfully executed scenes, without the aid of extravagant sets and when he builds a large set of a race track, he does it with minimal means and only the camera and editing to give it the panache, it needs to succeed as a sequence.
I:18729;1118;When directors were starting to lean on big, unusual sets as in `Dr. Strangelove' (which I love) or on modern day sensibilities and wild camera movements, as in `A Hard Day's Night' (which l also love), Cukor was proving, simplicity and style could make superb, intellectual entertainment!
I:18729;1119;four's most original statement was `My Fair Lady'!
I:18729;1120;Has there ever been a more famous musical.
I:18729;1121;MY FAIR LADY is a musical adaptation of Bernard Shaw's play PYGMALION.
I:18729;1122;it enjoyed a long and successful run on Broadway with Julie Andrews starring as Eliza Doolittle.
I:18729;1123;Ironically Julie Andrews won the Oscar for Best Actress in that same year for her appearance in MARY POPPINS.

I:18729;1132;Timeless classic with superb acting from Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison.
I:18729;1133;The music and lyrics from Lerner and Lowe are in a class above today's mediocre musicals.
I:18729;1134;warming plot, colorful costumes and characters, beautiful sets.
I:18729;1135;they all contribute to a complete musical.
I:18729;1136;its one of the old great classics.
I:18729;1137;Rex Harrison was so perfectly cast and Audrey Hepburn was so well chosen as Eliza.
I:18729;1138;It was such a pleasure to see it again and in wide screen format (the original version vs. the tv formated video version).
I:18729;1139;Ok, Audry does not have the strongest voice but it was nonetheless great to hear her sing.
I:18729;1140;Only West Side Story and The Sound of Music can compare with this lavishly designed, profoundly well.
I:18729;1141;acted rendering of the Broadway smash hit that people still love today.
I:18729;1142;Rex Harrison in the role of his career won the Best Actor Oscar to no suprise that year for his brilliant portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins.
I:18729;1143;The previous year's best actress winner Patricia Neil (winner of 1963's Hud ) had just had a life.
I:18729;1144;When Harrison won he asked Audrey to stand next to him on the podium to thank her as well as Julie Andrews (who was in the audience and who ironically won the best actress Oscar that same year for Mary Poppins while Audrey was not even nominated for Fair Lady .
I:18729;1145;due to the fact that the Academy wanted to punish her for stealing the part from Julie) for allowing him to work with the two of them and expressed his deep love for.
I:18729;1146;well two fair ladys .
I:18729;1147;Audrey and Julie were all smiles backstage for publicity pictures with Harrison, best director winner George Cukor (who had won his 1st Oscar [for director of Fair Lady ] after at five nominations) and Jack L. Warner (who won the best picture Oscar for Fair Lady ).
I:18729;1148;This film is really a milestone in the history of musical films.
I:18729;1149;See it if you havn't already and see it again if you have.
I:18729;1150;It's always worth another look.
I:18729;1151;1964's My Fair Lady was the screen version of the popular Broadway play.
I:18729;1152;Rex Harrison reprises his role as the professor and the beautiful Audrey Hepburn is the flower girl, Eliza Doolittle.
I:18729;1153;Noted director George Cukor creates vivid sets and stages subtle, yet enjoyable musical numbers.
I:18729;1154;My Fair Lady is a classic Hollywood musical and cleaned up at the 1964 Academy Awards winning eight times including, Best Picture, Mr. Cukor for Best Director and Mr. Harrison for Best Actor.
I:18729;1155;My mother had watched it years ago and so we both split the price so that she could see it again and so I could watch it for the first time and LOVED it!!!!
I:18729;1156;I think it's great to be able to share this childhood memory with my girls.
I:18729;1157;I bought this to help learn a Cockney English accent for the audition.
I:18729;1158;amazon were great and delivered as and when they said they would.
I:18729;1159;Great show, what a princess!!!
I:18729;1160;I highly recommend this movie.
I:18729;1161;I laughed out loud, I enjoyed the song and dance numbers.
I:18729;1162;Good for kids and adults.
I:18729;1163;In fact, that adds to the appeal.
I:18729;1164;Audrey Hepburn is perhaps the most beautiful actress to ever grace the screen in my humble opinion.
I:18729;1165;Here, she shines and is only a wall flower for the first part of the movie.
I:18729;1166;Later she blossoms into an exquisite woman who could win the heart of any man.
I:18729;1167;It is truly her best acting.
I:18729;1168;"(Reminiscent of ""Trading Places"" to give a modern example) It is just irresistible to the professor and so he takes on a challenge for six months."
I:18729;1169;You will enjoy his eccentric view of life and cunning attitude as he tempts Eliza with chocolates.
I:18729;1170;The script is superb and humorous in so many places.
I:18729;1171;professor HigginsHiggins and Eliza have quite a few passionate verbal exchanges which are quite amusing.
I:18729;1172;While Eliza learns to speak well, Higgins learns to love well.
I:18729;1173;The ending is unpredictable and cute.
I:18729;1174;The movie is sumptuously filmed and it is undeniable witty and sophisticated.
I:18729;1175;The costumes and hair styles are the most elegant I have ever seen.
I:18729;1176;If you enjoy ironic, intellectual comedy, be prepared to also fall in love with the most irresistible songs of all time.
I:18729;1177;This enduring classic could not have been pulled off without Audrey Hepburn.
I:18729;1178;You will want to own your own copy so you can watch it again and again.
I:18729;1179;My Fair Lady is a GEM on her crown of success in films.
I:18729;1180;One of my favorite movies to watch over and over again.
I:18729;1181;It's definitely one of the best musicals produced.
I:18729;1182;If you like musicalsyou will love this one.
I:18729;1183;My Fair Lady stands as one of the great musicals of the post.
I:18729;1184;mGM era, largely on the strength of the original play and it's cast.
I:18729;1185;"And if he's a bit old for the part, we are still lucky to be able to see the brilliance or his ""original"" Henry Higgins."
I:18729;1186;Yet, he is touched and changed by Eliza.
I:18729;1187;Stanley Hollaway also reprises his role of Alfred Doolittle with the deft touch of the music hall veteran that he was.
I:18729;1188;audrey Hepburn, the Julia Roberts of her day, is radiant, vulnerable, and finally regal as Eliza.
I:18729;1189;It is one of her best performances, and a wonderful use of her talents as an actress, dancer, and star.
I:18729;1190;and Eliza is a singer's role.
I:18729;1191;I think we are all lucky to have had the enjoyment of seeing (or hearing) both actresses play the role.
I:18729;1192;Eliza is a part that demands the best of a performer.
I:18729;1193;the team behind the camera makes great contributions.
I:18729;1194;Harry Stradling Sr.'s cinematography is great mainstream sixties camera work.
I:18729;1195;As a matter of fact, George Cukor pretty much gives him the Ascott scene as a costume set piece.
I:18729;1196;(Hepburn's dress alone is a testament to how costume builders can take a few squiggly lines from a designer and turn them into a real work of art in fabric and feathers.)
I:18729;1197;He treats the legendary Broadway show pretty much as if he was filming Shaw's play.
I:18729;1198;"Contrast this work with Robert Wise's ""Sound of Music"" which opened a year later."
I:18729;1199;"Lady is clearly the stronger source material, yet ""Music"" floats on the energy of its score and Ernest Lehman's script."
I:18729;1200;but while Cukor's vision does not add much to the property, he gets out of the way and lets his actors and production team put on a first class rendition of the show.
I:18729;1201;my Fair Lady is still a wonderful evening's entertainment.
I:18729;1202;The cast, the score, the story, the design are all first rate.
I:18729;1203;If it lacks a little in imagination and pace, well that's a small price to pay for a piece of theatrical legend.
I:18729;1204;This was a gift sent to a friend.
I:18729;1205;If an improved version comes along, then I'll go for it as well.
I:18729;1206;But for now, I've seen a most enjoyable, and satisfying movie.
I:18729;1207;Great costumes and period furnishings.
I:18729;1208;"Good thing I know the movie by heart PLUS it has ""closed captioning""."
I:18729;1209;Other than that, my friend and I completely enjoyed the movie.
I:18729;1210;It arrived SO QUICKLY and the price was SO affordable!
I:18729;1211;I'll do all my Christmas shopping at Amazon!
I:18729;1212;It is a timeless classic and I am looking forward tom watching it again with my family.
I:18729;1213;This was my late husband's very favorite movie.
I:18729;1214;it provides many hours of entertainment and enjoyment.
I:18729;1215;the extras are nice, including a commentary by film restorers Robert Harris and James Katz, Marnie Nixon (I think that's her name), who was the singing voice of Audrey Hepburn, and someone else whose name escapes me.
I:18729;1216;It's pretty a pretty informative track, and particularly interesting to me because I like this film restoration stuff.
I:18729;1217;oh, and the film is great too :.)
I:18729;1218;It's based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, which is also the basis of She's All That.
I:18729;1219;It's wonderful to see Eliza's transformation from a flower vendor with a cockney accent to someone who could pass for a princess.
I:18729;1220;Although this film is long, it is very entertaining.
I:18729;1221;the film is good and the extras really give you bang for your buck.
I:18729;1222;The picture is amazing and the audio, which won an Academy award, is amazing as well.
I:18729;1223;Delivered as promised, nicely packaged.
I:18729;1224;She was beautiful and talented.
I:18729;1225;She plays the part perfectly.
I:18729;1226;I have the Laser Disc version of this film along with the special features.
I:18729;1227;With all the advanced technology available to modern pressing plants, is this the best they could do?
I:18729;1228;I suspect today's youngsters would also find this movie highly entertaining.
I:18729;1229;This is a lovely victorian drama, with absolutely first rate acting and wonderful music.
I:18729;1230;I bought it because my daughter likes musicals and I wanted to provide something with more nuance than MTV videos.
I:18729;1231;Happily, she loves it and watches it with delight several times per year.
I:18729;1232;It has nurtured her love of music, moving it in new directions.
I:18729;1233;I really, truly hope that the success of MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO will help revive the musical.
I:18729;1234;Moreover, there is a wealth of musical talent among actors today.
I:18729;1235;Kevin Spacey and Hugh Jackman, for instance, are enormously talented, and Mandy Patinkin is a major stage musical talent, yet has never been able to make a film musical.
I:18729;1236;The production itself is superb, striking just the right tone and atmosphere throughout, and one has to love the set and art design.
I:18729;1237;On the one hand, I am a huge Audrey Hepburn fan, and I love her work in this film.
I:18729;1238;Although for the most part her singing was dubbed by the incomparable Marni Nixon (it is fascinating to hear the outtakes of Hepburn's own singing, which, while not up to the level of Nixon's, was much, much better than Natalie Wood's singing in WEST SIDE STORY, which Nixon also dubbed), she acted her role superbly, and it is hard for me to imagine anyone else playing the role.
I:18729;1239;Among many others, Cary Grant and George Sanders were both considered for the film.
I:18729;1240;Grant was actually quite a good singer, and although he never made film musicals, had performed in a number of musical productions before entering the movies.
I:18729;1241;Still, the thought of Grant singing versus Harrison's inimitable spoken performances of his songs does not make one wish Grant had gotten the role.
I:18729;1242;Harrison is so perfect that one imagines his playing the role an act of fate.
I:18729;1243;Again, I love Cagney, but the role belongs to Holloway.
I:18729;1244;And with the wonderful performances, the great sets, the extraordinary songs (including my favorite, The Street Where You Live ), and the marvelous costumes, what room for complaint is there?
I:18729;1245;Audrey Hepburn is radiant and touching as the poor flower seller Eliza Doolittle who challenges her mentor's makeover powers, before eventually passing for a lady in London society.
I:18729;1246;She is skillfully transformed into an elegant lady by a speech professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and taught to speak properly.
I:18729;1247;From first frame to last, the film is slick, graceful, gorgeous to behold, with costumes and sets richly evoking the Edwardian era.
I:18729;1248;in the best tradition, their first songs reveal their characters: 'Wouldn't It Be Loverly?'
I:18729;1249;lerner and Loewe's songs are shear delight as the story moves from Higgins's wager with sympathetic Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde.
I:18729;1250;"Higgins and Pickering are both single men, and the housekeeper, Mrs. Pearce, has misgivings about the way in which they are proposing to amuse themselves without caring about the consequences for the ""common ignorant girl."
I:18729;1251;The songs are extraordinary in their ability to enrich our knowledge of the characters.
I:18729;1252;Alfred Doolittle's 'With a Little Bit of Luck ' not only states his general philosophy of life, but exposes the perfect portrait of a friendly scoundrel.
I:18729;1253;"Eliza's father, who calls himself one of ""the undeserving poor"" is one of Shaw's best comedy creations."
I:18729;1254;The music is also a logical extension of the characters' feelings.
I:18729;1255;The scene leads to one of the most triumphant sequences in musical history.
I:18729;1256;"She instantly charms a young admirer Jeremy Brett (Freddy) by her slightly odd manner of speaking, who later haunts Higgins' house (""On the Street Where you Live"")."
I:18729;1257;Her exercise is an unqualified success.
I:18729;1258;Her waltz with the Queen's son, and other dance partners, spreads throughout the audience about her identity.
I:18729;1259;I can stand on my own without you.
I:18729;1260;I can do bloody well 'Without you!
I:18729;1261;the climax is a great ending to a great musical.
I:18729;1262;'My Fair Lady' has great style and beauty.
I:18729;1263;The motion picture is humorous, notably the wonderfully steamy bath in which Prof. Higgens' female staff cleanses the accumulated dirt of the street off Eliza Doolittle.
I:18729;1264;with the dazzling splendor that director George Cukor offers: the designer's eye for detail, the painter's flair for color, the artist's imagination, and the delicacy of handling, the film garnered no less than twelve Oscar nominations, and took home eight statuettes including Best Picture of the year, Best Actor.
I:18729;1265;Cukor, as well as Best Art Decoration, Sound, Scoring, Costume Design, and color Cinematography.
I:18729;1266;This is one of my favorite moviesof all time.

I:18729;1272;My most favorite musical/movie ever!
I:18729;1273;Audrey Hepburn Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway are unforgettable.
I:18729;1274;If you have somehow missed the film this is a musical even people who don't like musicals will be won over by.
I:18729;1275;The supplemental commentaries on the disc are fascinating and discuss the restoration process at length.
I:18729;1276;The colors are rich and vibrant and show the subtle details of all the costumes.
I:18729;1277;I am frequently a little disappointed with the Surround Sound on many films but this fills the room with lush magnificent sound that is just spectacular.
I:18729;1278;music, settings, costumes all outstanding, audrey hepburn is perfection.
I:18729;1279;Have always loved Audrey Hepburn and this is a classic.
I:18729;1280;I love musicals and this, coupled with Audrey, is definitely a winner!
I:18729;1281;My favorite musical :) Audrey Hepburn is fabulous and beautiful and the story is classic.
I:18729;1282;Everyone of all ages should see this!

I:18729;1285;She was magnificent in the play and went on to become a great star without this cinematic vehicle.
I:18729;1286;The dresses she wears are gorgeous, as good as I've ever seen in the movies.
I:18729;1287;other that that one flaw, this is a beautiful piece of work.
I:18729;1288;And Harrison is perfect in the role, as he was on stage, right down to his demand for his slippers in the final line.
I:18729;1289;In fact, all the characters are fine.
I:18729;1290;Very happy with this acquisition.
I:18729;1291;Movie soundtrack, I still play the music often.
I:18729;1292;I loved the movie except for the final scene.
I:18729;1293;with Eliza exiting in triumph .
I:18729;1294;Great value and works as expected
I:18729;1295;I had seen My Fair Lady as have most people and enjoyed it.
I:18729;1296;I recommend it to all who love to be uplifted when they see a movie.
I:18729;1297;I highly recommend this musical movie to anyone.
I:18729;1298;The songs and costumes are lovely.
I:18729;1299;I'd give it five stars if I could.
I:18729;1300;It's a movie for the entire family to enjoy.
I:18729;1301;Audrey Hepburn gives one of her best performances of her career.
I:18729;1302;She as well as Julie Andrews will both always be remembered in the roe of Eliza.
I:18729;1303;He's a very wonderful actor as well.
I:18729;1304;Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn were so great together in this marvelous movie.
I:18729;1305;Amazing how the technology today can convert such an old movie to such a modern perfect picture.
I:18729;1306;This was also a gift for my granddaughter.
I:18729;1307;She is very fond of Audrey Hepburn films and loves musicals.
I:18729;1308;I would highly recommend this film.
I:18729;1309;My Fair Lady is one of the greatest film musicals of all time.
I:18729;1310;She starts out not being the elegant film goddess that we are used to seeing in her previous films.
I:18729;1311;The music and the cinematography is really good.
I:18729;1312;It deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture.
I:18729;1313;This film is a musical that tends to make people laugh more than the others do.
I:18729;1314;It is nice to have a few good laughs in films that are lead up to be boring and pointless, even though they are not.
I:18729;1315;I highly reccomend this film for anyone and everyone.
I:18729;1316;I originally saw this at Rhode Island College as a play and it was very nice.
I:18729;1317;as it is stated above that the subtitles are in Portuguese .
I:18729;1318;just wish I could see all the words.
I:18729;1319;A classic in its own right, but this set is well worth the price.
I:18729;1320;I thoroughly recommend it to anyone.
I:18729;1321;I have just finished watching MFL in english class, and I must admit that I ABSOLUTELY loved it.
I:18729;1322;a. long songs really touched my heart, I cant wait for the moment to see it again.
I:18729;1323;although I ABSOLUTELY loved this film, I enjoyed the book like a hundred times more.
I:18729;1324;The only downside I see to such an impressive masterpiece is the fact that much of Shaw's humor, and views are striken from MFL.
I:18729;1325;But nevertheless I am compelled to agree with anyone in all their senses, that without doubt this is an ABSOLUTE classic.
I:18729;1326;A real gem of a film.
I:18729;1327;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:18729;1328;I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.
I:18729;1329;Overall a very good experience.
I:18729;1330;I highly enjoy this comical love story.
I:18729;1331;She is amazing and will always be remembered as such.
I:18729;1332;Ah the satisfaction to find another actress in this time as delightful and wonderful as Audrey.
I:18729;1333;Harrison is perfect as the crusty, eccentric Higgins.
I:18729;1334;This is a wonderful, feel good movie with great acting and terrific music.
I:18729;1335;This is a splendid example of a splendid movie.
I:18729;1336;My Fair Lady gives richly to its audience through its gorgeous sets and costumes, vibrant and exhilirating music, crisp and memorable performances, and perfectly stylized direction.
I:18729;1337;Stylized enough to win the picture a rare eight Academy Awards including 1964's Best Actor, Best Director, and the coveted Best Picture.
I:18729;1338;George Cukor directs the prodution with a trademark flourish and wit that makes it an even greater pleasure to watch.
I:18729;1339;winning role) meets up with a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (a perfectly endearing and charming Audrey Hepburn).
I:18729;1340;There are some genuinely great scenes with Hepburn and Harrison during several unorthodox speech exercises, which are very witty.
I:18729;1341;The golden songs are spectacular and still popular today, such as Wouldn't It Be Loverly?
I:18729;1342;And the film is absolutely a motherlode of beautiful scenes: Hepburn and her Cockney friends dancing to Loverly , Hepburn, Harrison, and Hyde.
I:18729;1343;Every scene is beautifully painted in glorious Technicolor, adding only another splash to this elegant spectacle.
I:18729;1344;My Fair Lady is a timeless entertainment, a film that should be seen at least once.
I:18729;1345;and I guarantee you that if you do see it once, it won't be enough!
I:18729;1346;Lerner and Loewe's musical version of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion is a pleasure from beginning to end.
I:18729;1347;Special kudos are due a very amusing Wilfred Hyde.
I:18729;1348;A particularly pleasant surprise in this film is a young Jeremy Brett, known to many as Sherlock Holmes in his later years, portraying Freddie Aynsford.
I:18729;1349;"I do not know whether Brett was revoiced or did his own singing
I:18729;1350;If you are an admirer of musical theatre, or of any of the actor cast in this production, this is a must for your collection.
I:18729;1351;Yes, it is a nice Cinderella story, and Audrey plays a fine role.
I:18729;1352;there is an excellent message about the ingrained Brit Class System circa 1910.
I:18729;1353;and there are some nice costumes, mainly women's hats, at the Horse race.
I:18729;1354;add to this a few memorable songs.
I:18729;1355;True, Pickering is a nice counterpoint, and really a decent old chap, but Higgins is the main character, and to watch and listen to this old goat goes well beyond a pleasant way to spend time!
I:18729;1356;about the only thing new is the songs, which are fun and amusing, but not really in the top tier of great musical tunes.
I:18729;1357;I found it interesting to hear Rex Harrison speak.
I:18729;1358;He is very good at it.
I:18729;1359;She loved it and am going to have her watch other old musicals too.
I:18729;1360;This is an example of the great movies we used to enjoy.
I:18729;1361;Julie Andrews acted and sung the pact perfectly.
I:18729;1362;But it's ok because Julie won an Academy Award the year My Fair Lady came out anyway.
I:18729;1363;And you gotta love Rex Harrison, who also created the role of henry higgins alongside Julie Andrews on Broadway.
I:18729;1364;Everyone knows this is a fantastic movie.
I:18729;1365;I like this as a classic musical.
I:18729;1366;The songs fit well with the dialogue and story.
I:18729;1367;This has always been a favorite remake of Pygmalion set to music.
I:18729;1368;A must have for anyone who loves old movies .

I:18729;1376;special features include a very interesting commentary by those involved in the film, including the singing voice for Eliza Dolittle, and cut scenes where Hepburn actually sings her own part.
I:18729;1377;There is also trailers and a My Fair Lady promontional included.

I:18729;1380;in a very well kept secret, not revealed until a 1994 documentary.
I:18729;1381;Actually, Hepburn and Brett are wonderful as Eliza and Freddy in the movie.
I:18729;1382;And Andrews has her Oscar as ample compensation.
I:18729;1383;The loverly songs seem to jump out at you, and the color is magnificent.
I:18729;1384;The preservation job they have done, documented on the lengthy and extensive 1994 documentary hosted by Jeremy Brett on disk two, deserves a Special Oscar.
I:18729;1385;man, I love this movie!
I:18729;1386;I could watch it again tonight for four hours (including bonus material), just for the glorious songs and the witty story.
I:18729;1387;"As Eliza slowly becomes someone elegant and smart, we get some of the most beautiful songs in the American musical theatre, including ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"""

I:18729;1393;It is a satisfying ending to a fabulous show, filmed to perfection by an army of pros on both sides of the camera.
I:18729;1394;My only complaint is that the informative 1994 documentary has the movie clips in squeezed or pan/scan format and not wide.

I:18729;1401;The cast is excellent (even though Audrey Hepburn is just lip synching her songs).
I:18729;1402;I liked the way the script developed several of the supporting characters.

I:18729;1409;My Fair Lady is a uplifting film with really good costumes and is positive.
I:18729;1410;I'd recommend this movie to anyone wanting to watch an old fashioned musical that's fun.
I:18729;1411;Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison truly had perfect chemistry.
I:18729;1412;Stanley Holloway was also excellent as A. p. Doolittle.
I:18729;1413;It won 8 Oscars for a reason.
I:18729;1414;This is a richly layered story.
I:18729;1415;Humor , music and the angst of human foibles are finely meshed into an improbable story.

I:18729;1419;The music flows through the movie like a cool breeze.
I:18729;1420;My Fair Lady is the legendary director George Cukor's crowning achievement.
I:18729;1421;Every element of this movie works, from its sumptuous photography by veteran cameraman Harry Stradling, to the glorious costumes and sets created by Cecil Beaton.
I:18729;1422;Frederick Loewe's melodies are lovely and infectious and Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics are every bit as witty and touching as the dialogue originally written by playwright George Bernard Shaw for Pygmalion .
I:18729;1423;the transformation of the illiterate, unwashed Eliza Doolittle into the breathtaking Fair Lady of the film's title is inspiring to see.
I:18729;1424;This is one of Audrey Hepburn's best roles, and she is perfection as Eliza Doolittle.
I:18729;1425;She is thoroughly convincing as the Cockney flower girl who transcends her humble roots to end up dancing with a prince at an embassy ball.
I:18729;1426;Hepburn expertly translates Eliza's tenacity, vulnerbility, intelligence, and grace into a beautiful and timeless performance.Yes, it's true that Julie Andrews (who created the original Eliza on Broadway) was bypassed for this role.
I:18729;1427;Audrey was an established star with a great track record.
I:18729;1428;It is one of the best musicals ever written for stage or screen.

I:18729;1432;This needs to be seen and enjoyed.
I:18729;1433;I was surprised by how much of the song lyrics I had remembered from watching this movie MANY years ago as a kid.
I:18729;1434;This is one of those movies you can watch again and again, and enjoy it every time.
I:18729;1435;Other than this, the product is very good.
I:18729;1436;In the film I see people like those I actually know!
I:18729;1437;Rex Harrison is masterful as Henry Higgins, and Audrey Hepburn does a delightful job as Liza Doolittle.
I:18729;1438;A film that still has appeal and charm after almost 40 years!
I:18729;1439;Audrey is my favorite actress of all time, so I'm a bit biased, but I'm also a huge fan of Julie and I know she would have done this role brilliantly.
I:18729;1440;The colors are vibrant, the designs are brilliant, the scope of the Super Panavision 70 fills my eyes with visual beauty.
I:18729;1441;The audio is also excellent.

I:18729;1451;The strange affection /hate relationship between Eliza Doolittle and Higgins is one of the main things that represent the rare, yet exceptional factors of G. b. Shaw's satirical themes.

I:18729;1462;This is a wonderful story that gets richer in multiple tellings.
I:18729;1463;Every time I see it I am happy with it.
I:18729;1464;this particular edition also gives insight into the production process that helps to connect with where the play came from.
I:18729;1465;March 2006 marked the 50th anniversary of the opening on Broadway of Lerner and Loew's My Fair Lady.
I:18729;1466;Fifty years later we are still humming the songs from this beautiful play.
I:18729;1467;In the mid.1960s Audrey Hepburn brought Eliza Doolittle to the silver screen.
I:18729;1468;Despite the fact that it's not Audrey singing, she took to the role of Eliza as if it was especially created for her and gave a magnificent performance.
I:18729;1469;I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.
I:18729;1470;From the cast to the music, from the sets to the costumes, from the atmosphere to the script, My Fair Lady remains one of the most beautiful and succesful musicals ever that has been brought to the big screen.
I:18729;1471;It is an enjoyment for both eye and ear and stil keeps audiences humming the songs long after they have seen the film.

I:18729;1474;hepburn's performance is one of a kind.
I:18729;1475;She gives the character of Doolittle a heart and a soul like no other actress could have done.
I:18729;1476;and even though Rex Harrison's character Henry Higgins isn't always likable in what he says, he is terribly funny and the way he uses his voice is absolutely fantastic.
I:18729;1477;the film may feel a bit dated to the younger generations, it remains a true masterpiece that still makes the hearts of many beat faster.
I:18729;1478;The costumes are beautiful and the sets are also.
I:18729;1479;You can really see that months and months have been put into the production of the film.
I:18729;1480;But thanks to fantastic professionels, the film has been beautifully restored and gives the film back the colorful and fresh look it should have.
I:18729;1481;The audio has also been restored which brings the songs and music in their fullest and most beautiful form.
I:18729;1482;A fascinating documentary shows what happened and how the film was restored.
I:18729;1483;It also shows a great welth of footage behind the scenes of the film, how it was made and produced back in 1963.

I:18729;1485;direction that pleases your eyes, and music that your ears will fall in love with, My Fair Lady is one of a kind and has been that way many years.
I:18729;1486;worth every star given on top of this review.
I:18729;1487;The colors and music shine like a diamond, and the voices of Harrison, Hepburn/Nixon, are clear and crisp in the Dolby 5.1 and match up to the video beautifully.
I:18729;1488;The enchanting story is back, and this time it will stay.
I:18729;1489;The part of Higgins played by the great Rex Harrison is brought to life by intricate acting.
I:18729;1490;He brought this same style to the big screen.
I:18729;1491;The musical soundtrack is wonderfully accurate and the noise is substatially low.
I:18729;1492;To the best of my recollection, this is a perfect rendition of the movie.
I:18729;1493;The classic story still delights the latest generation.
I:18729;1494;Frederic Loewe's glorious music is perfectly complimented by Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics, as on the Broadway and London stages, and almost every song is memorable and great.
I:18729;1495;Second, the gloriously witty script, filled with great lines, many taken directly from Shaw, on whose play Pygmalion this was based, and sharp commentary on Britain's class system.
I:18729;1496;lauded stunning look of the film, with gorgeously stylized costumes by Cecil Beaton and fine sets by Beaton.
I:18729;1497;All the ingredients are there for a great film, and under George Cukor's direction, that's pretty much what you get.
I:18729;1498;And her voice double, Marni Nixon, has a lovely voice, but doesn't really put any emotion into her songs, forcing that ever.
I:18729;1499;But overall, it's a vastly entertaining, enjoyable, romantic, and great experience, just not without flaw.
I:18729;1500;at times the picture looks beautiful, and will blow you away.You really can notice the extra detail.
I:18729;1501;She is perfect and My Fair Lady is one of the few perfect musicals.
I:18729;1502;She sings in Funny Face and her voice is not bad.
I:18729;1503;This special edition of the 1964 Oscar winner, MY FAIR LADY is worth every penny!
I:18729;1504;The film looks great after its extensive restoration and the audio commentary is great to listen to.
I:18729;1505;The extras include that wonderful documentary about the restoration of this classic!
I:18729;1506;One of the finest musical films ever produced makes its (triumphant?)
I:18729;1507;the transfer used on this disc was fairly impressive for its time and looked rather brilliant on a standard definition TV.

I:18729;1509;scaled with a competent blu.

I:18729;1511;the movie itself is a real gem.
I:18729;1512;But I'm guessing if you're reading a review of the blu.
I:18729;1513;A newer, far more satisfactory edition, will definitely be on the horizon in the next few years.
I:18729;1514;fascinating to see how close the film wasto being lost before it was restored.
I:18729;1515;Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses.
I:18729;1516;in this movie she is fantastic.
I:18729;1517;love the acting and the beautiful sets.

I:18729;1520;It's sheer delight from start to finish.
I:18729;1521;My Fair Lady is in my Top Ten favorite movies and one of my favorite Audrey Hepburn movies.
I:18729;1522;It has a great soundtrack!

I:18729;1524;Wonderful, It Was Indeed A Great Musical, It Won 8 Academy Awards Including Best Actor: Rex Harrison, Best Director and Best Picture of 1964
I:18729;1525;In this scene she is just incredibly beautiful, as this dress provides just the right accent for her elegant figure!
I:18729;1526;I also enjoyed her character's amusing efforts to blend upper class manners with cockney wit!Another element of this movie that I found interesting is the origin of the story itself.
I:18729;1527;As the stage musical was inspired by George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, it is interesting to note that Shaw's character Henry Higgins was based, to some degree, upon the Oxford philologist Henry Sweet (1845.1912), whose specialty included the study of Old English (see Sweet's famous bookAn Anglo.
I:18729;1528;and to such a degree, that by comparison, Henry Higgins would seem to be steeped in the social graces!
I:18729;1529;I enjoyed it the second time as much as the first.
I:18729;1530;"Shaw's persistent and comical sincerity humanizes the social class difference, marriage, and various themes which are presented throughout the play and brings comedy and drama to a more ""real"" level."
I:18729;1531;"The film ""My Fair Lady"" was nominated as the best musical of the year in 1964, presenting the best duplicate of the play Pygmalion."
I:18729;1532;The whole point of the satire and the exaggerated humor and ridicule was constructed to show the myth of Pygmalion, and disappeared due to the whole concept of the movie.
I:18729;1533;The switching of the themes in the film portrays another feeling than that Pygmalion.
I:18729;1534;Eliza, the flower girl, acted by Audrey Hepburn was a beautiful woman whose performance was great in showing real emotions, like her attitude and her way of speaking, but lost all the original emotions when the musical part appeared.
I:18729;1535;Eliza's affection towards Higgins was showed during a musical solo that the flower girl performed.
I:18729;1536;The satire and cynicism presented by Shaw was swept away throughout the whole firm.
I:18729;1537;In the film we can see that it ended by Eliza staying at Higgins house.
I:18729;1538;All time classic musical/drama/love story.
I:18729;1539;no matter your economic circumstances, with the right help anyone can succeed.
I:18729;1540;This edition tops the 1995 laserdisc by allowing the sparkling, exemplary design of its 70mm.
I:18729;1541;The 4.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is powerful and clean, but since this film was originally mixed for six.
I:18729;1542;Nonethless, the film sounds terrific.
I:18729;1543;The extra features make this package a bargain at the price.
I:18729;1544;Full length commentary by director George Cukor, with the musical numbers presented sans vocals, is a great touch.
I:18729;1545;"And the two documentaries are beautifully presented
I:18729;1546;This is an old story that has been told many times in movies but it is still a favorite of mine.
I:18729;1547;This is probably the only movie that I could watch each night, and still laugh like crazy and sing along the tunes.
I:18729;1548;based on G. B. Shaw's novel Pygmalion , My Fair Lady is a musical that had a great success on Broadway, before George Cukor masterfully filmed it.
I:18729;1549;All the actors, with no exception, are extraordinary.

I:18729;1551;the songs are beautiful and funny at the same time.
I:18729;1552;and many others that will move forever in your heart and memories.
I:18729;1553;lenght commentary packed with interesting details on the actors, the making, etc., and the singing voice of Eliza Doolittle (masterfully played by Audrie Hepburn), Marni Nixon, talks about some behind.
I:18729;1554;There is also a featurette and a very nice Making of.
I:18729;1555;They have saved a musical masterpiece.
I:18729;1556;I will probably watch it at least once a year.

I:18729;1558;This movie is wonderful and the price was right!

I:18729;1560;This is one of my favorite musicals, along with 1776.

I:18729;1562;His teaching transforms Eliza who becomes the rage of London society.
I:18729;1563;She returns to a happy ending.
I:18729;1564;rex Harrison is perfect as the pompous, self.
I:18729;1565;Her performance is one of her most brilliant and a star in her crown of achievement.

I:18729;1576;watch factor makes it a film to own.
I:18729;1577;in 1994, the film was restored and thank the lord they did!
I:18729;1578;I have both so I feel qualified to answer this.

I:18729;1582;"the songs featured here are also unforgettable, my personal faves being
I:18729;1583;The extra footage was worth paying for.
I:18729;1584;My Fair Lady is one of the greatest film musicals of all time.
I:18729;1585;She starts out not being the elegant film goddess that we are used to seeing in her previous films.
I:18729;1586;The music and the cinematography is really good.
I:18729;1587;It deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture.
I:18729;1588;This film is a musical that tends to make people laugh more than the others do.

I:18729;1594;What always draws me to this movie, though, is the incredible performance turned in by Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins.
I:18729;1595;for a basic plot summary, My Fair Lady is a grand experiment proposed by uber.
