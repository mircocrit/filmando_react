1;Moulin Rouge, 1952 filmThis is a movie about Henri de Toulouse.
2;lautrec, the French painter who lived at the end of the 19th century.
3;That top knot hairstyle was in fashion for women then, rather than traditional long hair.
4;The subject matter of this film was considered scandalous at the time.
5;Henri paints the women and scenes of his era.
6;He uses live models in his rooms.
7;A pushcart license created economic freedom and independence, says a model.
8;Henri and other artists talk about their business at a restaurant.
9;[Most people are happy when they can criticize someone else.]
10;This movie recreates scenes of Parisian life.
11;He touches up a painting, then turns off the gas jets.
12;Performers at the Moulin Rouge criticize one of his paintings.
13;We see girls dancing the can.
14;La Goulue is the star.
15;henri sketches the patrons and performers of the Moulin Rouge.
16;One is bought by the King of Serbia!
17;Will an early death cause his paintings to soar in value?
18;Henri discusses love in a cynical way.
19;Henry and his lady friend visit the races and then a theater with a variety show.
20;The Louvre will hang his paintings in his lifetime, a great honor.
21;the Red Mill had a bar, restaurant, and dance floor.
22;even then I could appreciate a touching movie.
23;i would recommend this movie to anybody, especially younger people who may not have had the chance to see it otherwise.
24;Ruined a beautiful film by cutting it up to fit a tv screen.
25;If any film can be close to history, this Moulin is one.
26;Consider the production, Making of Lust for Life which furnishes the background for the Kirk Douglas classic, and how and where it was filmed on actual locations in France.
27;in the Making of Lust for Life Kirk Douglas speaks with living people who knew Van Gogh, and what a great experience.
28;these four films represent a great period in art history, and artists, young and old, should be able to view these products inthe best technology available
29;These films are vibrant and alive.
30;the contribution of these production outweighs the efforts of the spoilers who would very likely throw out the Mona Lisa assome smiling insignificant lady of the night.
31;moulin Rouge (1952) was an Oscar winner for stunning art direction, set decorations, and costumes.
32;This is a depiction of an actual human being, not fictional.
33;It is magnificent in it's colorful production, with many memorable characters as they must have been in reality.
34;Among the most interesting aspects of this powerful story were the strong, if not subtle, contrasts.
35;The performances were all perfectly good, within the constraints of the narrative.
36;Curious final effect: the whole was better than the parts, and it's a definitely a film worth watching more than once.
37;It's a 50's movie and I get a kick out of the special effects and some of the make up jobs.
38;Miss Gabor even looked good way back then!
39;Moulin Rouge a feast for the eyes as well as the mind.
40;Unlike John Hustons, ( Oswald Morris,) cinematography of sepia style in Moby Dick Huston here creates a world of great hues and colors.
41;Costumes, sets and art direction are tops.
42;in a lifetime, this is one that should be viewed on the big screen.
43;Henri de Toulouse Lautrec was a great painter and somewhat a philospher.
44;Hollywood made a great picture of his life
45;This is one of the most interesting biographies I've ever seen on film.
46;I was stunned to see how spectacular the colors were and how much it helped capture the flavor of the dance hall and the cobblestone streets of France 100 years ago.
47;This movie is a feast for the eyes.
48;This way, you don't have to strain to understand the French accents, notably Colette Marchand's, and it makes this intriguing story even better.
49;wise, it's a bit of a soap opera but one I still found fascinating, thanks mainly to Lautrec's dialog.
50;He had some really interesting things to say, mostly in a cynical way.
51;this is truly a masterpiece on film.
52;the previous reviews describes thismovie so well.
53;Born of French nobility, Latrouse.
54;lautrec felt incapable or unworthy of being loved by a woman.
55;And what a thing of beauty his visions are!
56;lautrec was still able to channel his passion into his indelible works of art.
57;Including Lust for Life, Moulin Rouge is probably the best biography of a painter I've ever seen on screen.
58;He embodies all the conflicts and contradictions of the man with few histrionics.
59;Moulin Rouge is a work for the ages.
60;& it must've made a great impression on me, because I've wanted, for years, to re.
61;I would definite recommend this to anyone, especially someone who loves art and/or has a background in art.
62;Through John Huston's directorial talents, the colors of Toulouse.
63;lautrec, the physically deformed son of a noble family, whose condition causes him to empathize with societal outcastes,played with all the elegance of the nobility by Jose Ferrer, who, in a dual role, also portrays the artist's father.
64;In the grand tradition of artists, Toulouse.
65;one interesting character who is absent from the story is the red.
66;lautrec make innovations in art as a draftsman, and gain stature in his profession,and the character of the Moulin Rouge change from a bawdy dance hall to a more sophisticated societal club.
67;The pauses in which the artist's sketches dance across the screen are truly a feastfor the eye.
68;elegant surroundings do not alter Henri's view of love or his cynical, self.
69;Maybe the video has enhanced it.
70;the real Moulin Rouge has yet to be made as the new film leaves a lot to be desired
71;this is one of my favorite.
72;I am a francophile, French speaker, and a student of that very complex culture of post revolutionary France, as well as an art history bush.
73;lautrec has always fascinated me.
74;He was the greatest innovative artist in the history of art, in my opinion.
75;It is a film filled with vibrance and color, fantasies and fact and any art lover cannot h elp but enjoy The actors were truly well.
76;Jose Ferrar did a msgnificent job as the lead character.
77;FGabor was her sparkling self,.
78;I believe it is one of John Ford's better efforts and provides some historical background for several of Toulouse.
79;If you are a young person and not familiar with his work this provides a quickie lesson on his style and time.
80;If you are older and familiar with his work you should also feel at home.
81;A host of real paintings, borrowed from several sources, are a bonus.
82;The music is the real thing.
83;the editing is excellent and one scene flows gently into the next.
84;Acting by Jose Ferrer and Eva Gabor is very good and convincing.
85;The scenes and action fit the paintings superbly.
86;in my opinion, this Moulin Rouge beats the 2001 version hands down and there is absolutely no similarity.
87;This was always my favorite version of Moulin Rouge.
88;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
89;Jose Ferrer does an excellent job, as do all cast members.
90;lautrec is a brilliant but oddly remote portrayal (an odd mix that characterized Ferrer).
91;The real Lautrec was an artistic outlaw of his day, a complex, talented, intractable rebel whose work was often considered pornographic (if only those critics could see Nicole's movies!)
92;but who helped change 19th century sensibilities and even invented new printing processes.
93;but Bubbles, Bangles is still a hauntingly lovely tune.
94;Flaws aside, this movie has many seriously brilliant moments.
95;The color is simply terrific, with many shots worthy of a gallery showing.
96;Some disappointments: with so much fascinating history behind the film's crew and the story's real.
97;Great fun to see this exellent film about Touluse.
98;can recommend this film to all lovers of Paris.
99;Jose Ferrer made a knock.
100;the most astounding portrait of Lautrec ever made .
101;in this absorbing biography that focuses around the troubled life of T. l. His affective universe and the search of his bliss are highlighted with a solid script, notable cinematography and superb custome design.
102;All the cast is splendid.
103;Another filmic jewel of John Huston that unforgettable and hyper.
104;And, of course, cinema is an art.
105;each is a statement by great visual directors depicting visual art.
106;Moulin Rouge is the story of the great artist.
107;Its excellence is due to the handiwork of John Huston and Jos Ferrer .

136;in my opinion, this is the best version of Moulin Rouge.
137;In all honesty, the new version used to be one of my favorite movies until I saw this version.
138;Every time I watch this version, I love it more and more.
139;His paintings are beautiful and he's an amazing artist, however, I'm writing my review from an emotional standpoint.

152;Although it's difficult to capture any biographical film to the most intrinsic detail, this film does provide a well.
153;I can listen to Jose ferrer's melodic voice forever!
154;He was an excellent actor and a very believable Lautrec.
155;The scenery is authentic and beautiful.
156;The artwork presented in the film really gives a complimentary example of Lautrec's outstanding imagination.
157;Other major stars, like Zsa Zsa Gabor are enchanting to watch!
158;it is a wonderful film, glorious in color, dancing and spectacle.
159;I like this original version of Moulin Rouge much better than the newer one with Nicole Kidman in it.
160;First of all, despite the tragic life of Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, this is a happy movie.
161;The exuberance of the can.
162;The script is admirably balanced, and the character development is superb.
163;But herein lies the movie's weakness, which is that it tells more about these people than about Lautrec's study and growth as an artist.
164;Another plus is that this film really captures the spirit of The Gay Nineties.
165;Also, it gives a pretty good idea of the Art Market
166;This is a film that should be viewed with a bottle of French Champagne,a feather boa, and a poodle with a very frou.

179;Jose ferrer makes a great Toulouse latrec, which is more the focus of the film even as the name is moulin Rouge
180;Now nearly 60 years later it is just as beautiful as my child's memory recalled it.
181;The Technicolor process is gorgeous.
182;And, Jose Ferrer, that underestimated actor from Puerto Rico, was wonderfully cynical in the roll of Lautrec.
183;The very first widescreen movie was The Robe, 1953.
184;Enjoy it for lush sets and wonderful performances, all directed by a man who knew exactly how to use every single inch of a 4:3 screen, John Huston.

189;Huston skillfully directs an excellent cast while blending seamlessly Oswald Morris' cinematography with George Auric's musical score.

193;this film is a feast for the eyes.
194;At least for about two hours, it enables us to return to Paris near the end of the 19th century, to a world which remains vivid in the great art of Seaurat, Renoir, Degas, Monet, Manet, Bonnard.
195;Moulin Rouge (1952) is John Huston's tribute to the artist (he wrote and directed this film), which brings vividly to life the Paris of the 1890s and especially the famous Moulin Rouge of the period, complete with amazingly faithful recreations of the music hall's characters that Lautrec immortalized in his paintings and that seem to have jumped right out of the artist's canvas.
196;Idly staring at an unfinished painting, he abruptly gets up and adds a brush stoke.
197;And then stroke after brush stroke while in his excitement and never leaving the canvas he reaches for the windows and closes them, reaches for the gas and shuts it off.

200;This film transfer is absolutely flawless.
201;So beautiful, it's like a painting in 3.
202;The set designs and costuming alone make this a classic film.
203;This is a great biography of a truly gifted artist.
204;It brings Paris to life in both its grand side and its seamy side.
205;It is a pg movie with a lot of information about laTrec and also the times and the reasons for his art and his death.
206;If you like Jose Ferrer, it is one of the two greatest movies in which he ever starred.
207;His other great movie is Cyrano de Bergerac.
208;It's a biography of the renown French artist Henri de Toulouse.
209;He would spend time at a local cabaret, Moulin Rouge, where he'd find inspiration for his art, as well as fuel for his increasing alcoholism.
210;I'll leave that for you to discover.
211;Jos Ferrer is great as the protagonist with his commanding voice and interesting dialogues.
212;His commentaries on life are brilliant and brutally honest, but also cynical.
213;The story is both entertaining AND thought.
214;My wife and I had some good discussions after the film.

216;This is an important part
217;fINAL WORD: Make no mistake, Moulin Rouge is a masterpiece.
218;It's the perfect antidote to modern 'blockbuster' drek.
219;Disregard the fact that it was released in 1952, particularly if you have a distaste for old movies, as Moulin Rouge is a timeless film both hugely entertaining and thought.
220;After watching my wife expressed how much she liked the film and thanked me because she would have never chosen it on her own.
